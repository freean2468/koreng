Sir, can you turn the music down? Oh, yeah. All right. [volume lowered.] Down means off. Well, I'm-- I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding. I've been using the cruise control, so I-- No, sir. Your windshield. License and registration, please. Right. Uh This-- This was from Wayfarer 515. Um, my house was in the debris field. Okay. Uh, and that's-- that's what shattered my windshield-- some piece of wreckage from the plane. I understand. Yoknow of-- of Flight 515, the plane crash? You're wearing the ribbon. Yes, sir. I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515. I was one of the first responders on the scene that day. Then what are you doing? Citing you, sir. What? What, you don't believe me? Sir, regardless of how that windshield was damaged, this car is unsafe to drive in this condition. Stay in the car, please. Wait. Wait just a minute. Just one minute. Sir, I asked you to stay in the vehicle. No, no, no. I can get out of my own car. Sir, listen-- No, no, no. You listen to me. It's time for you to listen to me. Sir, what you need to do is take a deep breath, calm down This is America. and get back in that car now. I have rights. Do you understand that? At least have the common decency to hear me out. I need you to step back right now. Did you even hear what I said? Sir, calm down. Now you're giving me a ticket? I told you that my house was in the debris field. Do you have the remotest inkling of what that means? Sir, calm down. Hellfire rained down on my house Sir, I need you to step back now. where my children sleep! There were body parts in my yard! Sir, this is your last warning. You gotta be kidding me! You got about two seconds to stand down, or I'm gonna pepper spray you. You're gonna pepper spray? Perfect! That is just perfect! Pepper spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment! [groaning.] [police radio chatter.] [door closes.] [Hank.] Lastly, a little something from down El Paso way. Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border. Truck turn out to be a chicken run out of Juarez and Laredo. Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years. But this time, as soon as they made it acro, someone hit them-- hit them hard. We're talking a driver and nine illegals. No sign of the shooters. This truck was carrying more than just people. What are we looking at? Weed, coke, or meth? Nah. Doesn't look like they were transporting narcotics. So, why did the Border Patrol kick this to us? They didn't. I pulled it. You ask me, ths high-end cartel work. Los Zetas, maybe. Question is, why do we have Juarez-style action on our side of the DMZ? They sending a message or clearing a path? Or was this about stopping one particular border-hopper? Maybe one of those extra-crispies knew something he shouldn't. Anyway, keep your eyes open. All right. That's it. Slow news day. Add one more to the countdown. Oh, yeah? What's that, Gomie? We're waiting on that famous blue meth of yours. Yeah, well, it's still out there, Gomie. Don't worry. [phone ringing.] Local PD. I gotta take this. Gomie, go beat your piÃ±ata. Rest of you jokers- too d--- quiet in here. Go catch some bad guys. Schrader. Hey, what's up, Paul? What? [tool whirring.] [hammer banging.] [muttering.] Jesse? Hey, Dad. So you're fixing up the house, huh? Doing a little work, yeah. Uh, I'll bounce. It's-- It's cool. You doing okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. I just happened to be driving by and saw the sign. So, you're selling the place. [chuckles.] In this market. Can you believe it? I see you moved the garage. That's bold. Your mother's idea. It's quite an operation. We did, all new stucco, all the master suite, sandblasted, fumigated the basement Right on. Yeah. Fixing up the place totally increases resale value. I read that in- I want to say, like, Time magazine. So, what'd you do with the upstairs bathroom? All redone. New tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens, granite countertops, new appliances-- all top of the line. D---. That's great, Dad. Think, uh, I can get a tour? Eh, these guys are trying to finish up. Maybe we'd better stay out of their way. There are pictures on the Web site, if you wanna take a look. Cool. You're looking healthy. I'll tell your mother. She'll be happy. Thanks. You know, I could come by sometime for, uh, dinner or something. Yeah. Sometime. Okay. Later, Dad. [Hank.] You know, look, he's a high school teacher over at Wynne. Never been in trouble a day of his life. Found out he's got lung cancer, and now his wife kicks the poor b------ out of his own house. I mean, look, guys, if anybody rates a little slack, here's the guy. [sighs.] Hey, Walt, uh, you remember Officer Cavanaugh? Officer, I'm very sorry that I lost my tper. There's no excuse for my behavior. It was disrespectful. [muttering.] She's divorcing me. Oh, I don't know what to tell you, buddy. It is what it is. She doesn't want me to see the kids. She said that? Yeah. [engine starts.] [seat belt alarm dinging.] You don't write? You don't call? G--. It's a disaster. It is not a disaster. Oh, okay. It's not a disaster, all right? She's not going to the cops. She's not gonna tell a living soul. You wanna know why? One word: "blowback." [chuckles.] If she blabs, it'll be a disaster for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Whew! Screwed. You were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue-sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids-- Paging Dr. Phil. My daddy's a drug dealer, and my mommy turned him in. And the house-- gone. The feds will come and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Ooh, good luck arguing with them on that. No. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing, and she knows it. Her going to the police is not the point, Saul. She's out of my life. Do you understand? I've lost my family, everything that I care about. Hey, buddy, [chuckles.] uh, it's bad. All right It's a calamity, but we live to fight another day. And after a decent interval of time, well, [sighs.] there are other fish in the sea. You've been out of circulation for a while. I mean, you'll be just amazed at what's out there. Thailand, the Czech Republic I mean, those women are so grateful to even be here. In the meantime, idle hands are the devil's playthings, so, uh, you should get back on the horse and do what you do best. First step: talk to our friend and get cooking. I can't be the bad guy. What? I can't be the bad guy. Okay. [chuckling.] Uh You know, we'll, uh-- we'll revisit. Just, uh, promise me you won't hang yourself in the closet. [chuckles.] [sighs.] [bell ringing.] Pop-pop! Pop-pop, the ice-cream man! Ohh Huh? [chuckles.] Don't tell your mom. Okay. [phone ringing.] Yeah. [Saul.] It's me. We may have a wife problem. Uh-huh. Look, I need eyes on it. You got an address? Hey, dinner's gonna be late. Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie are bringing takeout. But, uh, if you're hungry, I could rustle something up. * [continues.] Okay. [chopsticks clicking.] Hey, buddy, pass the ketchup, will you? What? I've had enough trans fat for one lifetime. A two-day drive from the nearest ocean, and you're eating raw fish. That's all I'm saying. Mmm. Been a while since that minnow been swimming. Right, buddy? [laughing.] You know, um, Flynn, uh, here is looking for a part-time job, so I don't know. If you know of anything, you might wanna-- My-- My name's Walter Jr. Like-- Like-- What, you-- you can't even say his name? Um, if you've changed your mind about being called Flynn, all you need to do is just tell me that you don't want to be called Flynn. You know what? Dad didn't even show up till fourth period, and his eyes were all red like he'd been crying or something. But you-- you don't even care. And now, he won't even drive me home. He won't say why, but I know it's because you told him not to. Honey, I-- What? I don't know what your problem is. You may not love him anymore, but I do. I mean, why you gotta be-- Why-- Why you gotta be such a-- a b----? Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. Oh Hank-- Hank-- Hank-- You don't talk to your mom that way. It's-- It's-- It's all right. Hey. Hey. [door slams.] Skyler, I know that you must have your reasons forall of this. I Sky, uh, [clears throat.] I-- I know it's none of my business, but, uh, keeping Walt from the kids [muttering.] You're right, Hank. It's none of your business. [quietly.] Oh, my G--. After all of that, please tell me that you are still not curious. There's nothing to be curious about. [scoffs.] Please. The day I heard there was a second cell phone, I knew. Believe me. I've seen it a hundred times. Okay. All right. So, what? Stop dancing around it. What is it exactly that you have seen a hundred times? Please, please, enlighten me. Look, a guy like Walt-- a nice guy, decent, smart, you know? Let's face it-- underachiever, dead-end life, okay? He gets cancer. Time's running out. Midlife crisis. He acts up. Steps out. Then the wife-- she catches him. I mean, it's a story as old as time. Look, do the math, Marie. Only comes out one way. Knowing Walt, he, uh, felt so guilty, he probably told her himself. Yeah, I-- [mutters.] I don't know. I think if he cheated on her, that she would've told me by now. It just feels like something more. [car alarm chirps.] Yes, yes, yes. 24-7 coverage. Need you ask? How much is this gonna run me? [laughs.] J----. I'm in the wrong business. Yeah. I'll call you. [phone beeps.] Return of the prodigal. Welcome back to the land of the living. How you feeling? I'm good. Of course you are. The world's your oyster. Am I right? Unencumbered young man with, uh, stacks of cash. Hey, I'm, uh-- I'm jealous. Hand to G--, I'm jealous. Yeah, speaking of cash, uh, you know what's giving me heartburn lately? Your former partner. This guy He works like a b------, right? Builds a business, single-handed. Finally, the big money shows up, and what does he do? He walks out. Talent like that, and he just flushes it down the crapper. It's like Michelangelo won't paint. [laughs.] Look, I know you're out of it and all, but you-- you wouldn't talk to him, would you? I mean, help him pull his head out of his a--? He won't listen to me, he's not gonna listen to you, all due respect. You want a job? A job? Who's got a job for me? I do. [Woman on TV.] Okay, let's see some jokers. I used to be an English teacher, so I'd better take grammar for 100. [applause.] All right. Child stars for 100. [breathing heavily.] [bell dings.] [scribbling.] [dings.] [heavy breathing continues.] [bell continues dinging.] Hi. Hey. Thought I'd, uh, well, visit, if you don't mind. No, of course not. You don't, uh You don't need the room, do you? No. I just needed some more space to spread out. Just wanted to say hello to little Holly here. Hey, girl. Hi. Oh, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. [fussing.] Oh, yeah. She is a beauty. Look at her. Hey, thanks for being so flexible on me coming in. Well, I just wish we had you back full time. You do brighten up the place. Listen, believe me, this is, uh [sighs.] I don't wanna bring this up, but I-- I can't sign off on these quarterlies. I'm sorry. I just can't. Is that right? If you're gonna do this, Ted, you can't be so glaring about it. [chuckles.] Glaring. Okay. That does sound bad. Uh, show me what's bothering you. Keller. No. Again G--, I'm sorry. I know how you feel about this. Revenue with no backup. Here, here, and here. I don't even know what to say. Yeah. Um Yeah, well, uh Okay. This is- This is fixable, right? How about if I just push, uh, 28,800, um, out of this into next quarter? Would you sign it then? I'm-- I'm just saying I can't sign it as it currently exists. Fair enough. I'll take care of it. Thank you for the heads-up. Well, you won't have to deal with this again, I swear. What if your kids found out? If my kids found out? This-- what you're doing. I mean, someday, they're gonna be old enough. How would you explain it to them? [chuckles.] Well-- Wow. Put me on the spot, why don't you? I guess maybe I'd, um-- I'd say that, uh, I might have feet of clay that-- But that whatever I did, I did thinking of them. You know? Trying to provide. And, uh, I'd ask them to try to take the time to understand [chuckles.] You know what? Truth is, I haven't thought that far ahead, Skyler. I'm just trying to keep my head above water, so I better get back to it. [door closes.] [cell phone buzzing.] [sighs.] Oh, G--. Hi, Walt. Listen. I'm-- I can't talk- I'm at work right now. What? Louis dropped him off. He was here when I got home. No, no, no. Of course. No. He's not staying. He understands that. I'll-- I'll bring him anywhere you want. Dad Well, yeah, it is rush hour. I mean, I could fight traffic and bring him down to Beneke now, but wouldn't it be easier if we Right. Okay. Good. So we'll meet you at the house. Okay. Bye. W-Why are you doing this? She's just trying to k-keep me from seeing you, and you're helping her. No. No, son. I mean, your-- your mother-- she has her reasons. What reasons? They're, uh Well, they're Well, they're just a little difficult to delineate, but-- I mean, yes, there are two sides to every story. Always. But, uh, she, uh Yeah. This is just how it has to be. For now. Okay? And, look, your home is your home, and that is where you belong, okay? But it's where you belong. Dad, it-- it's your house. Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie-- everybody knows that you hen't done anything wrong. Everybody is on your side. Well, it's-- it's-- it's not about taking sides, though. How can-- How can you let her treat you like this? Now, come on. How-- How-- How can you just-- just take it? Just listen to me, okay? No matter what, all of this has nothing to do with how we feel about you, okay? We both love you very, very much, okay? You and your sister will come first, always. Hmm? Now, come on. Let's, uh Let's try to see this in a positive light, okay? Both of us. Let's just buck up. [sighs.] Then I'll take you home. Uh, let me first just hit the old bathroom.  [hums.] [clears throat.] Hello. Good afternoon. Nice to meet you. Saul Goodman. Nice to meet you. You're not that lawyer on late-night television, are you? Better call Saul! [chuckles.] [laughing.] I get it all the time. We're here to discuss the sale of the property at 9809 Margo. I get it. Flat-fee clients. Am I right? Well, folks, today's your lucky day. I represent a client who shall remain nameless. However, for our purposes, you might just as well visualize a large bag of money. This individual wants to buy your use today, for cash. Cash? Cash. I know. In this economy. In fact, the money is already burning a hole in my client's account. You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown him all the pertinent financials. It the only reason we're sitting here. Fair enough. We, uh, get a few papers signed and notarized, we can take care of this right now. In fact, I can wire you your money this very afternoon. There's just one little hair in the soup-- uh, the price. We feel 875 is very fair. But I suppose there's always a little, uh, wiggle room. Well, you wiggle us on down to 400, and you got yourselves a deal. No, that's my offer. That's less than half price. We put almost that much into the renovations alone. Why don't we just cut the clown act and you tell us what you're willing to come up to? Well, this is a waste of time. Ridiculous. How could you possibly imagine that we would entertain this? Come on, hon. I don't know. I just thought some allowance was in order once I heard about the meth lab. The one that used to be in the basement. I looked over your signed disclosure statements, and I don't see any mention of a meth lab. No. No. Oh, you got your termite inspection. That's good. But no meth lab. Now, some would call that fraud in service of concealing a felony. I, myself, am more open-minded. But it is tricky. Don't get me wrong. I applaud your c------. I mean, good try in sneaking a meth-contaminated property past the buyer. I mean, you know, could've been a good deal for you. Too bad. Now, I uld file a suit and encumber this property indefinitely, or I could start some criminal proceedings. But I don't think any of us want that now, do we? How about it, counselor? Do you concur?  [hums.] [grunts.] Ta-da. Here you go, son. Come on. It's not Devil's Island. [grunts.] Okay. Ooh. Here we go. Oh. Hey. [chuckles.] Hello. Ah. Uh, mmm. Brought pizza. Yeah. Well, I'm making dinner. Oh, okay. I'll just, uh, put it in the fridge. It's even better the next day, huh? Hi, honey. Uh Sorry. Yeah. All right. Skyler Honey, what kind of example do we want to set here? Right? I mean, can't we at least just sit down and eat a piece of pizza together? Just to hash things out like adults? You know-- We havediscussed everything we ne to discuss. I thought I made myself very clear. I got dipping sticks. [yells, huffs.] [groaning.] [phone ringing.] [groaning continues.] [ringing continues.] [Walt on machine.] You've reached Walt's temporary number. Please leave a message. [spitting.] [beeps.] [Skyler on machine.] When I went out this morning to get the newspaper, I saw a pizza on our roof. Would you know anything about that? Listen to me, Walt. You need to control yourself. Calm down, accept the situation, and keep your distance. If you can't manage that, I will get a restraining order. [beeps.] [yells.] [groans.] Skyler. Skyler. I got your restraining order right here! Restrain this! Oh. [groans.] [groans.] Oh, yeah. [grunting.] Breaking even's not so bad. In this economy, a lot of people would kill to break even. Poor Jake. He had his heart set on going to space camp. [car approaching.] [sighs.] Oh, no. Oh, G--. This is all we need. [both sigh.] Hey, Mom, Dad. How's it going? Uh, Jesse, it's, uh, really not a good time. Jesse, the house has been sold. The new owners are expected at any moment. Where do you think you're going? Inside. I bought the place. [door closes.] Be back by 7, okay? I love you. [car door closes.] Bye. [car departs.] [engine starts.] [tool whirring.] Ahh! Jeez. [bangs.] [mutters.] [coughs.] Come on. [groans.] [grunting.] [coughing.] [spitting.] Oh, G--! [grunting.] Ahh! [coughing.] [pounding.] [grunting.] [groaning.] Oh, s---- No! [groaning.] Oh, G--. [car approaching.] [shower running.] * [Walt singing, faint.]  It was dead   You see, I've been through the desert   On a horse with no name   It felt good to get out of the rain   In the desert   You can remember your name   'Cause there ain't no one   For to give you no pain   [humming.]  La la la la   La la la   La la  * La la * * La la la la * * La la la * [mutes speaker device.] It's me. There's something you should know about. Hold on. [whispering.]  [Walt humming.]  After three days   In the desert fun   I was looking at a riverbed   The story it told   Of a river that flowed   Made me sad to think it was dead   You see, I've been through the desert   On a horse with no name   It felt good to get out of the rain   In the desert   You can remember your name   'Cause there ain't no one   For to give you no pain   La la   La la la la la   La la la   La la   [humming.]  La la la la la   La la la   [humming.] [shower off.]  You see, I've been through the desert   On a horse with no name  [phone buzzing.]  It felt good to get out of the rain   In the desert   You can remember your name   See, I've been through the desert   On a horse with no name   It felt good to get out of the rain   In the desert you can remember your name   'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain   [humming.]  [humming stops.]  [hums.]  [hums.]  [hums.]
