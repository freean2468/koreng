                    			Previously on Breaking Bad His name is Jessy dad, and you don't know the first thing about him. You're going back to rehab, today. I have a daughter. Family. Can't give up on them. - 201.6 - Better over than under. What are you? Running a charity? Maybe I know a whole new market. - Maybe all's we need is the map. - The yield, come on. Surprised he doesn't make us do that. The pack totally has a pecking order. And the head Hyena, he's the man. All the other ones have to, like, kiss his ass. I mean, literally. It's so gross. They have to lick his junk. I-I-I can't believe they even showed it on TV. Yo, if this is supposed to be all, like, Major League and all, we should have equipment maintainer guys. And water boys. You know? Yo, Gatorade me, bitch. Get us a couple flunkies in here. Treat us right. Okay, 15 hours starts now. I'm going to hit it, if that's cool with you. I don't understand. What? These numbers, they just don't add up. Told you. Dude's totally boning us. No, it's not that. It's our output. We're off. We're .14% off. Point one-four, that's what, like What does that mean? It means we should be netting more than we're netting. So how far off are we? It's not negligible. Ball-parking it, I'd say we're quarter to a half a pound shy. That's weird. What about spillage? Spillage? Yeah, you know, like, just stuff gets spilled. Nothing gets spilled. A little maybe. Nothing gets spilled. What about evaporation? It wouldn't account for this much. The materials aren't out that long. What about the other one? The drops, like on on that, like, cold beer. Condensation? Yeah. No. What about the crap that gets left behind, you know, all the gunk we scrape out of the vats? I add up, like, a gallon each. Did you work that in? Vestiges? Yeah. Vestiges. Bet that's it. Bet that's totally it. Hey, Mr. White. Mr. White. Huh? Are you okay? Yeah Yeah, why? Nothing. Are you coming? Yeah, in a minute. All right, see you tomorrow. All right. Shit. You bastard. Son of a Come on, you Come on, come on. Son of a Okay. Son of a bitch. Oh! That's great. All right. You little bastard. Shut the door! My ears are popping. Shut the door. Move. It's like I'm on an airplane, yo. What the hell's doing that? Positive pressure. Positive what? God, friggin' kills, yo. Well, just move your jaw around. Move it around. I am moving it around. It's not working. Then just yawn or something. Stop acting like such a baby. Damn. W-W-What positive? Positive what? Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up to keep the outside out. There's been a contamination. Wait. What? Whoa whoa whoa, hey, hold up. Something got into the lab. So what do we do? I mean, do we Wait. Wait. I mean, shouldn't we be wearing masks? No, no, it's not that that kind of contaminant. So it's, like, not dangerous? Mr. White, talk to me here. Not to us particularly. No. What the hell is that? This is, uh I made it. So exactly what kind of contaminant are we dealing with here? A fly. What do you mean? A fly, like like what do you mean? I mean a fly, a house fly. Like, uh, one fly? Singular? What did it do? It got into the lab, and I'm trying to get it out. Okay? Understand? No, man, not really. I can't say that I'm really following you here. Dude, you scared the shit out of me. I mean, when you say it's contamination, I mean, I'm thinking, like an Ebola leak or something. Ebola? Yeah, it's a disease on The Discovery Channel, where all your intestines sort of just slip right out of your butt. Thank you. I know wt Ebola is. Uh-huh. Now, tell me. What would a West-African virus be doing in our lab? Hmm? So you're chasing around a fly, and in your world I'm the idiot. Jesse, listen. This fly any fly cannot be in our lab. It's It's a problem. It's a contamination, and that is in no way a misuse of the word. Okay? So in terms of keeping our cook clean and our product unadulterated, we need to take this. Now do you understand? So is that your fly saber? This is a swatter. It happens to work quite well, thank you. Uh-huh. Hey, what happened to your head? Nothing. I'm fine. You didn't hit it, like really really hard? My head is not the problem, Jesse. The fly is the problem. You didn't happen to maybe try our product, did you? Jess I know this seems unusual to you, a layman. A fly I get it seems insignificant, right? But trust me. In a highly controlled environment such as this anyollutant no matter how small could completely Hello. What? Were you here all night? Have you even slept? No. Jesse, look. I'm fine. Okay. Will you just please focus Okay, look. We're running late, so let's just get started. Shall we? The sooner we do it, the sooner we're done. Frickin' finally. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? It's time to alkaline. Have you not heard a word I said? No cooking until this fly is dealt with. Have I been speaking to self? The mer went off, yo. How long is this batch going to be good for? An hour? Two? The batch will be good for nothing if we don't clear the contaminant. Clear the contaminant? We're making meth here, not space shuttles. We're making nothing until we catch this fly. What fly? Where the hell is this fly? Not like I've even seen the thing. Maybe your positive pressure blew it out the door or something. No, no. It is here. It is around. Okay? He's around, and am not going to expose this batch to the open air and contamination. Now, you can leave me to deal with this myself, or you can help me, but you are right. We are running out of time, so I need your answer right now. Okay. Hey, tick-tock. Yo. Look, I like making cherry products, but let's keep it real. All right, we make poison for people who don't care. We probably have the most UN-picky customers in the world. No, no, no, no, no. No rationalizing. We'll find it any minute now. Don't give up. Did you Did you know that there's an acceptable level of rat turds that can go into candy bars? That's the government, Jack. Even the government doesn't care that much about quality. You know what is okay to put in hotdogs? Huh? Pig lips and assholes, but I say, hey, have at it, bastard, because I love hotdogs, and, you know, see what I'm What are you doing? Oh. Hey. Look, let me just top it off, all right, really quick. A little sodium hydroxide, shut the lid, No harm done. Then we're golden. It stays closed. That's an order. You can't order shit, Adolf. We're 50-50 partners. Remember? Ow! God, what is your problem, bro? Freakin' psycho. Jesse. Oh, God, it, like, hit bone. Jesse. Jesse. You see it, right? You see it? Yeah. Get it. You want me to get it? Yes. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow. Move slowly. I know. I'm moving slowly, yeah. Absolutely. I'm just going to need your swatter thing. Yeah. Come on. Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on. Come on. Make it count. Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna I'm going to make it count, all right. Ok. Now. On three. Okay. One Ow! Yeah. You like that? Hurts, huh? Did you get it? I think so, yeah. Where is it? I don't know. It doesn't matter. Who cares? I got it. Oh, Jesus, seriously? Where is it? It's, uh, right there. Look. Look. See? I told you I got it. This is a raisin. Look, I definitely got it, man. All right Oh, man. He's got some skills, yo. I'll give him that. Look I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you, but once more I shall try. This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin our batch. Now, we need to destroy it and every trace of it so we can cook. Failing that we're dead. There is no more room for error. Not with these people. All right, how about we go get some air? Get some air? Your answer to "We're sliding head-first into a massive crap " Mister Mr. White, I understand that the fly is a serious thing. Now, all right? I'm on board. I'm just saying maybe if we went and got some air, it would help us come up with a plan on how to catch it. Then come back down here and subtract his ass. Oh, wait, do you have your keys? Yeah. You're sure? Last thing we need is to get locked out. Yeah. Hey! If you're not going to help me, stay out of my way! Hey! Yo. Yo, does somebody have an ax I can use? El ax-o! Peligroso! El ax-o! There we go. Say good night. Son of a bitch! Son of a Shit! Damn it! Where in the hell is that What the hell? Need some juice maybe? Knock yourself out. It's a real one. Yeah, like yours was working. No, no No, no Look, we're trying to decontaminate. You don't decontaminate by contaminating further. What the hell is all this? Here, how about this? "Nontoxic glue strips." Yeah, baby, it's got pheromones. I got a buttload. We hang them up all over the place. It won't be able to resist. I sure hope we have enough. I'm going to go out on a limb and say yeah. Do you see him? How long do you think you've been awake? Why do you keep asking me that? Just figure you could use some coffee, is all. I know I could. How about it? Yeah. You take cream and sugar? Black is fine. Why don't you just leave him be? Let the traps do the work. These pheromones are supposed to kick ass. I bet we catch this mo-fo any second. Thank you. You ever have, like, a wild animal trapped our house? Not that I can recall, no. We did, this one time, back when it was my aunt's house, back before she died of cancer. Possum. Big, freaky-looking bitch. Hey, since when did they change it to "opossum"? What's up with that? I mean, when I was coming up, it was just "possum." "Opossum" makes it sound like he's Irish or something. Why they gotta go changing everything? Whatever. They're just big rats anyways, giant pink-tailed rats with their pink rat faces, totally freaky, like alien rats. Actually, it's not so much that he got trapped, but he was living there under the house. You could hear him going from, like, room to room, always scurrying around. Sometimes I'd see him outside at night, and he would just, you know, freeze. And it's like you're not looking right at it. Right? I mean, it thinks it's fooling you. That's what they do. They play dead or whatever. It's just so lame. Is there a discernible point to this story, a point that you'll be arriving at sometime in the near future? It was just a total bitch to get out. It took forever. A guy came, set all these traps and all, and he finally got it, but my aunt, she didn't believe it. She kept insisting she could still hear the thing. I mean, you could not tell her any different. She started keeping an old umbrella by her chair. Man, she would just bang on the floor and yell at it, even gave it a name. It was, uh, Sc Scrabble. Yeah, that was it. "Scrabble, just knock it off." Bang, bang, bang. She got like that toward the end. Got obsessive about stuff, just got mad about stuff. We didn't know what was up. It wasn't like her to be that way. But it turned out that the the cancer had spread to her brain, and that was why. It metastasized. But it was good that that was when we decided to take her to the doctor because then we knew what was up and got her some treatment and meds so she wasn't stressing all the time. It was a lot better after that. She was a lot happier. Where the hell is he? I've been to my oncologist, Jesse, just last week. I'm still in remission. I'm healthy. Okay, so good. Great. Well, no end in sight. Well, I missed it. There was some perfect moment, and it passed me right by. Yeah, I had to have enough to leave them. That was the whole point. None of this makes any sense if I didn't have enough. But it had to be before she found out Skyler. It had to be before that. Perfect moment For what? To drop dead? What, are you saying you want to die? I'm saying I've lived too long. You want them to actually miss you. You know? You want their memories of you to be But she just won't understand. She just No matter how well I explain it, these days she just has this this I mean, I truly believe there exists some combination of words. There must exist certain words in a certain, specific order that would explain all of this, but with her I just I just can't ever seem to find them. Mr. White, how about you just sit down? I was thinking maybe before the fugue state, but before the fugue state they didn't have enough money, so no, not then. And plus my daughter wasn't born yet. It had to be Afr Holly was born. Mr. White Definitely before the surgery. Oh, Christ. That damn second cell one. How could I possibly Ah, I know the moment. It was the night Jane died. And we needed diapers, and so I said I'd go, but it was just an excuse. Actually, that was the night I I brought you your money, remember? Yeah, I remember. But afterward I stopped at a bar. It was odd. I never do that, go to a bar alone. I just walked in, sat down. I never told you. That you went to a bar? I sit down, and this man, this stranger, he engages me in conversation. Now, he's a complete stranger. But he turns out to be Jane's father, Donald Margolis. What are you talking about? Of course I didn't know it at the time. I mean, it was just some guy in a bar. Didn't put it together until after the crash when he was all over the news. Jane's dad. I mean, think of the odds. Once I tried to calculate them, but they're astronomical. I mean, think of the odds of me going in, sitting down that night in that bar next to that man. What did you talk about? Oh, water on Mars. Family. What about family? I told him that I had a daughter, and he told me he had one, too. Then he said, "Never give up on family." And I didn't. I I took his advice. The universe is random. It's not inevitable. It's simple chaos. It's subatomic particles in endless, aimless collision. That's what science teaches us, but what is this saying? What is it telling us, when on the very night that this man's daughter dies, it's me who's having a drink with him? How can that be random? Hey, listen, Mr. White. Hey Hey, sit down. No No. No, it's Oh. Oh. No, that that was the moment. That night. I should never have left home. Never gone to your house. Maybe things would have Oh, thought I was I was at home watching TV. Some Some nature program about elephants. Skyler and Holly were in another room. I could hear them on the baby monitor. She was singing a lullaby. Ah If had just lived right up to that moment and not one second more that would've been perfect. He's not coming down. Must be Thailand-hot up there. That's why he likes it. Thailand's hot, right? Yeah. See? That's why. Oh, Jesus. Hey, wait. Here. He's not coming down. He's staying up there forever. What are you What are you doing? What do you think? I'm going to get that bitch. Uh No, you're going to break your neck. Yeah, yeah. Just No, seriously, you're This is a bad idea. Damn it. Jesse. Just hold onto it. Hold it still? Jesse. I'm sorry. Sorry for what? Being a lunatic? I'm sorry about Jane. Yeah. Me, too. No, I mean, uh I'm very sorry. It's not your fault. But it's not mine either. It's no one's fault, not even hers. Sucker's just sitting there. We are who we are, Mr. White. You know, just two junkies with a duffel bag full of cash. Like you said, we both would've been dead within a week. But I miss her, though. God, I do. Jesse, come down. Wait, I am so close. Let it go. We need to cook. What about the contamination? It's all contaminated. I definitely scared him. Probably stay out of our way God. Yeah! Zap! Somebody got got, yo! You see that, Mister Bins are packed? Bins are packed. How's the yield? Two-oh-two and change. You okay getting home? Yeah. Better. Thanks. MaÃ±ana, then. Jesse, come here. I couldn't chance saying it inside. For all I know, the lab's wired for sound. That half a pound that I said we're off by Now, I'm not accusing you, but if You understand? And if they ever found out I didn't take shit. I'm just saying that I won't be able to protect you. Who's asking you to?
