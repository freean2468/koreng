                    			[lighter clicks.] [butane hissing.] [straining.] [screaming.] [screaming continues.] He's still breathing. By the looks of him, he has no idea how close he came. I'm assuming Saul Goodman doesn't need to know. Mum's the word. [engine starts.] [recording playing.] * Old MacDonald had a farm * * E-I-E-I-O * [humming along.]  And on his farm he had a duck   E-I-E-I-O   With a hmm-hmm here   And a quack-quack there   Here an oink, there a oink   Everywhere an oink-oink   Old MacDonald had a farm   E-I-E-I-O  * [continues.] Son of a bitch. * [stops.] Hang on, baby. [beeping.] [line ringing.] [Walt.] Hello. Walt, are you in the house? Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me. What-- What the hell are you doing in there? I'm back. No. No, you're not back. Walt, you're not back. Get-- Get-- Get out of there. Well, it's-- it's my house, too, Skyler. I'm staying. End of story. [sighs.] We had an agreement. I didn't agree to anything. No. No. There's nothing to talk about. I am not coming in there until you get out. Well suit yourself. Walt. Walt? What is wrong with you? Skyler, I have every right to be here. No, you don't. You don't live here anymore. We're getting a divorce. I don't agree to a divorce. It's not up to you. If you don't get out of here right now, I'm going to call the police and I'm going to tell them everything. I mean it, Walt. There's the phone. [dialing.] [fretting.] [crying.] [line ringing.] It's ringing. [Woman.] Albuquerque Police Department, Operator #314B. How may I help you? Yes, I-- I want to report a disturbance, please. No, no, it's not- it's not exactly-- It's, um It's a domestic issue. Okay. They're connecting me. Right hand to God, I will tell them. Do what you have to do, Skyler. This family is everything to me. Without it, I have nothing to lose. Fine. Yes, my name is Skyler White. I need police assistance at my home right away. My-- soon-to-be ex-husband broke into my house, and I need an officer to come and remove him. It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane. Okay. Okay. [baby fussing.] Thank you. [pho beeps.] They're coming. [car door slams.] Oh Dad's here? Hey. Dad. Hey, son, come here. [chuckles.] How are you? Are-- Are you back for good? Why-- Why are you home so soon? I-- I'm not. Ah. Hey, I am starving. How about a grilled cheese? Yeah, sure. You want one, too? Walter, your dad and I have something we need to discuss. When your sandwich is ready, I'll bring it to your- to your room. Mom, can't it wait? I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever. Walter-- Ooh. [chuckling.] Mmm. [chuckles.] Mmm. So are you gonna be at work tomorrow? Yeah, that's the plan. [doorbell chimes.] Hello, ma'am. We were called about a disturbance? It's more of a trespassing situation, really, but-- Yeah, that was me. You called the cops on Dad? I, uh-- I came home from work, and he was back. He just moved back into the house. And I asked him to leave, but he won't listen. I just-- I-- I want him out. I want him out of the house. Okay, Mrs. White. There's a couple of questions I need to ask you right off of the bat. It's very important that you answer them honestly. Did he strike you? No. Has he ever hit you? No. This is not about violence. This is about trespassing, about him being here against my will. Okay. Trespassing. You're divorced, then? No, working on it. [stammering.] Right now we're separated. Legally separated? Well, there's not a court order, if that's what you mean, but we've been living apart for almost two weeks, give or take-- I changed the locks. Isn't that breaking and entering? Whose name is on the title to the house? Both of us. It's jointly owned. We can't arrest a man for breaking into his own house, not without a court order requiring he stays away from the premises, unless he's threatened you or the kids in any way. [baby fussing.] No, not-- not physically, but having him in the house is just-- It's not a good thing. Excuse me. Don't cry. Daddy's here. I got her, honey. Oh, come here. There we go. You hungry? You hungry? Here we go. Oh, that was it. I'm sorry, Officer. Where were we? [Officer.] Disagreements. Yeah, so we've had our share of that. Um, I-- I haven't I haven't been the most attentive husband lately. Mrs. White, would this be easier if we stepped outside for a minute? No. No. I'm fine right here. I'm gonna level with you, ma'am. If you want your husband out of the house, you're gonna have to help me out. Is it possible maybe he's broken any laws that you know of? Anything at all. Anything that we can work with here, just tell me. Even if you've just got a suspicion of wrongdoing, I can work with that. I'll get him out of the house for you. [Officer.] What's your take on all this? It-- It's my mom's fault. I-- and it's because he didn't do anything. I don't know whyshe's b. My-- My dad-- [baby cries.] he is a great guy. Mrs. White? I'm sorry, ma'am. There's no legal basis for us to remove your husband from the house. Next time you feel like things are getting out of control, you should call this number. It's the family hotline. I'd really look into some counseling. Best of luck to you folks. Listen, thank you, officers. We're sorry. Why do you got to-- Why do you got to do this to Dad? Junior. Wait. Come on. Don't blame your mother for this. Sorry. Ah, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. [fretting.] Welcome home. [phone beeping.] [doorbell chimes.] [knocking.] [knocking.] [sigh.] He lives! Happy housewarming, kid. Don't look so glad to see me. Thanks. Interesting decor. It's, uh, subtle. The whole minimalist thing never really blew my hair back, but hey. So, how are you doing? You staying clean? Good. I was kind of worried that you were back to old habits, since I didn't hear from you, you know? Realize how stupid it is to ignore your counsel's phone calls? What if I was trying to warn you that the DEA was going to kick down your door? I mean, what then, huh? Why don't you spare me the sermon and get to why you're here? Fair enough. Remember the other day when I brought up the idea of you getting back in touch with your, uh, partner? Well, I kind of wanted to refloat that boat. I'm not suggesting that you yourself get back to cooking, I mean, you being in rehab and all. I only want you to convince the master chef to do his thing, so what do you say? Sure, man. Whatever. Okay. Whatever what? I mean, you going to call him? I said I'll handle it. Now bounce, will you? Please? Final thought. Look at this place. You're house poor. You got no bankroll. If you get the maestro cooking again, I'll make it worth your while. [exhales.] Call him. [sigh.] [beeping.] [Jane.] Hey, if you're trying to sell me something, I've got four little words for you-- do not call list. However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep. [sigh.] [phone rings.] Schrader. Yes, sir? Yeah, what's up? Yeah? Wow! That's great news, sir. Thank you. Ah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. You can bet on that. [chuckles.] Hey, listen, thanks again, sir. I really appreciate you stepping to the plate. Thank you. You going to keep me in suspense or what? What's the good news? Merkert called in a couple of favors. El Paso wants me back. Aaah! Hey, man, congrats, man. That's fantastic. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. [engine starts.] Hello. [Man speaking Spanish.] [bell dings.] [speaking Spanish.] [beeping.] Hey, if you're trying to sell me something, I've got four little words for you-- do not call list. However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep. [beeping.] Hey, if you're trying to sell me something, I've got four little words for you-- do not call list. However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep. [phone beeping.] Hey, if you're trying to sell me something, I've got four little words for you-- Mmm. [siren approaching.] [baby cries.] Oh, sweetheart. Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay, my girl. Oh, yes. It's okay. It's okay. Mama's got you. Oh, Mama's got you, yeah. Yes. Oh. [knocking.] Skyler, want some help? Skyler, can I use the bathroom? G--. [urinating.] [Pamela.] What do you mean? Against your will? [Skyler.] Yes. Very much against my will. He just-- He- He showed right back up, and he-- he doesn't want a divorce. Won't even consider it. I-- I called the police on him. I-- I was-- I was so clo-- So close to what? Nothing. Never mind. Skyler, I can't advise you properly if you don't give me all the facts. Understand I am bound by the attorney-client privilege to keep everything you tell me a secret. I can't tell a soul unless you authorize me to. Even if it's something illegal? Especially if it's illegal. I'm your lawyer, not the police. My job is to protect you. My husband makes meth. Methamphetamine. Your husband's a drug dealer. A manufacturer. Technically, they, uh, they-- they call them cooks. I looked it up on the Internet. This is my advice, and you should take it. Sue your husband for divorce immediately. Let me go to the police and tell them what you've just told me. I'll go in ex parte and get a restraining order from the court today. If he comes anywhere near you and your children, he goes straight to jail, no questions asked. This is a no-brainer. It's the best thing for you and your family. I can't. I can't do it. I don't want my son to find out that his father is a criminal. I just-- I can't do that to him. In the end, it may not be up to you. Drug dealers have a way of getting caught. Walt has lung cancer. His treatment bought him some time, but the doctors, they all say that sooner or later-- But I can't see why I should lay all this on my family whenthings may-- resolve themselves on their own without anyone else knowing. Man, did I lose a bet or something? What are we doing in this shithole? Just relax, will you? Relax? This is the kind of place you get knifed. We should have went to Chili's, man. All right, already. J----. Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late. They got that Blooming Onion. What's wrong with spicing things up a little bit, huh? This spice looks like it's been through a couple of guys already. So when are you headed back down to El Paso? Uh, you know, between the packing and errands and, uh, getting my ducks in a row, maybe, um, a week or two. A week or two? Come on, man. I'd be dying to get back in the action. Yeah, well, it's not like there's nothing going on up here. What are you talking about? There ain't jack going on up here. It's quiet as hell. I'm going to hit the head. Those two over there. I think they're holding. Man, in this place, the bartender's probably holding. All right. Whoa. What are you doing? Calling APD. What do you think? Since when can't we handle a couple of dirtballs? Come on, man. Courtesy call. What if Vice is running some kind if undercover op? Screw it. It's your turn to pay. Where are you going? I have to take a leak. J----, get yourself some Flomax. Stand up. Do you got a problem with us, bitch? Your move. DEA! Don't move. Go tell my partner to get his ass in here. [beeping.] Hey, if you're trying to sell me something, I've got four little words for you-- do not call list. However, if you're cool, leave it at the beep. [beeping.] Hey, if you're trying to sell me something, I've got four little words for you-- do not call-- [beeping.] [tone.] We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. [car horn beeps.] [door opens, closes.] [car door slams.] Come on. Skyler. Can we talk? ASAC wants to see you. And? We're hanging back. Saw a deal go down. I went outside to call it in. You stayed to keep an eye on the suspects. That's when they attacked you. What I didn't tell them is that you left your gun under the seat before you went back inside. I've done a terrible thing, but I did it for a good reason. I did it for us. That is college tuition for Walter Junior and Holly, Huh? Then it's health insurance for you and the kids, for Junior's physical therapy, his SAT tutor. It's money for groceries and gas, for birthdays and graduation parties. Skyler, that money is for this roof over your head, the mortgage that you are not going to be able to afford on a part-time bookkeeper's salary when I'm gone. Walt, I-- Please. Please. This money I didn't steal it. it doesn't belong to anyone else. I earned it. The things I've done to earn it the the things I've hato do, I've got to live with them. Skyler. All that I've done, all the sacrifices that I have made for this family, all of that will be for nothing if you don't accept what I've earned. Please. I'll be here when you get home from work. You can give me your answer then. Hey, Sky. Hi. Ahem. Uh, some coffee? Yeah. That report's looking real good. That-- I like how it looks. Good. Are your kids home? Ahem. [helicopter.] Ooh! Ooh! Ooh, it's here, it's here! [TV continues.] Hello, Mrs. White. Oh. Hi, Louis. Hey, uh, thanks for having me over for dinner. Um, sure. Hey, Skyler. I'm, uh, cooking dinner. Pot roast. Uh, could you-- So how was your day? Good. Good. Excellent. I hope you don't mind. I invited Louis to stay for dinner tonight, you know, as a thank you for driving Walter Junior to school for us. We've been kind of absent, but I tell you, Louis really pitched in. Um [Walter Junior, Louis laugh.] Look, I just want to say that I-- I feel good about our talk this morning, and I'm-- I'm very eager to hear what you're thinking about-- about what we talked about. But, you know, whenever you're ready, of course. Yeah. Hmm. Honesty is good. Don't you think? There. I fucked Ted. Boys, dinner. [Walter Junior, Louis chatter.] Thank you. Louis? Uh, yes, please. All right. Thank you. I want you boys both to eat your salad, okay? Okay. I know. Nobody likes salad, but it's good for you. Thanks, darling. Thank you.
