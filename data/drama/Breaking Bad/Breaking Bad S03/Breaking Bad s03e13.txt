Full Measure



                    			[knock on door.] Well, hello again. [Skyler.] Hi! I hope we're not too late. No, no. Perfect timing. Okay, Stan, this is my husband Walt. Hi. Good to meet you, Walt. Nice to meet you. Sandia Laboratories, huh? Yeah. I hear some pretty fascinating stuff goes on out there. Ah, well, you know-- [both chuckle.] Working on anything you can talk about? [groans.] I'm picturing giant space lasers. Am I right? Honestly, what I do would bore you senseless. Oh! But giant space lasers? Now, that sounds cool. I'll have to bring it up at our next staff meeting. Well, just remember I get a cut. [chuckles.] All right, that's a deal. So this is it, honey. What do you say? Do you want to take a tour? Sure. Okay. Look, how about I give y'all some privacy? I'll go out to the car and make a few calls. Take as much time as you need. All right. Good. Okay. Thanks. He's actually a nice guy. He doesn't push. Yeah. So, as you can see, there's, uh there's a kind of flow going on here. It's a nice big living room. Yeah. And this is the dining area. Ah, the dining area. Right. Yes. Oh, and, uh-- [singsong.] It's got a pool. Oh, pool is nice. Mm-hmm. Backyard could be a little bigger. Um, and-- Oh, there's a breakfast bar kind of dealie here which is nice. Jesus. And, uh, I don't know, the kitchen's really spacious and, you know, got good appliances, and-- How many bedrooms? Three. Told you. There'll all pretty good size, and-- Oh, this is the first one here. And then there's two more at the back. Only three bedrooms? I think we're gonna need at least five. Don't you think? Five? Yeah. What? Do I look like I'm about to drop a litter? No, no, no, no, no, no. Dude. No, we'll have three kids total, eventually. But we'll need a spare room for a study so that I could work at home and you can write. Nah, I don't-- I don't think this is gonna be enough. Okay. Um, what about a wine cellar? I mean, we certainly cannot be expected to live without a wine cellar. Very funny. Mmm. I just think we need to set our sights high is all. At least higher than here. Walt, this is a good neighborhood. It's got a good elementary and supposedly a very good high school. And believe me-- 'cause I have definitely looked everywhere-- for our price range, this is as good as it gets. Well, then let's stretch our price range. [scoffs.] Truly. I mean, why buy a starter house when we'll have to move out in a year or two? Did you win the lottery and not tell me? I'm serious. [chuckles.] Come on. Why be cautious? We've got nowhere to go but up. [exhales.] [sighs.] [ringtone.] Yeah. [Man.] Walter, you see us? Yeah, I see you. I'd like you to exit your vehicle and start walking toward us. And then what? I'm gonna need some some kind of assurance. I assure you I could kill you from way over here, if it makes you feel any better. ["door open" bell dinging.] Walter, you've been busy. You want to put your arms out to the sides for me, if you would? You know I haven't slept since Thursday? I was out all night cleaning up after you. I need my sleep. You said no half measures. Yeah. Funny how words can be so open to interpretation. You get your car fixed? Not yet. You're gonna want to get your car fixed. Let's see how this goes first. Has your condition worsened? Excuse me? Your medical condition, has it grown worse? Not that I know of, no. Is there a ringing in your ears? No. Are you seeing bright lights or hearing voices? I'm quite well, thank you. No. Clearly you are not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself. My partner was about to get himself shot. I intervened. Some worthless junkie-- For him you intervene and put us all at risk? Some contemptible junkie who couldn't keep the peace for eight hours? That's right. He couldn't. He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an 11-year-old boy. I heard about it. He should have let me take care of them. Maybe. Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order. Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child? I would never ask you that. Where is Pinkman now? I wouldn't know. A couple of time zones away, at least. Beyond that, I'd only be guessing. He has enough money to last forever. He knows he needs to keep moving. You'll never find him. I don't know, Walt. It's what I do, after all. He's out of the picture. I saved his life. I owed him that. But now he and I are done, which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it? [inhales.] [exhales.] You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man, so if I may, I would like to review options with you of which it seems to me you have two. Option A-- you kill me right here and now. Apparently, I have made that very easy for you. You can kill me-- no witnesses-- and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman, and you kill him too. A pointless exercise, it seems to me. But that is Option A. What is Option B? I continue cooking. You and I both forget about Pinkman. We forget this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer Option B. You'd need a new assistant. I could get right on that. No. This time, I choose. Your car. Get it fixed. Yeah. [handle rattling, keys jingle.] Really? It's good to see you. Thanks. It's good to be back. Well, shall we? By all means, Gale, let's cook. [Mike.] What about that rhinoceros? You think he'd make a good pet? No. No? Don't you think if you called to him, he'd come running for his supper? I'll bet he would. I bet he'd come running. [vocalizes.] You're silly, Pop Pop. Well, a little. But he'd probably knock everything over. Plus, there's that big nose of his. That's not a nose. That's a horn. Is that so? His real nose is little. Huh. I learn all kinds of things being with you. Okay, June Bug, these are for you. What about the rest? The rest are for me. No, they're not. You're too old for balloons. Oh, you're never too old for balloons. Give me a hug. Oh, I see your mama. Don't keep her waiting. Bye, Pop Pop. Bye, baby. [electricity crackles.] [speaks Spanish.] [speaks Spanish.] [speaking Spanish.] [silenced gunshots.] [gasp.] [speaks Mandarin.] Please. Please, no. [speaking Mandarin.] [screaming.] Chow, do you have anything you want to tell me? Thank God you're here. They keep me prisoner. They keep you prisoner. I don't do nothing for them ever. They try and make me. I say no. They steal my chemicals. I can't stop them. I am businessman. You're a businessman-- The lady out front-- Hey, lady, are you still there? Ask her if she's still there. [speaks Mandarin.] [Woman speaking Mandarin.] [speaking continues.] She says yes. [sighs.] How's her driving? Driving. Is she good behind the wheel? Good. She's good driver. Licensed? Dependable? She has a Camry. Good. [grunts.] [whimpering.] The trucks will be here first thing in the morning. I strongly recommend that you return our calls next time. So have her drive you to the hospital. [whimpering.] She's gonna need her shoe. Where did they cross? Laredo, looks like. They didn't exactly send their A players. But like you said, it's cartel, all right. Probing for weakness. Hmm. Well, they didn't find any. What about Pinkman? [sighs.] I'm making inquiries. [door closes.] [liquid bubbling.] Done. That's two? All right. Let's close it up. Bring it down. Ready? [switch clicks.] [machinery whirs.] Great. Okay. We're good. You can take your mask off now. [clatter.] [Gale.] Does that guy ever leave? Nah. When exactly did that start? It's new. We had a We had a little drama with the person you replaced. I'm sorry to hear that. No, it'll be fine. Things will continue to smooth out, and, yeah, it'll be fine. By the way, if you're at all worried about working with me-- Mo, I'm not. Because whatever my shortcomings last time, I intend for things to go perfectly from here on out. So, if there is-- Gale, you're great. Seriously. I just-- However you like things to be done is exactly how we are gonna do them. Period. From here on out. So, uh please teach me. [chuckles.] Okay.  ["Crapa Pelada".] [singing along with recording.]  A voi, miei signori   Io voglio narrare   La storia che tanto mi fa disperare   Con ciocche sebenti che vedo cadere   Dal capo i capelli bianchi   Ormai son pelato, deluso, avvilito   Non so quali cure adottar   Ma senti cosa dice   Quel povero infelice   Non ti lamentar   Ma prova a cantar   Con noi questa canzon   [tempo increases.]  Crapa Pelada la fÃ  i turtei   Ghe ne dÃ  minga ai sui fradei   Oh, oh, oh, oh   I s fradei fan la fritada   Ghe ne dan minga a Crapa Pelada   Oh, oh, oh, oh   Crapa Pelada la fÃ  i turtei   Ghe ne dÃ  minga ai s fradei   I s fradei fan la fritada   Ghe ne dan minga a Crapa Pelada   Crapa Pelada la fÃ  i turtei   Ghe ne dÃ  minga ai s fradei   Oh, oh, oh, oh  [knock on door.]  [continues.] [knocking continues.] [stereo off.] Gale. It's good to see you. Mr. Fring. Wow. This is, uh-- I should have called first. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? No. No, not at all. Please come in. Can I offer you something? CrÃ¨me de Menthe? Oh, no. No, thank you. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience. I need to talk to you about something something rather pressing. If push came to shove, I was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself. You and an assistant. Why would-- Why would push come to shove? Has Walter ever talked to you about why he got into this particular line of work? Uh I guess I assumed it was because it pays so well. Oh, it is, but specifically. Has he ever spoken to you about his health problems? Oh. I'm not surprised. He's a very private person. What exactly are his health problems? He's dying of cancer. It is why he does this, to provide for his family, which he has accomplished. They will never want for anything. He's seen to that. Well how long does he have? That is very much the question. He does not want to talk about it, and every time I bring it up with him-- Hmm. I don't know that he's fully accepted the reality of it. And not to sound cold-blooded, but I am running a business here. No, I-- I understand. I have a very large investment in this. There is so much overhead that I can't afford to shut down, not even for a week. So you understand my concern and my desire for continuity? I do, absolutely. Now, I intend to keep Walter on as long as he wants, assuming he's physically up to it. But as he cannot or will not tell me how long that might be, I must prepare for the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario. Uh I suppose if we had at least a few more cooks together You don't think you're ready now? Well, he is such a a master. There's always more for me to learn. But I'm thinking that if we had say, one or two more cooks? One more I guess, would do it. I suppose. I believe in you, Gale. I know that when the time comes, you will be ready. What's up? Walt? Hmm. Is there, um any particular trick to purging the catalyst bed? No, it's pretty straightforward. I'll show you when we get there. [sighs.] [beeps.] Yeah. Tell him I'm in conference. [beeps.] Can't you see I'm in conference? I'm looking to find a client of yours. I was hoping you could help me out with an address. Which client? Jesse Pinkman. Jesse Pinkman in the phone book Jesse Pinkman. Hmm. How would one track him down? I wonder. [switch clicks.] You're still here. I need your full attention, Saul. Jesse Pinkman current whereabouts. The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to whatever the hell this is exactly. What am I, eight-grade hall monitor? "Current whereabouts." Let me tell you something, Mike-- Whoa. You are good right there. Now, let's both get comfortable. Now, when I say I'm looking for Pinkman, we both know why, don't we? And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me. [stammering.] Mike, uh, there are rules to this lawyer thing. Is that right? [laughs.] Yeah. Attorney-client privilege. That's a big one. And that's something I provide for you. So if I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking "Old Saul gives 'em up pretty easy. What's to keep him from giving me up?" You see? So then where's the trust? I trust the hole in the desert I'd leave you in. Yeah, it's an argument. So don't make me beat you till your legs don't work. Now tell me where to find him. You know it's the right thing. I can't tell you, Mike. All right, I-- Look, if I was to tell you, I just-- I couldn't live with myself. I'm sorry. Hmm. [gasps.] But who's to say I didn't write the address down in my day planner? Or on a scratch piece of paper somewhere? Who's to say I didn't write down a location strictly for my own professional use? Do not touch anything on my desk. I'm gonna leave the room, make myself a NescafÃ©. [door opens.] [door closes.] I'm just looking out for you, that's all. Like a mother hen. [chuckles.] Believe me, money laundering ain't what it used to be. God, do I miss the '80s. Wasting your time. I'm buying the car wash. End of story. Well, one look at this place, you're gonna fall in love, so-- [coughs.] Huh? Was I right? Where else are you gonna find a cash-only business that's this much fun? Unless we're talking massage parlors, and I don't see it. Shall we? You ever actually play laser tag? It's good cardio. Plus you get to shoot at kids. [chuckles.] [games beeping.] You got your bumper cars over there down that way. Got your arcade right here. All the latest video games. Snack bar is over there. Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents. That's a whole new revenue stream. All right, enough. We're good. [chuckles.] Holy Christ. We're good? This constitutes good where you're from? My car is bugged. I said maybe-- maybe-- I'm being followed. What the hell have you gotten me into? My very own P.I. is threatening to break my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum threatening that little prissy guy with the mustache. Over and above. Service-wise, is is over and above. You and I survive this, oh, I'm seriously rethinking my pricing. Yeah. And that goes double for you, Hip-Hop. My guy's no dummy. Right? So I give us maybe 24 hours before he figures out that address goes nowhere. You guys do your thing. Make it snappy. I'll go see if they have Tetris or something. How are you holding up? [groans.] You? I got my old job back. At least until they kill me and Gale takes over. He's their boy, huh? He's their boy. How long you think you've got? Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process. I try to be as vague as possible, but I got that guy Victor watching me, listening to every word I say. Maybe the only thing that's saving me is Gale's fastidiousness. Once he feels confident that he knows my entire method So what do we do? You know what we do. There's got to be some other way. Maybe it's better for you to just go to the cops. All right? I mean, I can't believe I'm saying that at all, but for your family? The DEA would love you. All the shit you could tell them? Federal Witness Protection, that's a good deal. As for me, I'll hit the road, yo. I mean-- I'll make it. We had a-- We had a good run. But it's over. Never the DEA. The cook can't stop. That's the one thing I'm certain of. Production cannot stop. Gus can't afford to. So if I'm the only chemist that he's got, then I've got leverage. And leverage keeps me alive. It keeps you alive, too. I think I can see to that. If I'm the only chemist that he's got. I-- I can't do it, Mr. White. Like you said, I'm-- I'm not a I can't do it. I'll do it. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna need your help. I mean, they're watching me day and night. They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment. Hell, I don't even know where the man lives. He's not in the phone book. I can't find him on the Internet. I can't do it in the lab. Victor's always there. But if I could just shake Victor for even an hour one night, I think then that I may be able to make it look like an accident. There's got to be some other way. I'm all ears. But when it comes down to you and me versus him-- I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry-- but it's gonna be him. You are the only edge that I've got, as long as they don't know that you're in town. But I need you to track him. Get me his address, and I'll do the rest. Look, I saved your life, Jesse. Are you gonna save mine? [Jesse.] Yeah. Please tell me you found him. 6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard, Apartment 6. You there? Uh, yeah. Number 6. Got it. He's home? Yep. Anyone watching the place? No. Looks pretty much wide open. When are you gonna do it? Tonight. Once it gets dark. [sighs.] Don't do this, Mr. White. Please. Go to the cops. [door opens.] [door closes.] [vehicle approaching.] We got a problem. Some kind of chemical leaking in your lab. You gotta come with me. I'll, uh-- I'll follow you. They tell me to bring you, I bring you. Come on, get in the car. [motor whirring.] [machine whirring in distance.] [whirring stops.] I don't know if it's a barrel leak or what, but you got something mighty stinky down there. After you. Walter, the sooner you figure out what this is, the sooner we all go home. Please don't do this. Mike you don't have to do this. Yeah. Unfortunately, I do, Walter. Downstairs. I'll cook-- I'll cook for free. And there won't be any more trouble. I promise you. Okay, if I could just talk to Gus, I know I can make him understand. If I can talk to Gus-- No. Walter? I can convince him, okay? Just let me, please-- Please. Please let me talk to him! Shut up! Shut up. I can't do it. I'm sorry. I'll give you Jesse Pinkman. Okay? Like you said, he's the problem. He's always been the problem. Without him, we would-- And he's-- he's in town, all right? He's not in Virginia or wherever the hell you're looking for him. He's right here in Albuquerque, and I can take you to him. I'll take you right to him. Huh? What do you say? Where is he? Right now. You give me an address. I-- I don't-- He moves. He moves around, but if you let me call him-- No, no, please. No, I just-- My phone. I'll just-- It's just my phone. I'll call him, and I'll have him meet me. All right? Okay? Okay? [lighter clicking.] [cell phone buzzing.] Did you do it? Mr. White? Did you do it? No, I didn't do it. I can't now. It's gonna have to be you. What? No way, man. Listen to me. You're closer than we are. You'll have about a 20-minute lead. They've got me at the laundry, and they're going to kill me. Jesse, do it now! Do it-- Do it fast! Do it now! Jesse! Oh, my God. Huh. Just what the hell was that exactly? You might want to hold off. Yeah? Why? Because your boss is gonna need me. Yeah. [dialing.] [kettle whistling.]  [exotic on stereo.] [whistling continues.]  [continues.] [knocking on door.] [buzzing.]  [stops.] Hi. How can I help you? [stammering.] Take whatever you want. I have money. I have-- [stammering.] I got a lot of money. I have-- Um You-- Please don't do this. [panting.] You don't-- You-- You-- You don't have to do this. [gunshot.]
