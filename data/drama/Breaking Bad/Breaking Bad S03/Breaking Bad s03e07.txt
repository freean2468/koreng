                    			[boy laughing.] [boy laughs.] [phone rings.] [ring.] [ring.] Mmm. [whistles.] [screams.] [screaming continues.] [gasping.] [sigh.] [vehicle approaches.] Hey, you got nothing on me, yo. All right, you can call my lawyer, Saul Goodman. Talk to my lawyer, all right? Hey, you hear me. I got nothing to say. I told you. You can call my-- Ah, Christ! God! You had my cell phone number! You had my wife's name! How'd you do it? Huh? Who you working with? [grunts.] If you're, uh, ready to talk, they want to get a statement. Your side of what happened here. Or we can hold him off till another time. Maybe you'll want to talk to a lawyer. There it is. [chuckles.] Yo, Adrian. Rocky called. He wants his face back. [chuckles.] Come on. I got to cheer you up. You see that? That's your Get Out of Jail Free card. You understand Get Out of Jail Free card, right? I mean, just blink once if you're following. [chuckles.] The D.A.'s worst nightmare is that face out in public. They're going to have to steer a wide berth of young Master Pinkman for fear of the P.R. poop storm that will rain down on them if this story ever gets out. I mean, this-- this beating? Best thing for you. You're home free. Good, right? Right. Oh, my God. You're now officially the cute one of the group. Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul. This is-- I-- Jesse, I'm-- I am so sorry for this. This should not have happened. But it did. No thanks to you. But the plan did work. We would have been locked up right now if we didn't lure him away. But this-- this-- I just-- I never saw this coming. So What, uh W-what happens now? [Jesse.] What happens now? I'll tell you what happens now. Yo scumbag brother-in-law is finished, done. You understand? I will own him when this is over. Every cent he earns, every cent his wife earns, is mine. Anyplace he goes, anywhere he turns, I'm going to be there, grabbing my share. He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana for pennies, and I'll be standing over him to get my cut. He'll see me when he wakes up in the morning and when he crawls to sleep in whatever rat hole's left for him after I shred his house down, I will haunt his crusty ass forever until the day he sticks a gun up his mouth and pulls the trigger just to get me out of his head. That's what happens next. Uh, my advice-- [chuckles.] that's probably not a good strategy. I mean, they're scared of you right now. They want nothing to do with you. But if you hit them, they're forced to hit back hard. I mean, they will turn over every rock hither, thither, and yon until someone spills the beans on you and anyone associated with you, uh, present company included. Yeah, I think what Saul is saying makes a lot of sense. Jesse, move on with your life. Leave it behind, all of it. Nothing changes. Once I walk out of here, I get myself a new RV and go start cooking again. How exactly do you think you're going to get away with that? They will catch you. So what? What? I have a Get Out of Jail Free card. Hey, I may have overstated the, uh, power of your face. Not this. If the cops catch me I give them what they want the most. You. They nab me, I make a deal to give up the great Heisenberg and his million-dollar drug ring. You're my free pass, bitch. [Saul.] You're so sure. Look, if he didn't give up my name while Hank was beating him senseless, he's never going to talk. What do you think that was in there, a bluff? He wants your brother-in-law. And there's going to be a parade of lawyers creaming their Underoos for a case like that. I mean, I'd take it myself if it wouldn't cause so much collateral damage. And him cooking again. Hey, when, not if, he gets caught, and he's facing 20 years, what'll he do then? Believe me, there's no honor among thieves. Except for us, of course. No, he'll-- he'll come around. And if he doesn't, there may come a time to talk options. Options? I'm convinced that Mr. Pinkman was involved in the manufacture and distribution of phenyl-2 methamphetamine, specifically what we're calling the blue meth. I tracked him to a scrap yard where he stored an early '80s camper, an RV. While waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle, which I believed to be a rolling meth lab, I received a telephone call telling me my wife Marie had been injured in an accident. Upon hearing the news, I left Mr. Pinkman and his vehicle to tend to my wife. After arriving at the hospital, I learned the emergency call was a hoax. My wife, fortunately, was unharmed. [clears throat.] So I immediately went back to the salvage yard, but the RV was gone. Most likely destroyed on site. And it was at this point that you drove to the home of Jesse Pinkman? [whispering.] I think we're done here. Agent Schrader needs to get home, get some rest. That's fine. But just to confirm, you're taking the Fifth here? Yeah. That's correct. Okay. Well, we just want to GI you all a heads up. Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges in this matter. He's given a detailed version of events as he sees them. The word of a meth head. We know all about his history. We're well aware, but toxicology on Pinkman-- his blood is clean, he's not using. The kid is even refusing his doctor-ordered pain meds, as far as we can tell. So, um where do we go from here? A couple of gentlemen from OPR will come down, probably tomorrow morning. Janice will give us an exact time on that. And you men will be continuing your investigation, so Thanks for your time. Right. We just-- We need one more thing. Photo of Agent Schrader's hands, for the record. Yes, of course. Bandage off, if you would. Um, on the table is fine. Flat on the table is fine. [elevator bell dings.] [sobbing.] [elevator bell dings.] It's all going to work out. You've been too good to them for too many years. I hope it goes without saying that we're not talking to anybody about this, okay? Okay. Marie, who? [knock on door.] Hi. Do you have a minute? Sure. I guess crime does pay. I don't suppose you just came by to insult me. No. We need to talk. You heard about Hank? About what happened with this, um, Jesse Pinkman? Yes, I know. Whatever Hank was investigating, him trying to find an RV, is there any danger that could lead back to you? No. Why would it? Is this why you're here? I'm here to talk about Hank. Mm-hmm. You know what's going to happen to him if this Pinkman presses charges? Hank could lose everything. I thought maybe, um There's a way you could help him. How? Contact Pinkman. Get him to drop the charges. Look, Skyler, I don't know what kind of relationship you picture me having with this person. I'm not asking. He was-- He's-- He's not my friend. I mean, it's not as if we-- I'm-- were even close. I'm not asking. But there must be something you could say. Isn't it even worth a try? Hank is your family. Not currently. What? I said not currently. I'm late. I have to go. Hello. I was starting to get worried. Car trouble. Oh. That's a bummer. You should call me next time. I'll pick you up. Uh-huh. No, uh, no sandals today? I just thought-- a bit more professional. Well, everything is on track. We got our distillate. Just waiting to-- Let's get our trays ready. Clean, no moisture. Done. Is our, uh Our solvent filtered? I thought you might ask that. Done. That's good. That's good. Hand in glove. That's what we strive for. Yo5 know, this might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. [chuckling.] So, you the gentlemen? Lucky you boys called me. I got a load to pick up. I'm taking the 40 straight through to Memphis. I could hammer it out in about 15, but there's a girl down there named Lainie or Lolly or something. Maybe Fran. She's got one of these fetish things-- wants to get peed on. I was hoping to see her tonight, so I want to wrap it up here ASAP because traffic can be a wild card, you know, rubbernecking and such. The surprising thing is women who like to get peed on always tend to be from the warmer climates. You'd think the ones in the colder zones would be more inclined. Maybe it's a shock to the system if the body's not properly acclimated, but, you know, I leave that for smart minds than me. Science is a mystery. Well, take a gander. Prices are negotiable. Buying in bulk gets you a discount. I'm running a special on these little honeys. JHPs. Hollow-point bullets, known by the natives as Black Death. Check it out. Huh. You like that? So sweet, you want to lick it. Nickel-plated brass casing, Lubalox coat for panache. Sucker has six razor claws that expand upon impact. Whew. Shred your mama's head like a cabbage. Hmm. Keep it. On the house? Anyhow, I've been windjamming long enough. Why don't you boys tell me what you're looking for? What can I do you for? Vests. Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests. Right here. Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded non-interwoven Kevlar fiber. Stop a bullet like a soft wank against a Quaker girl. Just ain't getting through. And lightweight? Damn, so lightweight, you'll forget you're wearing it. They work? Sure as shit, they do. I don't leave home without it. Ohh! [stammering.] What the hell? You broke my freakin' rib, you maniac son of a bitch. [gasps.] [panting.] [bullet clatters.] [groaning.] You're welcome! [liquid bubbling.] Gale. What temperature did you set here? There? That's Station Five-- 75 C. I said 85. No. I, uh-- I wrote it down. You said 75. I-- I wrote it. Well, then you wrote it wrong. That's not what I said. I said 85. It's always been 85-- not 75, not 95. This is chemistry. Degrees matter. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Great. You're sorry. Meanwhile, you've just brewed Congratulations. Just dump it. Dump it all. This batch is ruined. You look nice. I look like a TV weatherman. You want a coffee? Nah. I squeezed some orange juice. You want to glass of orange juice? I'm all right. What are you going to tell them? Here's what you're going to tell them. He attacked you. He attacked me? He-- He swung at you with something. He-- He-- Swung at me.  attacked you with a pipe. With a pipe? It happened fast. He resisted arrest, and muscle memory kicked in, and you had to disarm him. Muscle memory. Yes. It happens all the time. Years of training, and your body acted faster than your brain. You had no choice but to hit him. You had to fight back. Marie, Marie, Marie. No. I'm not going to go in there and lie. It's some lowlife degenerate versus you Doing the job you're supposed to. Why should you be the one who pays for doing the right thing? Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing. It's not what the job is. I'm supposed to be better than that. And you made one mistake. No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been-- [sighs.] I've been unraveling, you know? I don't sleep at night anymore. I freeze. I freeze up. My chest gets all tight. I-- I can't breathe. Just-- I panic. Ever since that Salamanca thing. I mean, Tuco Salamanca. If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet between the eyes. It changed me. And I can't seem to control it. I tried to fight it. But then El Paso. And it's just gotten worse. What I did to Pinkman that's not who I'm supposed to be. That's not me. All this-- everything that's happened, I-- I swear to God, Marie, I think the universe is trying to tell me something, and I'm finally Ready to listen. I'm just not the man I thought I was. I think I'm done as a cop. Now, this is-- is not an easy decision, but it is one that I have to make. I'm sorry. This whole Gale situation-- he's-- he's just not working out. Yes. Now. It-- It may sound unorthodox, but I think our first-- best option Is Jesse Pinkman. Hello? It-- No, look. Th-There's-- There's a-- a shorthand that exists between us-- experience together at a level that, quite frankly, I-- I'm just never going to reach with Gale. Look, Mr. Fring, when I accepted your offer, I was told the lab is mine. And I know best how to run it. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, I will. I will. Okay. Good-bye. [Walt.] Listen, something's come up. And, uh, I think it's a good opportunity. There's been a job opening. I need a new lab assistant. I already did my time. Why don't you just go get yourself a monkey? I don't want a monkey. I want you. Oh, gee, thanks. Well, not interested. I got my own thing going on. Nice try saving your a-- head brother-in-law. That's not why I'm here, Jesse. There's more. It's more than an assistant. Partners. We'll be partners again. Split everything 50-50, just like before. $1.5 million each. No. I don't think you heard-- I've heard you fine. I said no. Let me understand this. You're turning down $1 1/2 million. I am not turning down the money. I am turning down you. You get it? I want nothing to do with you. Ever since I met you, everything I have ever cared about is gone Ruined, turned to shit, dead, ever since I hooked up with the great Heisenberg. I have never been more alone. I have nothing! No one! All right? It's all gone! Get it? No. No, no. Why-- Why would you get it? What do you even care as long as you get what you want? Right? You don't give a shit about me. You said I was no good. I'm nothing! Why would you want me? Huh? You said my meth is inferior, right? Right? Hey! You said my cook was garbage! Hey, screw you, man! Your meth is good, Jesse. As good as mine. [door closes.] [phone ringtone.] Yeah. [Jesse.] Yes. 50-50. Okay. Partners. Good. This is the statement you want to give? Yes, sir. Hank, you don't have to do this. No, I-- I do. I'm good. So we understand if we write it up like that, you'll sign it. That's the way it happened. I accept the consequences. In the light of these facts As of this moment, you're suspended without pay. I have to ask you to hand over your badge and your gun. Yes, sir. Schrader. Hold up. Yes, sir? I just want to tell you something. And to be clear, you didn't hear it from me. I don't want you to get your hopes up, but the word in the pipeline is Pinkman isn't pressing charges. Why not? Who the hell knows? Maybe you have a guardian angel. [elevator bell dings.] [Hank.] It went fine. Well, fine means what-- means what it means. Yeah. I'll, uh I'll tell you all about it when I get home, okay? Yeah. It's-- Yeah, it's just-- I don't know, baby. I just think-- I think we may be okay. Yeah. Okay. I love you, too. [phone rings.] [ring.] Schrader. [filtered male voice.] I need you to listen very carefully. Two men are coming to kill you. Come again? They're approaching your car. You have one minute. I don't get the gag, jerk off. Who is this? They're coming. Hello. [dialing.] Hey, Li-- Hey, Gomie, this is Hank. I don't know what that call's supposed to be, but it's dumb even by your standards, so call me when you get this. Aah! Aah! [groans.] Aah! [grunting.] [car door closes.] [screams.] [gun clicks.] [screaming.] [clip clatters.] [groaning.] No. [scraping.] [groans.]
