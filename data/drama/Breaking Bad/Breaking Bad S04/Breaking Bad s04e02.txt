Thirty-Eight Snub



                    			Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad I need you all outside to do some wipe outs. Wipe down this! I heard you broke new ground today. I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes. Yeah, I guess I broke new ground. You worked here four years. It's a story people would believe. This is what we buy. Slow down. Oh God! At the first opportunity Gus will kill us. So? How does it look? You mean, in do I see it? Yes. Do you see it? Basically, any lawman worth his salt's going to spot that, yeah. Assuming that's a deal breaker? Yes. It's a deal breaker. Well, if stealth is what you're aspiring to, you best go with something more compact-- .38 Special, snub nose. Got a concealed hammer so it doesn't catch on your belt when you draw. Tried and true, no nonsense about it. Five shots? Yep. Automatic has how many? Ten in the mag, one in the chamber. If you can't get it done with five, then you're into spraying prey, in which case I wouldn't count on another six closing the deal. You load that with 158 grain hollow points instead of your standard wad cutters. It's got plenty of stopping power. Can't get more dependable than a wheel gun. Here. Um Try it on with this. That snub, you'll conceal real nice if you carry it I-W-B. Little harder to draw from, but there's really no substitute if you're intent of fooling a vigilant eye. Comes in polymer, too. I prefer the feel of leather. Old school, I guess. Yeah, um You sure it's on the correct side? If you're right-handed, it is. I don't know, ma-- Are you sure because maybe it'll feel better on the left side. General rule-- You don't want to cross draw, not unless you're going to be sitting, you know, store clerks, card gamers and such. Either way you're going to want to practice your draw a lot because if you're all fingers, well, it might could be him keeping a piece instead of you. Catch my drift? What's this? That there is why you're going to pay me five times what you'd pay your neighborhood gun store. Serial number has been filed off. So to state the obvious, I don't want to be caught with this on me. No, sir, to state the obvious, you don't. You know, Mister, I've been providing my services for the past 30-odd years. You'd think in that time I'd learn better than to ask a man his business, especially about one referred by the lawyer, but I do feel the urge to ask you, we strictly talking defense here? Yes, absolutely defense. Why? Because if it's just personal protection, aside from a bucket of money, you'd save yourself a potential felony two-spot for carrying a weapon with a defaced serial number if you'd just buy it legally. Yeah, but if you did have to use it, wouldn't it still be better to use one that couldn't be traced? This is the west, boss. New Mexico's not a retreat jurisdiction. Man steps to you bent on doing bodily harm, you've got every right to plant your feet and shoot to kill. Some call it a moral right, and I do include myself within that class. All this to say I'm happy to take your money, but if you're not a convicted felon, you might best be advised to bear your arms within the confines of the law. It's for defense. Defense. I'll take it. Thanks, Bonnie. Jesse. What's up, brother? Dude, it sounds like an earthquake out there. Yeah. New sound system. Whoa! Check it out. Bodacious subwoofers, yo! Serious cannons. six of them. Aluminum columns so they're really, really like, uh, sonically neutral. Tweeters are killers, too. Dig all them lines jumping around. Psychedelic. Kind of like just want to stare at them. Hmm. Yeah, man. Totally makes me want to crank old Savage and blaze one. It's got, like, parametric equalization. Automatically adjusts the levels to changes in, like, air pressure and whatnot. It's a totally digital vacuum tube amp which is by far the best anti-distortion-wise. It's 120 decibels without breaking a sweat. Hold on to your hats, bitches. Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting yesterday. She asked about you. Thanks, man, but, uh Seriously? Maybe just a little bump. Left 4 Dead, yo, the way them bitches get all cranial when you cap them in the head. It's like booyah! No, no, no, man. Resident Evil 4 takes it by a long shot. Aw, please, brother, you're fronting. No, man, seriously. That chick, the one you got to rescue, she's smokin', bro, and then you're, like, the last undead dude on earth, so how can you not be dipping into that? Talk about inspiring a brother to kick some zombie ass! They're trying to eat your brain, bro. A dude don't need no more motivation. That's a fair point, I guess. Okay. Okay. Okay. Call of Duty, World at War-- Zombie mode. Now, that's the bomb, man. Think on it, bro. They're not just zombies. They're Nazi zombies. Nazi zombies. Yeah, man. S.S. Waffen troopers, too, which are, like, the baddest ass Nazis of the whole Nazi family! Zombies are dead, man. What difference does it make what their job was when they was living? Dude, you are so historically retarded. Nazi zombies don't want to eat you just because they're craving the protein. They do it because-- They do it because they hate Americans, man. Talibans-- They're the Talibans of the zombie world. I played the game, bro. They ain't exactly fleet of foot. Ohh! I'm saying where's the challenge? At least the zombies in Left 4 Dead clock a respectable 40. You got to lead them and shit. Dude, that's because they're not even zombies! They're just infected. They got, like, this rage virus. Amps them up like they've been smoking the schwag! Apples and oranges, bro. Totally unfair to compare the two. Yo, Jesse, where do you come out on all this? Ha ha! Ohh Agree, totally. Did that just happen? Damn, man. It's quiet. You know what this-- This place needs? Ohh. You okay? Fine. Can't you sleep? Actually, yes, Marie. This is me sleeping. What's it look like? Looks like you're looking at a rock at2:24 in the morning. This is not a rock. This is a mineral, for, like, the tenth time. Okay. Got it. Blue corundum, to be precise. Blue corundum. Well, it's very pretty. It's encrusted with igneous biotite in a mica schist. Would you like some more detail? Because I can give it to you. You keep acting like you give the first shit, and I'll-- Hank. Found in the Central Cordillera of Irian Jaya. Blue corundum. I'm just saying it's 2 in the morning. I'm justasking if maybe-- You know, when last I counted, Marie, there were four bedrooms in this house. You know, I mean, if I'm keeping you awake and all that. You have reached Walter White. At the tone, please state your name, number, and the reason for your call. Thank you. Walt? Hello? Walt? Um, okay, Walt, could you, uh, could you call me back, please? Hank's bills are really starting to pile up here, and, uh, in the meantime, I haven't received a check from you in quite a while, so there's that. Uh, second order of business is, uh, is the car wash. Ohh! God! Take the next step here. We need to look into buying this car wash while we still have-- Skyler. What are you doing? What do you mean? Wait. Are you screening all my calls? No. No. No. I just-- What are you thinking, leaving a message like that on my machine? What are you-- What did I say? You just left recorded proof of our intention to buy a car wash. Now you think that was wise? Proof of our what? What are you talking about? Skyler, we should not even be mentioning the words "car wash" on the phone at all, period. Walt, it is a car wash, not a brothel. I mean, if we can't even say what it is, why are we buying it at all? God, look, Skyler, please, just-- Hey, Mom. Hey, hon. Look, there's some cereal on the breakfast table. I'm telling you, if you're not willing to pull the trigger on this, I am more than happy to call Goodman myself. No, no, no, no, no. I will handle it, okay? I could so use a brain transplant right now. Hey, uh, I'm going to work. Wake up, bitch. Aah! Damn! Ohh. You're way too sensitive about your zone, bro. Ohh. Come on, man. Clean-up time. Right on. Least we can do. Hey. The hell with, uh, with cleaning up. Just go out and get everybody some breakfast. Stock up on liquor while you're at it. Keep this party going. I mean it, yo. I want this place kicking harder than a Sensei when I get back. All right. You got it, bro. Come on, damn it. Wake up and party! Hmm. Hello. Yo, you the new guy? Yeah. You got something for me? What's the count? Give it a second weigh if you would, please. New policy. What, Walter? Where's Gus? Why? Because I would like to speak with him. Because, the way we left things, I-- I would like the chance to clear the air. Hmm. What? Walter, you're never going to see him again. Oh, look who woke up hungry. Are you hungry? Yeah, that's good. Drink that up. Just a little longer, okay, my sweetie? Okay? There you go. Okay, now the Dodge gets a detail, and the Corolla gets a hand wax? Right? Hand wax. Okay. Oh. Hello. Hello. Just a few more minutes, and we're on our way home. Okay, my sweet girl? Mama's just doing her work here. Mama's doing her work. Let's see. Way to go, Hank. Whoa, way to soldier up. You're doing it! Come on! Another few yards. Damn! Ahh, Jesus! Look at you! Way to go, honey! Come on. Come on, Hank! Keep it going! Uhh! Just ten more steps. You're almost there, Hank. Uhh! God! Ha ha ha ha! Oh, yeah. All right, buddy. That's what I call kicking some ass. Oh, it was awesome, babe! Ohh. Hell, yeah. Very nice. Yeah! Hey! You're a good man, Chuck. Thanks. It's an honor, my friend. Same time tomorrow? Damn straight, if I'm still alive. Great session. Lots of positive energy. Lots. It's just it's so great to see that. It's just-- Yeah. One day at a time. All we can do. I know. It's just you've got a real way with him. It's-- You want to go full-time? We've got a spare bedroom. I'll see you tomorrow. Wow. You were so strong today. Did you work up an appetite? I'm sure that you did. Listen, I was thinking about cooking tonight. So-- Marie. Get out. Oh, yo, about time. Oh, my God. Yo, what's up with the pie, man? It ain't cut. Yeah. Right. That's the gimmick. What gimmick? This place. They don't cut their pizza, and they pass the savings on to you. What savings? How much can it be to cut a damn pizza? Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro, you know? Cut your own Christmas tree. Cut your own pizza. Yeah. It's democratic. What am I supposed to do with this? Don't sweat it, yo. You got some, like, scissors? I will cut this bitch up good. Yo, come in! Hey, would you mind? I figure you make, like, Each pizza takes, like, 10 seconds to cut. In man hours, that's-- I don't know. A lot? Hey, Jesse. Huh. You got, um, yeah. So, uh, how you doing? I'm dealing. How's Brock? Good. He's Brock, honey, wait in the car, okay? Let the grownups speak. Go on, little man. We'll catch up later. Guess you know I've been calling. Yeah, um, I'm really busy at work and-- Jesse, I'm not here to make you come up with excuses. You got other things going on. I get it. There's just one thing you and me got to talk about. And that's this. After TomÃ¡s was murdered, two dudes from the block, a couple bangers he used to hang with, get run over, one of them shot in the head. Same night, I get this in my mailbox. This was you? You know what? Whatever it is you had to do with my brother's killers, I don't want to know. But you got to tell me one thing. Is someone gonna come looking for this? No. What exactly am I supposed to do with this? Use it to get you and Brock out of that shit hole of a neighborhood. Or you can go out and spend it on glass, and I'd have no way of stopping you. But I got to believe you won't do that. Go home, Walter. How you doing? Hi. Ton of bricks? Rocks. You, uh, want me to wheel them inside for you? Thank you. Marie, is that my minerals? Yes, Hank. How many boxes? I don't know-- Three, four, a hundred, a million. I don't know. Did you check them for damage? Oh, my God. They're rocks, Hank. No, they're minerals. Jesus, Marie, I got some geodes coming that are very delicate, all right? And I will not accept any boxes that have damage. Those delivery jackoffs, I'm telling you-- I'm not getting ass raped by those bastards, all right? Just-- Honey, would you check? Just check, please? Hey, you, too much wax. Stop wasting it. Look, tell your brother that if he doesn't show up tomorrow, I'm going to have to fire him. So now go back. And no more excuses. Mr. Wolynetz, my name is Skyler White. How do you do? You want to buy my car wash. I do. And I am prepared to talk numbers right now, if you'd like. Do you think this is an easy job? You are willing to get down on your hands and knees and scrub like a house maid with all the chemicals eating into your nice skin and stinging in your eyes? Well, I know a thing or two about scrubbing. Any other advice for me? Because I am serious about this. Good. I am serious, too. I have worked 30 years of building this business from nothing, with my own hands and my own sweat and blood. I can appreciate that, truly. So, with that in mind, is there a figure you can quote me? One which you think would adequately-- $10 million. Well, let's try 879,000. Where do you come up with this number? You pull it from your behind? On a typical day, you manage 19 cars per hour. Extrapolating, I added the extra revenues for hand waxes and detailing, subtracted your overhead and salary and maintenance, operating fees, depreciation, which I obtained from comparable businesses in the Albuquerque area, giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here, to which I applied the industry standard multiplier and added the market value of your real estate, giving me a total estimated value of $829,000, on top of which I generously added an extra $50,000 so as not to be insulting. $20 million. Okay, Mr. Wolynetz, this-- This is the price for Walter White. Ah. Oh, yes. You don't think I know who you are? I remember. Well, I have not pretended to be any-- Your husband, he quit without giving me notice. He broke my air fresheners. He cursed at me and grabbed himself. And now he wants to buy my car wash. But he's not man enough to come in here and face me himself. Instead, he sends his woman. Excuse me? Walter White wants to buy my car wash. The price he pays is $20 million. Now please leave. Have you recently lost a loved one on an aviation disaster? Have you suffered injury, shock to the senses, or property damage as a result of airplane debris or, God forbid, falling body parts? Then call me, Saul Goodman. It goes without saying that the six-, seven-, perhaps even eight-figure cash settlement that I can win for you will never fill the hole in your heart caused by your tragic loss, but you deserve justice. So if you want to tip the scales back in your favor, better call Saul. Saul Goodman, attorney at law. (505)503-4455. Hmm. Se habla espaÃ±ol. You might want to learn how to tail better if you're planning on making a habit of it. May I buy you a drink? Next round, when you're done. Why not? You make a hell of a lot more than I do. Uh, another round for him, and I'll have the same. No ice. I feel like I need to explain myself. There were some actions that I took which I want you to understand. I didn't want any of this to happen. Everything I did I did out of loyalty to my partner, and then, later, of course, it was purely out of self-defense. I hope you can appreciate that just like I appreciated that, uh-- I appreciate that when you were going to kill me you were simply following orders. I get that completely. And I harbor no ill will. Well, there's a load off my mind. Mike, I'm trying to tell you-- I get it. Fine. Drink up, Walter. Hell of a last couple of weeks. Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands. Huh. I mean, I-- I cannot be alone in feeling this way. Not after what happened to Victor. So what's with the piece? Right hip inside your waistband. I noticed it the other day at the lab. You wear it if it makes you feel better, but if push comes to shove, it's not going to help. Mike, do I have to come right out and say this? You and I, we're in the same boat. Drink your drink. If it happened to Victor, it could happen to you. And-- And what the hell was that anyway? Hmm? A message? He cuts a man's throat just to send a message? You won, Walter. You got the job. Do yourself a favor and learn to take yes for an answer. Yeah, I got the job, but for how long? Get me in a room with him. Mike, just get me in a room, and I'll do the rest. You done? Yeah. Ohh! Oof! Ohh! Thanks for the drink. Ahh. Hey, my man, you know how to party, brother. Epic! Epic! Uh, seriously, where are you two going? Jesse, I've been awake for, like, three straight days. I'm turning into a Sleestak. So crash here. It's not like I ain't got the space. Yeah, that's cool and all, but I think I got, like, this cat. I think I'm, like, supposed to feed it. Whatever, you little bitch. What about you? You sticking, or do I got to flip you over and check you for a slizz? Bro, I'm kind of pushing flowers here, yo. I ain't proud of it, but it's God's honest truth. Hell, brother, you know we got man love for you. Now that you're back in the mix, it's like nothing but good days ahead. Plenty of time to pace it out is all I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah, man. Totally. I was thinking, like, next week? Yeah, sure, man. Next week. Are we cool? We are cool.
