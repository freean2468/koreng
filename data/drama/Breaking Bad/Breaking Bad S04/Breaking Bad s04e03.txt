                    			Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad - You're so strong today! - Marie, get out. I'm going to work. Keep this party going! Walter White wants to buy my car wash, the price he pays is 20 million dollars. He cuts a man's throat just to send a message? Get me in a room with him. You're done? Son of a-- I'm not leaving. Walt, I'm not leaving. Oh, my god. Ah. I can hear your cell phone ringing! This is ridiculous. I can't-- Ah. Uh, what is going on with you? I've left you, like, 23 messages. And? And? We need to talk about the car wash. You know, Skyler, now is not a good time for me, okay? Can we talk about this later? No, okay? We can't. Why are you do-- Oh, Jesus. What happened? Nothing. I just bumped it. That's all. Okay, I'm-- I'm coming in. Okay, exactly what happened? It's complicated, and I don't wish to discuss it. It's none of your concern. Are you in danger? Uh-- Walt, I need you to look me in the eye and tell me right now, are you in danger? You know what? Let's just say that I have a hell of a lot more on my mind right now than thinking about buying a damn car wash. Okay. So if you could just please Okay. Then we go to the police. What? We-- We tell them everything-- That you're a drug dealer afraid for your safety, and-- And the safety of your family-- Whoa. Whoa. And you need-- You need help. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What choice is there, Walt? What choice? If you're in danger-- Then it would be absolutely-- Stop, stop, stop. You keep saying that word, danger-- - Danger. - But you just said-- No, and I have never used that word. I said things were complicated, and then you flew off the handle. Yeah, I flew off the handle when I saw that, okay? Where'd that come from? Hmm? A fall in the shower? Uh, this is just so passive-aggressive, you know? I-- Passive-aggressive? Are y-- I go two days without returning your phone calls, two days, and I have one minor little incident, and now you're telling me to-- I should turn myself in to the police, for God's sake. - A minor little incident? - Yes. What minor little incident? I had an argument with a co-worker. Okay? And? I had an argument. We were in this bar, and we were discussing a particular business strategy, and-- And it got heated and out of control, and he hit me-- Once. And I didn't retaliate because he's a much older man. And that's it. You were in a bar fight? Yes, Skyler, I was in a bar fight. So you're okay? Really? Yes. I'm okay. And I think in the end it may have been a good thing, actually, because we were able to clear the air and, you know, mutual respect. So-- Frozen peas. What? It's the best thing for the swelling. Oh, it-- It-- It's not really swollen. It's-- No peas. You don't even have ice. I will get peas. I will get ice. Peas and ice. I'm writing it down. I, uh I need you to Promise me that if things do get dangerous-- promise me. Absolutely. So-- Car wash. Charles? Hi, there. Can I answer any questions? Yes. Any chance of a top-off? Oh, I think we can help you out there. So what do you think? Oh. Very nice. Very open. Oh. I agree. It flows. A whole lot of natural light. Uh, Michael Kilbourne. Tori Costner. It's nice to meet you. Well, three bedrooms, one and a half baths, on just under half an acre. That's a non-attached casita out in back, permit usable as office or guest suite. Hmm. Plank wood floors. Central heat and air. I-- I see you're married. No. Divorced, very recent. Old habits. Oh. I'm sorry. Any children? Yes. As a matter of fact, a little boy. Oh. How old? Uh, he turned 4 in may. He's a gemini. Would love this yard. Oh, well, plenty of space for a jungle gym, and the neighborhood preschool is fantastic. Oh, well, I think Eli is going to be home-schooled. Oh, well, great. Not for religious reasons or anything. I just want to make sure that he's getting enough attention. He'll still go to summer camp and whatnot, you know, play dates. I don't want him to be socially awkward. Oh, no. Makes a lot of sense. He tests very highly-- But that whole right brain, left brain-- You want those in balance. You said the casita has plumbing? I will go out with Clay, so I need access to running water. Well, it's pipe fitted for a quarter bath, so make a perfect studio. Hmm. This could work. Hell, that's the doctor's plan to get her patients at ease, if you know what I mean. But, nurse, I'm not one-- Hello! I'm back! Hank? Yeah. Ohh. I had to go to three different places to get the moisturizer that you like, but I got that, and I got your Shiner Bock and your chips, and I couldn't resist. The complete encyclopedia to fantasy football. Look, it has all the latest rankings. Marie, I said Cheetos, not Fritos. W-wait. Uh-- I must have said Cheetos, like, ten times. You need me to write it down for you? No, and I don't need you to be mean about it, either, Mr. grumpy. Well, I'm just saying, you know. I said Cheetos. Ch-ch-ch sound, virtually impossible to confuse Cheetos with Fritos, it seems to me. Where are you going? Uh, back to the store, I guess. Here. And the draft's not for two months, so this is useless. Can you believe it? What? What? This. Well, you always thought this place could be bugged. Now we know. Yeah, well, I don't like it. It's a violation of the work space. Yeah, I guess. Want to do something? Do something? Like what? Go-karts? Go-karts? What-- Yeah, there's a track down by the Coliseum. It's pretty fun. No. Actually, I have-- I have a meeting, so-- All right. Whatever. Rain check? Yeah, sure. How you doing? Good. Yeah? You okay? Is there, uh, anything we should talk about? How's your eye? Yeah, it's fine. Anything we should talk about? For what it's worth Getting the shit kicked out of you Not to say you, uh, you get used to it, but You do kind of get used to it. Two words-- Nail salon. It's perfect for money laundering. It's a high volume cash-preferred business with a discreet work force. I mean, nobody does "mister, me know nothing" better than Mrs. Mookjaiaporn and her gals. Mr. Goodman-- Saul, please. Now, for the lady of the house-- Drum roll, please-- how about a lifetime supply of French manicures and enzyme peels? Ah, yeah. Go ahead, pinch yourself. Ha ha ha! We're not buying a nail salon, Mr. Goodman. We're getting the car wash. I'm sorry. Am I missing something here? I mean, didn't you already try that? Yeah. I mean, Walt told me that you, uh, took a run at this Bogdan character, and he wrestled you into submission with his eyebrows. asking price, right? Apparently, he upped it to 20. Ha ho! Nice negotiating. Yeah. I-- Hey, you bombed. It happens. You were smart to call me. Now-- Uh, you just sit back, relax, and let a professional take over. Who is that? That's for me. Excuse me. What do you want? I'm in a meeting. Why didn't you think of that before? It's not my-- I'm in a meeting. Can Huell use your bathroom? Huell? Uh, sure. The top of the stairs. He'll be quick. It's a stomach thing. So where were we? Professionalism. Yeah. Um, so the guy won't sell, he won't sell. I don't accept that. I don't accept that he won't sell. I-- I think he just lacks the proper Motivation. Motivation. Oh. Uh, as in "motivation" motivation? I mean, just so we're on the same page here. You're saying we make him an offer he can't refuse? Nothing so dramatic as that, no. Motivation. Attitude adjustment. Ho ho ho ho! This one, she's a keeper. Well, an audit can be highly motivating. I know a gal over at tax and revenue. You give her ten minutes on this Bogdan fella's books, she'll have his sky raining frogs. No, we don't want to draw any unwanted tax attention. We don't want them looking at us after Bogdan sells. All right. How about an I.C.E. raid? You know he's got illegals working over there. I mean, he just has to. We are not getting a bunch of poor innocent people in trouble, no. Yeah. And also, you're going to need them after you take over. Tck. Hey. How about terrorism? "Oh, agent Hoover, I got to tell you, "I've seen some real islamic comings and goings over there at the car wash." Yeah, I mean guys in turbans pulling up in vans and stuff like that. Ha ha! Saul, Bogdan is Romanian. Okay, well, we're-- We're just spitballing here, so Okay, there's always "You got a real nice place here. A shame if something happened to it." That angle. What are you talking about? Violence? Attitude adjustment. Oh, no. That? No. That is not at all what I meant. I-- We do not do that. That's not who we are, right? Yeah. No. No. No, she-- She's right. Look, do I need to state the obvious? I mean, there's got to be dozens of car washes in this area. Who says it has to be this one? I do. I say it has to. Why? I just do. God. Well, that clears things up. I don't like him-- Bogdan. He was condescending to me, rude about you, and I do not like him. Simple as that. Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do, but, uh, in this business, and Walt can back me up on this, the number 1 rule is-- Don't take things personally. What do you-- What do you mean, rude about me? Something along the lines of You weren't man enough to face him yourself. What? That you had to send your woman to do your business for you. Okay, uh, speaking as your lawyer, I'm going to go on record and say this is a bad idea. Now, I advise against-- It's this one. Okay. So, uh All we have to do is think of a nonviolent, unsuspicious way to purchase the car wash that-- That-- That protects the innocent and doesn't cost $20 million. Don't everybody speak at once. Hi. Can I answer any questions? Oh. Spoons. Yes. The owner is quite the collector. Aren't they something? One for each of the 50 states. Uh, Puerto Rico is technically a territory. Huh. You know, maybe they were thinking Some day. Uh, so no basement. No basement. Sorry. That's a problem. My brother's in the peace corps, and won't be back for 18 months, and I said I'd hang on to his furniture. Well, if you're looking for storage space, there's an attic area that's sizeable. Oh. Huh. Well, an attic might be even better, as long as it's dry. - Let's take a tour. - Okay. Actually, I have a handout for you. It has all the information. I'm Stephanie Doswell, by the way. Charlotte Blattner. So nice to meet you, Charlotte. You, too. So I just told him point-blank-- "You're my husband, and I love you. "But you're 53 years old. "This job has just gotten too stressful" and difficult, and it's time to quit. And, miracle of miracles, he listened. Still, what a fascinating career that must have been for him. It was. I mean, NASA was like a second family to us, but, you know, it was time for a new adventure, so, between his pension and the income I bring in from hand modeling, we're, you know, comfortable. Uh, when were these floors redone? Two years ago, and the counters are brand new. I can tell. Travertine. Hmm. Nice. Any children? No. I don't really want kids. Is that horrible for me to say, do you think? Not at all. Not everyone has to have children. Hmm. You should talk to my husband. Uh, garbage disposal? Mm-hmm. Aah! Check it out. Score, yo. I really love your home. Well, thank you, Mimi. It has a Very European feel. You think? Oh, I lived in London for years, so yeah, this feels familiar. Where in London? I was stationed at Upwood in the '60s. Right downtown. But we were almost never there. My husband is an illustrator, so we traveled a lot-- Paris, Italy, Denmark. It was before the kids were in school, so it was easy to pick up and go. That was before my youngest, Lucy, was diagnosed with endocarditis. Oh, my. Gosh, is that, uh-- It's a bacterial infection of the heart valves. It's-- Yeah, it can be-- Mmm. That's terrible. Is she all right? Your daughter. Is she okay? Yes. Th-thank you. Um, the doctor's put her on a prosthetic valve, so she's-- Lucy's fine. Running and walking, riding horses. Well, thank goodness. Yeah. We'reVery lucky. Yeah. Excuse me. Miss? Very nice. Thank you! I just called the police. Okay, then. I know you stole that spoon. What spoon? What are you talking about? You're a thief. Excuse me? And a liar, making stories up about yourself. What's wrong with you? No. What's the matter with you, lady? You better just back off, okay? My husband is a DEA agent. I thought he was an astronaut or an illustrator. You better get your crazy lies straight. You know what, fatty? You are so lucky that I am late for an appointment. You're not going anywhere. Hey, my purse. Not until the police get here. Let go of it! Let it go! Let it go! Let itGo! You are in big trouble. Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just sl-- Slow down. Start from the-- You-- You're where? Why the f-- Why are you-- Are you seriously doing this to me again? Jesus, just st-- Would you stop crying? I'll make a phone call. Just sit tight. Where do they got you? So good news. The officer spoke to the homeowners, and they're not going to press charges. Good. I won't, either. Okay, then, so we're good to go. You ready? Marie, you want to go home? Marie? Yes, it's Skyler White calling for Saul Goodman, please. Yes, it is important. Thank you. Sorry. Same as before. But this is not right. You cannot shut me down. You cannot do this. Mr. Wolynetz, I've checked your waste water inside and out. I've checked your runoff gutters, and now out here more contaminants-- Ammonia, acetone, benzene, nitrobenzene. No, no, no. This is a mistake. Where is Gary? He will tell you my soap is very good, very green. No, your soap is not the issue. It's your filtration system. At the very least, you'll need to retrofit. But if you're leeching into the ground water, which is looking like a real possibility here, you're going to need to replace your system entirely. Replace? Do you know how much cost that is? $200,000. Look, I understand it's a hardship. If you like, we can give you a list of approved vendors. If you get going immediately, your down time shouldn't be any more than four or five weeks. Okay. So sorry. You're right. From now on, we will be extra careful and, uh, clean. No more pollution, okay? - Yes? - No, I'm sorry. The state requires you to suspend all commercial activity until these levels reach the mandated minimums. Where is usual man? Where is Gary? He got transferred to Las Cruces. If you'd like to file an appeal, you can contact-- I have done nothing wrong. Tell me, why you shut me down? What laws did I break? What laws? Several. Tell me exact specific laws, or I refuse. - Specific? - Right now. The-- Tell me exact-- - The specific laws-- - What laws? Hold on, okay? Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Okay. The New Mexico hazardous waste act of 1978, section 74, chapter 4, part 13 states, "whenever the disposal of solid waste or hazardous waste presents--" An imminent or substantial endangerment, the offender may be fined not more than $5,000 each day in which the violation occurs. All right. Okay. Now the Okay. Okay, baby. All right. The EPA can cite him under the toxic substances-- Control act of 1976, U.S. code title 15, chapter 53-- Subchapter 1-- Section 2606. Satisfied? Was that specific-- Enough for you? All done with lunch? Hmm. You hardly touched this. I'm not hungry. Well I'm leaving the rice pudding. I'm not hungry, Marie. So don't eat it. Hey, Marie. How you doing? I-- I'm okay. Is there a problem? No, no. Everything's fine. I'm here for Hank, actually. Oh. You're so sweet. Hank will be thrilled. Sweetie, you have a visitor. Ah, Jesus. What now? She rob a bank? Hey, buddy. How you doing? Oh, well, can't complain, you know. Every day a little better. That's good. You're looking good. Yeah, well, handsome was never the hard part. Come on in. Grab a seat. Yeah, just throw that stuff anywhere. Listen, uh Thanks again for the other day. You know, this-- This whole thing, it's, uh, it's been hard on her. Forget it. Glad to help. So, rock collecting? They're minerals. Yeah. Uh, it's cataloging them-- Sort them, label them. Um, it's actually a lot of work. Yeah? No, it looks like it. So, what's up? Well, actually, I could use your help on something. Homicide, possibly drug-related. You want my help on the case? What am I, Ironside? No. But you're a drug cop who knows the local talent, and you're a pal I just did a favor for, so let me pick your brain a second. You ever come across a guy by the name of Gale Boetticher? No. Someone came along and shot him in the face. Okay. No signs of forced entry, no signs of robbery. Okay, so it's a crime of passion. Where's the drug angle? We found a notebook at his place. I made a copy for you in case your interested. Looks like it pertains to some kind of methamphetamine superlab. Ah. It's filled with scientific formulas and chemical purchase lists Drawings, pages and pages of this stuff. It looks big time, but I'm no authority, so I wonder if you might take a look. Come on, Tim, seriously. What is this, some kind of a charity thing? I thought your expertise could be useful here. I'm lying here like, uh, third base, living from bowel movement to bowel movement. I'm not even useful to myself. Want my advice? Take this to Steve Gomez. He'll help you out. I give this to Steve Gomez, and all of a sudden it becomes a DEA case. What good does that do me? If you could just take a look, tell me what I got here, I'd really appreciate it. Eh. Whatever. Thanks, man. You take it easy. That's what I do. Well, it was a good try. Here we go. Time for your nap. Yeah. Oh, you're good. So Nail salon sounded promising. What do you think? I think we wait. Wait. Skyler, it has been five hours. He'll call. Ahem. Just wait. Just wait. Look. It was a good idea. It was a great idea. But it didn't work. So why don't we simply chalk it up as a learning-- White residence. Oh, hello, Mr. Wolynetz. Am I still interested? Well, I-- I think that depends. Yes, 879 was the original offer, but that seems high to me now. Now I'm offering 800. No, no, no. No, no. Don't do that. - Why? - Don't do that. Well, because you're an unpleasant person, Mr. Wolynetz. You were rude to me and disrespectful towards my husband. - Skyler-- - And furthermore, I've met with quite a number of sellers, and the market seems much softer than I thought. So 800. You are talking crazy. Uh-huh. You are a very, very crazy lady. Well, I understand that you're disappointed, but that is my final offer. I'm sorry we couldn't make it work. Goodbye. What are you doing? I'm negotiating. Why? Because I want to pay less. Oh, now-- $79,000 less? Who cares? Do you know how much I make in a day? Yeah, but that's the very reason we need to negotiate. We don't want to arouse suspicion by not trying to get a good deal. Look, I get the logic. I do. But you just went too far with it. You're calling him names? I didn't call him names. Ohh. I said he was unpleasant. Ohh Well, he's not calling you back. I mean, you didn't honestly think that worked. Yeah, I do. Oh. No way. Sorry. No. - So-- - Ahem. It's time to move on, okay? I'm going to call Saul. Where's my phone? Wait. No. - What? - No, just - Wait, wait. - What for? Wait, wait. For-- Oh, my God. Hello. Hello, Mr. Wolynetz. No one's really paying attention to where these things are. I mean, there's got to be thousands of them all over the world and on boats coming right for us. And put on inside an ice cream truck, drive it into San Francisco. I'm not even that scared of burning up in cannibalism. To me the things that-- Thing that worries me is-- Is getting trampled or-- Or shoved up against a chain link fence because if you really think about it, if you were against a chain link fence and you've got a-- A lot-- I mean a lot of people trying to escape, pushing hard enough forward. It's not a joke. You're going to get squeezed right through the chain links like Pla-doh or some kind of soft meat. Uh, and this is inevitable, okay? And there's nothing you or me or anyone can do about it. And if the fence posts are stuck deep-- Really deep with the cement way down inside the ground, then it's definitely happening to you. - Blood on the wall. - Yeah. Bitch. Somebody got shot. Somebody probably got shot. Like soft meat, man, right through-- Being squeezed through there like soft meat. Like soft meat, right through the chain. Right through the-- Right through the chain. It's-- It's inevitable. Just-- Hey. Hey. Money! Whoo! Whoa. Ohh. - Ohh, nice. - Yeah. To Clean cars and clean money. Hear, hear. You see? I told you we'd get it. Did you? Mm-hmm. Wow. Seriously, that was really great work. It's impressive. Thank you. And Saul finally came through. Ahem. Well, I mean, he found the guy, right? Well, yes, he found the guy, but I told him what to do and what to say. You're right. That's the hard part. But yes, Saul was, uh Finally useful. Throw him a bone. Mmm. Oh, my God. This is truly amazing. Yes, well, it better be at $320 a bottle. What? CuvÃ©e Pol Roget, Sir Winston Churchill. Apparently, it was his favorite champagne, so they just named it after him. How did you pay for it? What do you mean? Ah. No. Cash. I paid cash. No, I'm-- I'm asking how did you, Walter White, an unemployed schoolteacher, pay for it? How do you explain it? Skyler, no one saw me. Whoever sold it to you did, and that's not the point. The point is we're broke, remember? I mean, I'm waiting for your unemployment check to come so I can pay the phone bill. I asked for an extension from the power company. Why? Because on paper, we have no money. You are completely overreacting. I'm not apologizing for wanting to celebrate in some small way. I'm not asking you to apologize, Walt. I'm asking you to be smart. I bought one bottle of champagne, one single bottle, Skyler. I paid cash. That's it. That's all it takes, okay? I mean, look at Watergate. One-- One little piece of duct tape - left in a door-- - Oh, my God. Brought down the president of the United States. What, I'm Nixon now? No, what I'm saying is the devil is in the details, okay? One little mistake, one slip-up in our story, that could ruin us. Fine. Got to destroy the evidence. When I look at this-- This image that is part of the record, I am very concerned about what sort of distraction that can be, whether it's from any sort of signage but especially a signage that's changing every five seconds. Thank you. Any other questions? We have a motion and a second on the floor to grant the appeal. All those in favor, raise your hand and say yes. Yes is for the affirmative. Those opposed? There's five no's, and that motion fails. I would like to make a motion to uphold the decision.
