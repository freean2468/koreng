                    			 Honey mustard. [Footsteps approaching.] [Speaking german.] [Beeping.] [Knocking.] [Knocking.] [Knocking loudly.] [Man speaking german.] [Knocking loudly.] [Knocking loudly.] [Door thudding.] [Banging on door.] [Whirring.] [Electrical arc.] [Banging on door continues.] Madrigal [Jesse.] Honest to God, it's starting to drive me crazy. [Walter.] Well, don't. [Jesse.] It keeps me awake at night. I lay there thinking, "Where is it? Where did it go?" - And I just-- You know, I can't even-- - Jesse, Jesse, Jesse, look Doesn't it make sense that it wound up in the lab? I thought about that a lot. But I just don't see how. Well, look. You had the pack in your pocket of your jacket, right? - Yeah. - And your jacket was in your locker, so maybe the cigarette just fell out of the pocket and wound up in the locker, and now it's all burned up. - It's gone. - Yeah. But I don't know that, you know? I can't ever know for sure. [Sighs.] Well, look, did you check your house? Did you-- Maybe it's somewhere in your house. No, man. I've looked everywhere, okay? Your car? Did you check your car? No, no-- - Thoroughly? - Yes, of course. Look, it's not in my house. It's not in my car. And the more I think about it, there's no way it fell out in my locker. And I keep thinking somebody's gonna find this thing - on the street or something. - You don't know that. - Somewhere where I dropped it. - No. Some innocent person, some kid maybe, even. No. No. Come on. And they're gonna pick it up, and it's gonna-- You're working yours--/i> - Oh, my God! Jesse, listen. You've gotta get ahold of yourself here. All right? I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna come over there, okay? And together, we're gonna look for this thing. - All right? - Yeah.  [Rock.] [Sighs.] Ohh. What the hell is that? My Roomba. I already checked it. When? Like, a week ago. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Okay. Easy, easy. Take it-- Careful. Let me see. Is it still intact? Yeah. Good. Good. No worries. Let me get rid of this. What luck. Whoo. [Toilet flushes.] Well, I don't know about you, but I, for one, could use a beer. You have any? Jesse? I almost shot you. Hey, hey, now I almost killed you all because Listen. It was just a-- A misunderstanding, that's all. No. No, no, no, no. I don't know what's wrong with me, Mr. White. - I - Hey. [Crying.] I don't know how I could be so stupid. Stop that now. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. [Continues crying.] Listen to me. What happened, happened for the best, you hear me? I wouldn't change a thing. You and I working together, having each other's back. It's what saved our lives. I I want you to think about that as we go forward. Go forward where? [Chatter on TV.] Ohh. [Man.] Stillwell, steady as she goes. Ohh. Willie, note the time. Whoo. - Ohh. - Captain, I'm sorry, - but you're a sick man. - Mmm. I'm relieving you as captain of the ship under article 184. - Oh, God. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Helmsman, left 180. - Ohh. [Helmsman.] Mr. Keith, what do I do? [Knocking on door.] I told you to come left. Now come left, and fast. [Man #1.] I'm sorry, sir, but you're not issuing orders on this bridge anymore. [Knocking continues.] I've relieved you. I take full responsibil-- Thanks for seeing us. We're here to talk partnership. Partnership. Yes. Equal. Three ways-- You, Jesse and me. Well, we figure we're gonna start cooking again. You know, we figure, why not? There's no denying the popularity of our product. There's a market to be filled, - and currently no one to fill it. - A lot of money to be made And obviously, Jesse and I have manufacture covered. But there's still distribution, support, logistics, that sort of thing. For instance, we'll need a steady supply of precursor. With your experience and connections, you would be a great help. Mmm. Granted, there's a lot of work ahead. There's a lot of rebuilding. And, no doubt, our profits will be smaller. At least at first. But each of us will receive a larger cut. Owners, not employees. Thanks, but no, thanks. Mike, I know you don't care for me. We've had our issues, you and I. I would suggest that you leave emotion out of this decision. I am. You are trouble. I'm sorry the kid here doesn't see it, but I sure ash hell do. You are a time bomb tick, tick, ticking, and I have no intention of being around for the boom. Well, sleep on it. Maybe you'll reconsider. In the meantime, we're pressing on. Morning. Hey, why aren't you upstairs? - I came to see if you needed any help. - Yeah, well, I don't. Well, I can see that, man. It's outstanding. Yeah. I'm working on it here. Not exactly running marathons here, you know. Yeah, well, when did your couch-shaped ass ever run any marathons? - I'm proud of you, brother. - Yeah, yeah. So how many cars we've got? Enough to invade Poland. Came in their own G5, just like Oprah has. - G5, yeah? - Mm-hmm. Is that one where the-- Where the wings go up like that? - I think they all do that. - They all have that? Anyway, we got two U.S. attorneys in the house. Big doings. Your name keeps coming up. Yeah? Hey, give me a hand here, would you? Just-- just a little bit there. Thanks. [Herzog.] I hired Peter Schuler in 1992. Almost single-handedly, he grew up a little restaurant division into an industry leader and a source of great personal pride. I am shocked and saddened by his death and outraged by the damage his actions have brought upon my grand-father's company. [Speaks german.] Alleged actions. An innocent man does not kill himself. My people and I are here to help. Through your investigation I pledge Madrigal's full cooperation and transparency. I confess I have my selfish reasons. I believe Peter Schuler was a lone anomaly. But if that is not the case, I want to know it, just as you do. So when you gonna announce it? I don't know. - As I'm walking out the door with my big cardboard box.- You can't do that. You know damn well we're gonna throw you a big party. Damn straight. We're talking a blowout. Outstanding police work, Hank. If only I'd listened. But I guess the damage was done. It's not right, them putting this on you. Somebody's gonna go under the bus. Ramey's a good man. He'll do right by you. Besides, this office practically runs itself. Bullshit it does. Sir. What's with that APD thing? The electromagnets? They're thinking it's about Fring's laptop. Turns out a couple of days before it happened, desk sergeant gets this phone call from a "postal inspector"-- Quote, unquote-- Wanting to know where they keep the thing. And he told them? Jesus. Anything left of the laptop? [Scoffs.] Do we look that lucky? You know, I sneaked a peek before APD took it out of Fring's office. The whole thing was encrypted. They wouldn't have got anything anyway, but So Hector Salamanca killed Fring. But who gave Salamanca the bomb? Whole lot of questions and not much in the way of answers. Yet. The APD did find some of Fring's financials. That just might lead to something. I had him out to my house. Fourth of July. We cooked out in the backyard. My son shucked the corn. My daughter cut up potatoes. Fring brought sea bass. Every time I grill it now, I make a little foil pouch, just like he showed me. That whole night, we were laughing, telling stories, drinking wine. And he's somebody else completely. Right in front of me. Right under my nose. Hi. What can I get you? - Just tea, please. Chamomile. - Oh, sorry, we don't have chamomile tea. Then some sort of bergamot, provided it's not Earl Grey. I like soy milk instead of dairy. We don't have soy milk or any sort of bergamot. Wow. You're really running me through my paces here. Uh-huh. Well, English breakfast, I guess. We have Lipton's. That's pretty much all we have. I would like a cup of hot water, filtered, if possible, ad a single slice of lemon. And I'm assuming you don't have stevia? Never mind. I brought my own. You coming to me, or am I coming to you? Face forward. We'll talk like this. I guess I'm coming to you. Ohh. Mmm. Take a breath, will you? This place is safe, no one's gonna see you here. My God! Duane, this is so-- Thank you. How did I not see you sitting back there? So weird. [Chuckles.] You want anything else, Mike? No. I'm good, Fran. Thanks. [Sighs.] How about we lose the sunglasses? I feel like I'm talking to Jackie Onassis here. There you go. Breathe in, breathe out. Drink your whatever. Who killed Gus? Haven't I told you not to worry about that? Now, what do you want from me, and why is it so important? What's this? A list of 11 names. Okay. You know them all. I do. Those 11 men-- and I think you know this, Mike. Those 11 could sink us, you and me both. Where are we going with this, Lydia? No specific. I'm just pointing out facts. These men-- your men-- yours and Gus's-- these men were on the payroll, very publicly. They trace back to Pollos and the laundry. They trace back to Madrigal, and they're gonna get picked up by the police. And when they do, when they get picked up and threatened with prosecution, and there's only one way out for them, they're gonna-- And I'm not saying all of them. Okay? All it's gonna take is two or three, or even one. But there's always a weak link somewhere. But they're gonna talk. At least one of them's gonna talk about you, about me, and that's all it's gonna take. These are the 11 I know of, but I'd love your input. I never met your chemist, for instance. I'd love your input. You want me to kill every man on that list? Wow. That's a leap, what you just, uh No, I didn't say that. But if you think that'd be wise [Sighs.] You're scared, aren't you? Yeah. You're very upset, which I'm gonna factor into my response here. These are my guys, and they are solid. - Understand? - What about Chow at the warehouse? Didn't one time you have to shoot him through the hand? You think that didn't stick in his memory? What about Dennis at the laundry? They're sure to pick him up. They already have. They picked him up last night. My guys are solid. I vetted them with great care, and Fring made sure they were well compensated in the event of a situation such as this. They're paid to stand up to the heat, keep their mouths shut, no matter what. And they will. Now, I don't know what kind of movies you've been watching, but here in the real world, we don't kill 11 people as some kind of prophylactic measure. Look at me and say you understand. I understand. I get it. So we're off that very silly idea? Good. Drink your hot water. - I gotta go. - Have you had enough? Yeah. I'm good. Okay. [Quietly.] Bye-bye. - Bye. - Bye. Bye, big brother. [Chuckles.] Say bye to mom for me. I will. Have a good day. You, too. [Door opens.] [Sighs.] [Door closes.] [Quietly.] - Skyler. - Mmm Hey. The car wash opens in 15 minutes. Mariano can open for me today. Hey, how about you get up, huh? Come on. A shower will feel good. Hey, Chow. How you holding up? Okay. You know, they-- they-- They talked to me. You can't smoke in here, Chow. [Elevator bell dings.] [Hank.] Thanks for coming down. Have a seat, Mr. Ehrmantraut. Am I, is that right? Close enough. So, once more, you're waiving your right to have an attorney present? Correct. Could you state that to the camera, please? I'm waiving my right to have an attorney present. Uh, okay, then. We just have a few questions. You're currently employed by the Pollos Hermanos chain. - Is that correct? - Yes, I am. - And what do you do there? - Corporate security. - Corporate security? - Yeah. What's that? Like, uh, guarding the special sauce? I conduct employee background checks, I oversee loss prevention. At a fast-food restaurant, that's a full-time job? We have 14 locations. So, yes, it's a full-time job. Yeah, well [Chuckles.] If I were you, I'd start sending out those resumes. It says here you're a private investigator? Where you licensed? New Mexico, Arizona, Utah. Every state where we operate. Colorado? You have some restaurants there, right? Colorado doesn't require licensure. You licensed to carry a firearm? Concealed carry? Yes, I am. Which states? It'd be quicker to mention the states in which I'm not. And if we pulled your CCP's, everything would be in order? I'm guessing you've already done that, so you tell me. You strike me as a former cop. Am I right? Where at? Philadelphia. Philly. [Chuckles.] The city of brotherly love. It turns out we, uh-- We know some folks there, and they told us that your tenure as a police officer ended somewhat, uh, dramatically? You wanna talk about that? Not particularly. Yeah, me neither. See, I'm more interested in why Gus Fring decided to put a guy like you in charge of his corporate security. I mean, given your history doing background checks on pimple-faced fry cooks. Seems like over What else you do for Fring? He must've needed help running that drug empire of his, no? Drug empire? First I'm hearing about that. I don't know anything about that. Hey, man, we have a guy that could put you in that underground lab, and he'll testify to it. So from here on out, this can go hard or easy, so what's it gonna be? Forget your handcuffs? I'm confused. Am I under arrest here, or am I not? You wanna state that for the camera? You are not under arrest, currently. Agents, do you have any more questions for me? Because you've got me very stirred up with all these false accusations. If I'm not under arrest, I'd prefer to leave. Uh-uh. And I suppose we could talk about the two million dollars in your granddaughter's name. Yeah. It seems, uh, Fring had all these secret offshore accounts that he would deposit money into-- Like, uh, well, an even dozen of them-- And they're all in the names of certain people on his payroll. There was the, uh-- The manager of the laundry, um, a couple guys from the Pollos distribution center. There was the owner of a chemical warehouse, a bunch of others. You know, guys that must've been getting paid off the books. Anyway, one of the names was Kaylee Ehrmantraut. Ten years old and just cute as a button. Yeah. Two million and change we found on deposit for her. Way more than anybody else. Now, my partner here, he took one look at that and said, "Shit, man. This fifth-grade girl is the muscle behind Fring's entire operation." I said, "Whoa, whoa. Hey, partner, slow down there. Maybe it was actually her dear old granddaddy." Impressive, no? But [Clicks tongue.] Level of insight? He's not impressed, Gomie. Perhaps he's picturing all that money going bye-bye. Yeah, well, I mean, the government's gonna take every last dollar, unless Well, here's the thing, Mike-- or Michael? - Mr. Ehrmantraut. - Here's the thing, Mike. Lucky for you, you didn't touch that money. I cannot say the same for the other 11 on the list. One of your guys is gonna roll on you, and then we'll definitely remember the handcuffs. Now, before that day comes, you can do yourself a solid. You can tell us what you know, you can tell us who's still out there, and if we like your story, good things can happen. Kaylee might be able to keep some of that money. Maybe. So what do you say? I don't know anything about any money. I don't know what you're talking about. First order of business is to find a new place to cook. Before anyone says it, no more RV's. I don't know. The crystal ship did pretty good for us. The "crystal ship"? - Yeah. That's what I called it. - Well, I'll admit it held us on as a starter lab, but it was too dark, too small, not to mention it could've broken down at any moment. Saul, find us someplace safe from prying eyes. Security against detection is paramount. But I don't wanna drive too far. No more 50-mile treks to some Indian reservation. In town is trickier. I mean, you got a lot more of your prying eyes. If Gus can manage it, then so can we. Precursor. Where are we with that? Uh, we're good on everything except, uh, methylamine. No surprise. It's just dry as hell out there. What if we switched back to a pseudo cook? Absolutely out of the question. Jesse, there is methylamine out there. I know it. Yeah, but what if there's not? Because there isn't. I mean, really. There is. Have faith. Can I-- Can I offer a thought? Uh Say a guy wins the lottery. Ten million bucks. The very next day, what's the one thing he does not do? He does not go buy another lottery ticket, right? He counts his lucky stars, and he sails off into the sunset, which, seems to me, and all due respect, some advice you two might take. What lottery did I win exactly? Hey, you're alive. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that's the Irish sweepstakes. I'm alive, and I'm broke. Counting the money that I owe Jesse, I'm about 40 grand in the hole. Does that seem like an acceptable stopping point to you? There is gold in the streets, just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up. But, me? I should quit now. Jesse, too, I suppose, huh? Wow. I got you this time, kid. And how come you get two, and I only get one? Hmm? Oh, no, you don't. That one's mine! [Mutters.] No. Aaahhh! [Phone buzzing.] [Mutters.] Oh. [Buzzing continues.] I give up, baby. You're too good. [Beeps.] - Yeah? It's me, you got a minute? Yeah. A minute. What's up, Chow? The DEA, they call me to come back. - Say they want to talk more. - I'm sure they do. [Toy whirring.] Did you call your lawyer? Yeah, but, Mike, the DEA take all my money. I need it. I need my money. You understand. What do you want me to do about it? I don't know. I don't know. We gotta talk. Not on the phone. Can you come to my house? All right. Give me two hours. [Beeps.] [Whirring, soft thudding.] [Whirring, thudding continue.] [Mike.] Chris. I'd like you to drop your gun where you stand, and then turn around very slowly. [Gun clatters.] [Sighs.] Come on over and sit next to Chow. [Exhales forcefully.] How much was she gonna pay you? Ten thousand a name. How far did you get down the list? Just Chow. I figured I'd start with you. For you, she was gonna pay 30,000. I'm very sorry about this, Mike. But I needed the money. Those feds, they took it all, man. I know. Are you ready? Listen, Mike [Shells clatter.] [Exhales.] [Woman.] Kira, come and have some cookies. It's a cookie! It's a cookie, yes! Let's go. Uh-huh. Vamos a contar. Let's count. [Together.] Uno. Dos. Tres. - Cuatro. - Mm-hmm. Cinco. - Seis. - Seis. Muy bien. - Siete. - Siete. [Together.] Ocho. Nueve. Diez. Muy bien. Ahora los colores, a ver. - Amarillo. - Amarillo. - Rosado. - Rosado. - Azul. - Azul. - Verde. - Verde. - Marron. - Marron. [Door opens.] [Door closes.] Anaranjado. [Footsteps.] Anaranjado. Well, look at this. What are you doing? - Hey, mommy! - What are you doing still up? Hey, yourself. Give me a kiss. She said she wanted to wait for you. She does, huh? Well, who's the adult here, Delores? Tell me she ate her dinner, at least. [Delores.] Oh, yes, she ate everything. She ate her peas, she ate her carrots. [Whispering.] Do whatever it takes to keep them out of here, or they die. - Understand? - She ate a whole lot of carrots this time. [Kira.] - Yep. - That's right, my girl. Delores, I'm gonna take a bath. Put Kira to bed and then go on home. I'll see you tomorrow. Really? You don't want me to wait for you? - No, you go home. - Thank you. Si, Ms. Lydia. Buenas noches. Mommy, you gonna come say good night to me? Yeah, honey. After mommy takes a bath. Okay. Love you. [Delores.] Mommy's very tired, so let's go to bed. [Gasps.] [Door closes.] I won't have to unless you scream. You know why I'm here? What are you waiting for? The nanny to leave. If you have anything to say to me, now's the time. [Scoffs.] Two good men died because of you. Don't shoot me in the face. Please. I don't want my daughter seeing me like that. - Your daughter won't see you. - Yes, she will. She'll find me. She never once sleeps through the night. Nobody's gonna find you, Lydia. Wait. What? No. No. No. No! Sh-she has to find me. - Lower your voice. [Whispering.] - She has to find me. She has to find me. I-- I-- You want your five-year-old daughter stumbling across your dead body? I can't just disappear. She has to know I didn't leave her. - She has to know that! - Keep your voice down. I don't care what you do. I'll scream and I'll keep screaming. My daughter's not thinking I abandoned her! Shut up and calm down. I don't care. You have to promise. You have to promise me [Door closes.] Promise I don't disappear. Can you still get your hands on methylamine? Methylamine, Lydia. Can you still get it? Maybe. Why? [Beeps.] [Phone buzzing.] Aww [Buzzing continues.] Yes? [Mike.] You still plan to move forward? Yes, we do. I've reconsidered. I'm in. Good. [Grunting.] Well, you missed a good meal. The lasagna came out very well, if I do say so myself. [Shoe thuds.] I wrapped some up for you if you'd like some later. [Shoe thuds.] [Grunts.] [Exhales forcefully.] You know, it gets easier. I promise you that it does. What you're feeling right now About, uh, Ted Everything It'll pass. [Sighs.] When we do what we do for good reasons then we've got nothing to worry about. And there's no better reason than family.
