                    			Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad You need me gone, 'cause your brother-in-law is never gonna let up. Excuse me He a no-show? Why didn't you c--? You and him-- you took it right out of my pocket. The ricin cigarette! And all for Mr. White!? He poisoned Brock and you helped him! Jesse!? Jesse! You show yourself right now! I'll be in touch. Okay. Hey, Huell. Listen, I want you to swing by the high school on your way to Saul's. I can't believe that he would go after my son, but You got it. And Kuby's at the car wash, right? Parked right across the street. All's quiet. No Pinkman. Okay. Just find him. Please leave your message. Jesse, listen, uh, I mean, obviously you've changed your mind here, and so thank you for that. And I know you're angry. I wanna fix this, okay? Whatever it takes, all right? We'll talk, and we will fix this. Until then, just-- just sleep it off, okay? And then call me. Be safe. How's it coming? I replaced the doorjamb and the striker plate. Switch this out, we'll be good to go. Good. Oh, hey, uh, do you want separate keys for the different locks, or do you want just one working both? No, no, no. No re-key. Same exact keys as before. Okay, it's just that usually with a break-in, people like to get new keys. No, same key, same locks. The old keys have to work here, okay? - Okay. - All right. Good. Good. Good, good, good, good. Oh, no, no. Um, hey, guys, guys, guys. Cut that. Yeah, this, uh That area's still pretty bad. Right, right. We'll have to go over this a lot more. Well, we've made three passes already. Like I say, gasoline's tricky. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. The smell has got to be gone completely. My wife is coming home, and I can't have any odor, any stain, any sign that anything happened here. Understand? I-- I know. This is short notice, and I really appreciate it. Sir-- sir, we'd love to take more of your money, but you've got gas soaked straight through to your subfloor. Until you pull this up and get new carpet, new padding, this is as good as it gets. Is that gasoline? Ask dad. Hey. Over here. What happened? What happened is that I should sue someone. That's what happened. So I'm on my way to the drugstore, and I have to stop to get some gas, and there is this total pump malfunction. You know what? She really shouldn't be in this room at all. I mean, this is supposedly green, but you know how it is. You can close the windows in the nursery, because it's really only out here. Ugh. This is as good as it gets. So, um, pump malfunction? Yeah. So I'm standing there filling up like I've done a thousand times before, and I hear a chunk. You know, the pump's nozzle. The-- the metal thing. The thing you squeeze, right? I hear a chunk. So I suppose, in my naivete, I took to understand that gas is no longer coming out of the nozzle, so I pull out the hose to put it back and whoosh! You know, I am suddenly soaked in gasoline. I mean, on my arms and my legs and my-- my groin. So now I am in a panic, and I race home, I run inside the house, and I'm stripping off my clothes as fast as I can. I jump in the shower. It's not until after I get out of the shower that I realize my gas-covered clothes have been soaking in the living room rug this entire time. I mean, it's-- it's-- the whole thing is just so stupid. I could have rinsed off at the station. Halfway home, I'm starting to realize-- wait a minute-- there's a water hose right there next to the air pump. You know, for tires. Anyway, so that was my day. How was yours? - Dad? - Yeah. Please, can you just tell the truth? Tell-- What do you mean? You fainted, didn't you? 'Cause you're sick again. You were pumping gas, and the fumes, they-- they made you pass out again. Just-- just admit it. No, the-- no. It was the pump. All right, I-- I-- maybe I did get a little swimmy at one point, but I did not faint. Okay? I'm fine, and that's the truth. However, in the best interest of all of our continued good health, I don't think we can stay here. I mean, not until we get new carpet. Yeah. Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie, they-- they got plenty of space. Hey, what about a hotel? A hotel. That could be sweet. A-- a good one. I like the way you're thinking. Yes. Could be a little family vacation. Might be fun. What do you say? Why don't you put some clothes together? Yeah. All right. I'm sorry. It's not my finest hour. I'll go pack a bag. - Okay. - Okay. Think this'll leave a scar? I never should have let my Dojo membership run out. Jesus. Jesse did that? Yeah, but you gotta understand, deep down he loves me. So where is he? - Still looking. - Where have you looked? His place, his folk's place, uh, this Brock kid's place. Crack shacks at Siesta Hills, the Indigo, the Crystal Palace, go-kart joint on Copper Ave. Uh, AA meeting off the 40. His buddies, Beaver and what's-his-name? Uh, Badger and Skinny Pete. Yeah, no, he's not with them. They could be covering for him. I posed as a meter reader. I put a bug in the tall kid's mom's place. For three hours straight, all he talked about was something called Babylon 5. I checked with my gal at APD. Uh, she said Pinkman's not in their system, so the cops don't have him. Yet. Maybe he changed his mind about leaving, called your guy back. No. Somebody misses their first chance with my guy, there's no second. Well, keep looking. What then? What do you mean? I mean, Pinkman's like a bad penny. Sooner or later, he's gonna turn up. I'm wondering what you wanna do when he does. Jesse is upset about the boy. I just need to explain to him why that had to happen. Okay, but say, you know, just for the sake of argument, the kid's not in the mood for a nuanced discussion of the virtues of child poisoning. You know, his plans are running more towards stabbing you to death with a pointed stick. In that scenario, then what? You have a suggestion? We were wondering if maybe this isn't an "Old Yeller" type situation. "Old Yeller"? Yeah, Old Yeller was the best, most loyal dog there ever was. I mean, everybody loved that mutt, but one day he showed up rabid, and Little Timmy, for Old Yeller's own sake, had to, uh Oh, you-- you saw the movie. You're full of colorful metaphors, aren't you, Saul? Belize, Old Yeller. Just brimming with advice. Do not float that idea again. Find him. Sorry. Ah. Sorry. Room key wouldn't let me into the ice room, so I had to go down to the front desk. But here we are. Checked in on Junior. Pay-per-view and room service. He's in heaven. Hey, I thought you were gonna take a bath. How's Saul doing? Saul? Goodman? I have no idea. No? You were just out talking to him in the parking lot. I'm sorry. Were you spying on me? Yes. And I feel just awful about it too. You know, I played along with your pump malfunction bullshit because Junior was standing right there, but now I would like to know what's going on. First of all, it's no big deal. Coming here is just me being overly cautious. Jesse Pinkman, you know? He came over to the house that time for dinner, remember? Well, he-- he got upset over this-- something he thinks I did. I did do it. But I did it for very good reasons. It's-- just-- it's complicated. Wait. Are you-- are you telling me that he tried to burn our house down? That was, probably for a brief moment, his intention, but obviously he changed his mind. And how does that work? Him-- him changing his mind? Ah, God. Look With-- You've got to understand. With-- with Jesse, there are emotional issues, personal issues, some drug abuse. But he has always been more of a danger to himself than anyone else. He has a tendency to fly off the handle. That's all. So he has never hurt anybody? No. I can't believe you got her down so fast. Oh So what's your course of action here? Saul's guy, Kuby, tracks him down, which shouldn't take long, and when he does, I'm gonna I'm gonna talk to him. Make him see reason. "Talk to him. Make him see reason." So I'm clear, these are just euphemisms you're using here, right? No. What? Wh-what does that mean? My God. I knew this was going to happen. I knew it. I told you that someday, someone was going to come to our door and try to hurt us. And now here we are. No. Jesse didn't go there to hurt anyone. He poured gasoline all over our house, Walt. He tried to set our house on fire. He changed his mind. He didn't do it, did he? What if he changes it back? Walt, you need to deal with this. How much have you had to drink? Not nearly enough. I-- I don't know how we got off on whatever it is we're talking about here. But clearly, I haven't explained the situation well enough, because this is a big overreaction. We all need to just take a deep breath and calm down, because Jesse isn't just some-- some-- some rabid dog. This is a person. A person that is a threat to us. I mean, my God, where we are now with Hank and Marie and that awful tape we made. After everything we've done, you can't just talk to this person. You're s-saying that I just What-- what exactly are you saying? We've come this far. For us. What's one more? Jesse! Stop what you're doing and turn and face me! You wanna-- you wanna know what he did? You wanna hear about it? Jesse, put out the lighter. He poisoned a little kid. An eight-year-old boy. Just because, you know-- just as a move! Walt's a bastard. Secret's out. We'll talk about it. But I need you to put out the lighter, okay? Look, Jesse Jesse, I don't want to kill you. And you don't wanna be killed. So put it out. He can't keep getting away with it! He can't keep getting away with it! He won't. You really wanna burn him down? Let's do it together. So you were fo-following me? Yeah. Since Goodman's. Where we going now? DEA. Downtown. What, I'm, like, arrested? Yeah, you know how this works. Be a good witness for me, it'll go better for you. Yeah, sitting around MDC, waiting to be a witness against Mr. White. It's It's gonna go great for me. So you're angry. I can't sleep. I'm not eating. Last night I was online for six hours looking up untraceable poisons. This close family friend had been keeping a secret from you and Hank, and somehow this person's secret became known, and now you're sad and hurt and angry. I'm-- I'm in the ballpark? To be this wrong about someone. This off. We all live double-lives to some extent, don't we? - We all have our secrets. - Yeah. Not like this. Not like him. Marie, I think it's time you filled me in on some more details here. Who and what are we talking about? I said I can't do that. It'd be bad for Hank. Our friend made that clear in his little movie. Those kids under his roof. That baby. I'm sick just thinking about it. How could I have not seen this? If I weren't being such a idiotic, stupid idiot, I could've-- We could have Blackjack winnings. Nothing suspicious about that at all. Tell me about this movie. Dave, can't we simply just focus on my feelings here? The details don't really matter, do they? There is nothing to be done, okay? He screwed us, and he won. Can we just Can we talk about something else, please? Yes? How's work? Last week, you were upset about the new parking rules. Marie? Saxitotoxin. "Derived from shellfish. Produces a flaccid paralysis that leaves the victim conscious through a progression of symptoms. Death occurs from respiratory failure." That is definitely a contender. Marie, you're not ready to fill me in here, that's fine. But I want you to listen. There is no problem, no matter how difficult or painful or seemingly unsolvable, that violence won't make worse. I know. I Don't worry. I wouldn't hurt anybody. I just It just feels good to think about it. - Hey, babe. - What's the story here? Oh, uh, well, uh, something's come up. I thought you might wanna get outta the house for a day or two. You thought I might wanna pack up and move out of my own house. Why? What's going on? Look, I don't wanna get into it now. But you know that thing with Walt? There's, uh-- there's been a development. What happened? Are you in danger? No. No, no, no, not at all. Just-- it's a fluid situation, and I think it might go a little smoother if you're not here. So, I, uh-- it'll be great, you know? I-I-I booked you a spa package at La Posada. You can do that river stones thing. Hank, what the hell is going on? Hank? We have a guest. He was a little keyed-up. Gave him a couple sleeping pills. Okay. So listen. I bring that kid in and-- and put him in the system, Walt's gonna find out five minutes later. You know, my last ten witnesses died in jail, remember? A-a-and I can't use a DEA safe house without writing him up. I can't risk a-- a motel. I know it sounds crazy, but this is the best place for him. For now. Just for a day or two, tops. Okay, just answer me this one question Is this bad for Walt? Yeah. Very. Good. I'm staying. I'll heat up lasagna. Phone's ringing. You have one new voice mail. Jesse, listen. Uh I mean, obviously you've changed your mind here, and so thank you for that. And I know you're angry. And I wanna fix this, okay? Whatever it takes, all right? We'll talk, and we will fix this. Until then, just-- just sleep it off, okay? And then call me. Be safe. Hey. Hey. What are you still doing up? Couldn't sleep. Ah. You and me both. Here. Have a seat. - Everything okay? - Oh, yeah. Just business stuff. Going over some options. You guys still think you might buy another car wash? Oh, uh, yeah. Well, maybe. See how it goes. How it goes now that-- now that you're-- you're sick again, right? No. That's not what I mean. Hey. Told you not to worry, remember? H-how can I not worry? Come on. You think I came all this way just to let something as silly as lung cancer take me down? Not a chance. I'm not going anywhere. Should've brought our suits, huh? It's okay. It's all right. I'll be up in a minute. Okay. See you in the morning. Okay. Would you like some coffee? Morning. You want some coffee? Uh, no. Uh, the lady, um-- I think your wife-- You take cream and sugar? Uh, black's-- black's good. Thanks. Uh, thanks. Thanks. This is probably gonna take awhile. Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'll run some errands. - Okay. All right. Uh, you remember, uh, Agent Gomez? How you feeling? Your head clear? Yeah. This-- this can't be what you mean by burning him to the ground, right? I-I got stories that'll make your toes curl, but, you know, it's just "My word against his word" kind of stuff. So, you know, I don't really have any, like, proof or anything. Gomie, can you, uh, grab the curtains over there? There's a-- there's a glare thing happening here. You know he's retired, right? He's-- he's not even in the business anymore. So you're never gonna catch him with a camcorder. We're gonna catch him. We gotta do this first, okay? Come on. Just, uh, tell us everything you remember. Any business dealings, any personal dealings, any criminal activity you were a witness or a party to. Anything and everything. Just tell us your story, okay? Start from the beginning. When did you first meet Walter White? Right. Okay, uh I first met Mr. White-- Walter White-- in junior year chemistry. He was my teacher. You believe him? Yeah. I do, unfortunately. And I hate to admit it, but I think the kid is right. There is no physical evidence, not that I heard. Yeah, well, no weapons, no bodies, no working lab. Just the word of one nut-job meth-head against Mr. Rogers-Has-A-Lung-Tumor. So, do we take a run at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle? Vamonos Pest? Follow up with the Drew Sharp killing? Where do we start? I say we start with this. Jesse, I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza tomorrow at noon. I hope you'll give me the chance to explain myself and talk through everything once and for all. I'll be alone and unarmed. So if you wanna come and shoot me in the head, that's up to you. Either way, I'm in your hands. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go and talk to that asshole? You-- you can't be serious. Go and listen. He wants to explain himself. We put a wire on you and let him explain. So your plan is to do his plan? You-- you seriously think that this-- this whole "Once and for all in the Plaza" thing is so he can talk to me? Why not? I-- I-- I can't believe you two. The dude wanted me out of town before I came to burn his house down, and now I'm even more of a threat to him, okay? And he's got a zero-tolerance policy on threats, you know? If I go to this Plaza, I'm a dead man is why not. Hey, Walt's ruthless. He'll do just about anything to protect his interests. I agree. Except when it comes to you. He cares about you. Can't you see? Oh, yeah. You mean when he's not, uh, ripping me off or calling me an idiot or poisoning people that I care about? Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me. Everyone knows that. No, I mean it. Based on everything you told us. Uh, he paid for your rehab, uh, ran over those two drug dealers with his car. Sounds like he saved your life. Uh, made you a 50-50 partner. He didn't need to do that. Yeah, no, he sort of did. I'm the only one near as good as him, so I don't know. The way you tell it, sounds to me like he's manipulating you to stick around. Like he doesn't wanna lose you. All those numbers he-- he runs on you, over and over, helping you find the ricin cigarette. Come on. Look how far he'll go to show you-- to convince you that he's not such a bad guy. - That's what this is. - What if it's about, um, killing me, you know? You know, getting me out in the open, hire some, uh-- some clock tower guy, or-- or have me sit on a poison needle, or something, you know? Nothing's gonna happen to you. I mean, the Plaza's one of the most wide-open public places in all of Albuquerque. It's middle of the day. And Agent Gomez and I will be right there with you. Look-- look, you two guys are just guys, okay? Mr. White-- he's the devil. You know, he is-- he is smarter than you, he is luckier than you. Whatever-- whatever you think is supposed to happen-- I'm telling you, the exact reverse opposite of that is gonna happen, okay? Jesse-- Jesse, we're not brainstorming here. This is not asking. Unless you know another way to get the man, or unless you wanna take your chances with the banger boys over in MDC, then this is it. This is what's happening. I gotta piss. Can I piss? Yeah. Down to the left. You got another SD card? What? What if the kid's right? What if it's a trap? "The kid"? Oh, you mean the junkie murderer that's dribbling all over my guest bathroom floor? Well, then, he's right. Pinkman gets killed, and we get it all on tape. Remember, you're hurt, you're angry, but you're here for answers, okay? But don't, uh-- don't push the questions, okay? Let's not get him suspicious, all right? You let him do the talking, right? Just relax. That's what-- that's what matters most. Don't cross your arms, if you can help it. Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek. Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek. You getting that? Loud and clear, idiota. How's it looking, Gomie? No change. He's just sitting there. Are we doing this, or what? Ready to kick some ass, partner? All right. Time to go. Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this? What's with the kid? He's just standing there. What the hell's he doing? He's on the move now. He's taking off. I think he's running. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, kid. Come on. You got him? He's at the pay phone. Who the hell is he calling? Oh, no. No, no, no. Come on, kid. No! Come on! Hello? Nice try, asshole. Jesse, where are you? I just wanna talk to you. No. I'm not doing what you want anymore. Okay, asshole? This is just a heads-up to let you know I'm coming for you. See, I decided that burning down your house is nothing. Next time, I'm gonna get you where you really live. Jesse, listen to me. Jesse? Jesse? - Daddy! Daddy! - Hey! Get in. Little son of a bitch! Stupid, high little-- What the hell was that all about, huh? What were you thinking? - Thinking there's another way. - What? To get him. There's another way. A better way. Uh Hey. It's Walt. I'm okay. I, uh Todd, I think I might have another job for your uncle.
