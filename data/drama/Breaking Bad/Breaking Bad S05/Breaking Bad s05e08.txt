Gliding Over All



                    			 [Buzzing.] Mr. White? Hello? [Buzzing.] Mr. White, the, uh, car's been dealt with, sir. No one tailed you? No. I stayed off the main streets and kept checking, so Joe ask any questions? I told him RV job, just like you said, and he totally knew. It's pretty cool the way they do that-- Turn a car into a cube. So, should we deal with this other thing now? [Buzzing.] [Sighs.] Yeah. Sure. [Car alarm chirps.] I don't want to talk about this. Okay. It had to be done. Okay. All right. I need to talk to you. In private. So what's the story? You get to Mike? Mm-hmm. He get out safe? He's gone. [Sighs.] All right. Well, what about those nine guys in jail? They got no reason not to talk now. So what do we do? "We"? Who's "we"? There is no "we," Jesse. I'm the only vote left, and I'll handle it. [Door closing.] Gliding Over All My client will supply vital information relating to the organization, distribution, and production of Fring's methamphetamine enterprise. In exchange, we expect all charges to be dropped, and Dennis not only walks out of here a free man, but also receives blanket immunity. [Scoffs.] For what he's gonna be furnishing, this deal is plenty fair. [Scoffs.] Best I'd be willing to do is queen for a day and reduced charges. All charges dropped. Queen for a day and a five-K. That's the best you're gonna get. No way. Guys, come on. You can be a fairy princess, for all I care. Where you going? I'm going shopping for someone who can tell me something I don't already know. Hey, hey. I got plenty you don't know. You seem a little confused. This here is a buyer's market. I got eight other assholes just like you, four of them within I also got Dan the douche bag lawyer who's gonna give me the money and Ehrmantraut. So settle in, Dennis. Enjoy your new home. I'm gonna go rattle some cages. [Door opens, closes.] So? Maybe you should order something. Do you want a coffee or something? Not just now. I think this would play better if you ordered something. I think this will play just fine, and I'm not thirsty. So let's take a look at the list. Lydia, you've come all this way. - You do have the list? - Yes, I have it. Good. It's just not written down. And why is that? It's in my head. Safer there. I see. Then I suggest you pick up a pen. Not just yet. It was my understanding that attending to these nine names was precisely what you wanted. Ten names now. Ten, counting the lawyer. Yes. Ten, counting the lawyer. So, what, am I not tying up loose ends for our mutual benefit? You're tying up loose ends, and I don't wanna be one of them. Once I give you that list, I've served my purpose, and then maybe I'm just one more person who knows too much. So, you put that list in my hands, and in your mind, I immediately just murder you, - just right here in this restaurant? - No. - Right here in this public place, immediately? - Not right here. - That is not what I-- - Listen, Lydia. You made me promise on my children's lives that I guaranteed your safety. From Mike. You guaranteed I'd be safe from Mike. There's no way he'd ever go for this-- You getting rid of his guys. You wouldn't be doing this-- The names-- if Mike were still a factor. Yeah. That's what I thought. What do you want, exactly? Because if you don't want to give me that list, then I've truly got no use for you. I can grow your business exponentially. Just give me the list. I can do that by helping you expand into a larger, highly active, highly profitable marketplace. What do you know about the Czech Republic? The Czech Republic? Did you know there's a higher demand for meth there than anywhere else in Europe? Five percent of its ten million people, which is roughly the population of the Southwest from Western Texas to Phoenix, are using meth. You keep your market here, but by adding overseas sales, you can more than double your current profits. And I checked. The average purity is only about 60 percent. They've never seen anything like your product. You'll blow their hair back. Shipping internationally seems like courting disaster. - Not if you're Madrigal. - Madrigal is under investigation by the DEA. The restaurant division, mostly. We've got 46,000 employees spread across 14 divisions. And once Mike's people are no longer a factor, things should tidy up nicely. This is what I do, you understand? I move things from point A to point B all over the globe. a month, and all of it right at my fingertips, a laptop click away. The Czech Republic Who's there on the other end? People I ship to regularly. People I've worked with for years. They're professional and very amenable. I'm very careful who I work with. And if this is such a slam dunk, then why didn't you pitch it to Fring? I did. He said yes. We were in the final stages of working it out when somebody killed him. You don't think Gus Fring built his distribution network all by himself? There are considerable advantages to diversification of distribution, like putting 6,000 miles between you and your product. At 25 pounds a week, I'm estimating you'll gross about two million. Give me ten pounds to start, and we'll see how it goes. All right. Now, with Fring, my end was gonna be 30 percent, - which I believe is more than fair. - Okay. - Trust me, if you do this-- - Lydia, learn to take yes for an answer. Now, first things first. Shake on it? We're going to make a lot of money together. [Door opens.] [Door closes.] [Beeps.] Todd, I think it's time I meet your uncle. [Man.] No iron pile. There's too many muscle-heads flexing their shit. Too many eyes. [Man #2.] Okay, so no chow line, no yard. Gonna keep it simple. Pass-byes. Yeah. Hallways, shower room, cells. The easy stuff. [Man #3.] I say we go with a riot. Our boys get it done in a riot. No, no, no. No chaos. I don't want the goon squad rolling in and stealing our shot, you know? This has gotta be fast and quiet. Just boom, boom, boom. - You know what I'm saying? - Yeah. Surgical. Surgical. That's what it's gotta be. So how many guys we got at MDC? Three, counting Shaddock. And he makes the schedule now, so we can put who we need where we need them. All right. So MDC's covered. What about the rest? We need G block in Valencia, right? Our guy's on the night shift. - Have him pull a double. - Nah. His supervisor's got some hard-on about OT. Have him switch with somebody. I don't know. Just get it done. Regardless, you know, we got enough guys in Valencia right now? Might have to hire out. You high? Mix blood with chuntaros? - No way. - Well There's no need. We got enough. Hitters ain't the problem. - It's that short walking window after lunch. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's gonna be tight. Real tight. You know, I gotta be straight with you, man. Taking out all these guys is doable. But hitting them in three separate jails all within two minutes? Whacking Bin Laden wasn't this complicated. [Chuckling.] Where do you suppose these come from? I've seen this one before. I wonder, are they all in some giant warehouse someplace? Hey. It can be done, just not the way you want it. It can be done exactly how I want it. The only question is, are you the man to do it? Figure it out. That's what I'm paying you for. [Chuckling.] [Sighs.] [Ticking.]  [Lounge music.] [Crying out.] [Door rattles.] [Blows landing.] Aah! [Men grunting.] [Grunting.] [Ticking continues.] [Alarm blaring.] [Men grunting.] [Thud.] [Alarm continues.] [Muffled yelling.] What's happening? Oh! Oh! No, man! Help me! Help me! Help! Help me! [Ticking stops.] [Sighs.] [Laughter.] Excuse me a second. Grab more photos, will you? [Phone ringing.] Yes? [Man.] It's done. New details have emerged in the spate of jail deaths that rocked central New Mexico three days ago. As of yet, no names of victims have been released, but authorities continue to investigate what appears to be a carefully coordinated sequence of attacks that occurred within minutes of one another in three different correctional facilities - Is it okay if I turn this off? - Oh, sure. I don't want the news on right now. Hank just pulled up, and he's not in the best mood. Oh, all right. Well, I'll get out of your hair. Okay. Hi, honey. Mwah! Dinner will be in about an hour. And I thought we could have that chicken that you like. Or-- or we could order Chinese? - Sure. - There you go. There you are. Wanna play with your toys? I'll see you in a little bit, okay? See you in a little bit. Hey, Hank. I was just getting ready to leave. Want a drink? Um, yeah, sure. Thanks. [Coos.] Perfect. [Mutters.] - Rocks, right? - Rocks, yes. [Holly cooing.] [Sighs.] Been thinking about this summer job I used to have. Oh, yeah? Back in college, I'd spend my days marking trees in the woods with this-- this orange spray can. Marking trees? Yeah. Crews would come in later and find the trees I tagged and cut them down. First, you go in, and you mark locations for skid trails and landings. Then you choose specific trees all within a selected grid. [Sighs.] Every day, I'd go back, hike in, pick up where I left off. Oh. Sounds nice, being out in the woods all day. Nah, it wasn't so great. I got sunburned. There were mosquitoes. I just wanted to make a few bucks. Buy beer. Been thinking about that job more and more lately. Maybe I should've enjoyed it more. Tagging trees is a lot better than chasing monsters. I used to love to go camping.  [Pop rock.]  [Continues.] [Song fades out.] This way. Here, baby girl. Come see your brother. There you go, sweetie. That's it. [Cooing.] Oh, my God! Look at her go! Good job! [Walter, Jr..] - Peekaboo. This way. [Skyler.] - Good job! Here. Let's go see your brother. Let's get him. - Get him! - Where'd you go? I can't see you. Where'd you go? There you are! [Chuckling.] [Laughing.] You're really good with her. [Coughing.] Come here, my baby girl. You're gonna be a handful, aren't you? Yeah. Mama's gonna get her exercise. Aw. [Cooing.] [Cooing continues.] [Sighs.] Hey, do you, uh-- You wanna watch a movie? [Phone ringing.] Hey, Louis. Uh [Clears throat.] One moment. Uh, nothing. [Chuckles.] What's up? [Sighs.] Oh, well. [Sighs.] [Chuckles.] It's nice to see you smile again. I mean, you seem good. Yeah. I'm hanging in there. To see you laugh like that just now It's such an improvement, don't you think? I don't-- I don't really [Stammers.] We've been thinking, Hank and I, that it may be time to take the kids home. It's been almost three months, right? Almost three? Um D-does Hank not want-- Oh, no, no, no. Oh, God. No. No. Hank's crazy for these kids. You know that. It goes without saying, we love having them. And we're always here for you and wanna help you any way that we can. But We're starting to worry that maybe Maybe we're enabling you. Sweetie, you've had a lot on your plate, and you and Walt have had a lot-- so much to contend with. And I'm so proud of you for going to therapy, by the way. You know that, right? It can be so helpful, such a good tool. And I'm very, very proud of you, but I-- We Maybe at this point, the best way to help repair the family would be to repair the family, you know? [Crickets chirping.] [Water lapping softly.] Take a drive with me. Walt. This is it. This is what you've been working for. I rented this place, and I started bringing it here, because I didn't know what else to do. I gave up counting it. I mean, I had to. It was just so much, so fast. I-- I tried weighing it. I figured one bill of any denomination weighs a gram. There are 454 grams to a pound, but [Exhales forcefully.] there's a variety of denominations, so How much is this? I have no earthly idea. I truly don't. I just stack it up, keep it dry, spray it for silverfish. There is more money here than we could spend in ten lifetimes. I certainly can't launder it, not with 100 car washes. Walt I want my kids back. I want my life back. Please tell me How much is enough? How big does this pile have to be? [Soft whirring.] [Click.] [Mechanical humming.] [Clacking.] [Towel dispenser clicks.] [Door opens.] Ow! Aw, shit! [Sighs.] [Knocking on door.] [Knocking.] Hi. Hey. Um, I-- I hope I'm not disturbing you or anything. I tried calling, but, uh-- Yeah. No, I, uh, tossed all my burners. Oh. And you didn't answer your home line, so-- It's disconnected. Oh, um, unplugged, I mean. Did you leave a message, or Uh, no. So, what's up? I was just in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop by and say hello. You, uh, wanna come in, or Uh, sure. Thanks. You know, I'd offer you a-- a beer or something, but-- No, no. No, I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm fine, thanks. You, uh, didn't wind up moving, I see. Didn't have to. Saul told me what you did. Anyways, uh, I'm not in jail. You aren't either, so there you go. There was no other option, Jesse. It had to be done. I'm not coming back. I know. So why are you here, exactly? [Chuckles.] It's funny. I I saw a Bounder the other day. - Bounder? - Yeah. Our RV? A Bounder? Oh. Oh. Oh, you saw the same one as ours? Yeah. Well, within a couple years, I guess. Early '80s. It was certainly in a lot better shape than our old hunk of junk. A much nicer paint job. No bullet holes in the door. Yeah. That thing was a nightmare, huh? Oh, it was primitive. You know, whenever I hit a red light, I used to pray it wouldn't crap out on me. Yeah. And then, suddenly, it would sometimes have that-- that screeching sound that just-- out of the blue, like we hit a pack of cats. Power steering belt. That's what that was. I always had this-- this whole system-- strategy-- to not let it idle too low. Remember that time we ran out of gas coming back from a cook? Ah, the gauge. The gauge always said half-full, so Yeah, you had to walk three miles with a jerry can while I waited on the side of the road, praying the whole time that no cop would show up, no good samaritan. God. We had money. Why'd we keep it? Why did we have to have the world's shittiest RV? - Inertia? - Yeah. Yeah. Inertia. So, hey, um, you know, I gotta get going. - Yeah. No, me too. - I'm just meeting up with some friends, and-- I gotta get going as well. I left something for you. [Car door opens, closes.] [Engine starts.] [Car departing.] [Panting.] [Door opens.] [Door closes.] Hey. I'm out. I'm out. [Marie.] With some big earrings, it could be really nice. Perhaps some big hoops. I feel like I just want to mix it up with my hair this summer. - You know, like color [Hank.] - Yeah. I don't know. [Walt.] Did you have a coin collection? I had coins. have the time to do hobbies. Coins and baseball cards. Those were the ones. You can play around with it and take them in and out Not enough hours in the day, right? - Not enough hours [Marie.] - My hairstylist told me to take prenatal vitamins. For your hair? He said they work, so I figure why not? Oh, uh, Flynn, could you put some more sunscreen on Holly? Yeah. Is it over there? - Yeah, it's right here. - Okay. for a home brew, though. Papa-free. That's good. - Although I don't know why it would be bad. - Yeah. I know. Me neither. Oh, do you-- I used to squeeze lemon juice in my hair. You remember that? You wanted to be a beach bum so badly. - I did. - Ohh. You and your stiff hair. [Groaning.] - Stiff what? - Hey, hey. I was interested to see you get into that. - Borage oil is supposed to be good. - It's like chemistry. - Is it really? Better than flaxseed? - I don't know. That's cool. I like your style. There is no Christmas. There is no Christmas Maybe I should brew up a batch. - What do you think? - Ooh, Schraderbrau? - Yeah. - I vote yes. I second that. Well, there you go. It's unanimous. Well, who am I to fly in the face of public demand, right? [Chuckling.] All right. Hold on. [Grunts.] Anybody, uh-- anybody want anything? Want anything? No, I'm good. I'm good, thank you. All right. Does it look glossier? - Do I have a halo? - I don't know. - How's she doing? - She's good. - I used to have that halo. - Yeah. [Conversation continues, faint.] [Sighs.] Ahhh. [Cracks knuckle.] [Sighs.] [Hank's voice.] "To W.W., my star, my perfect silence." [Chuckles.] W.W. [Chuckling.] I mean, who do you figure that is, you know? Woodrow Wilson? Willy Wonka? Walter White? [Chuckles.] You got me.
