Previously on Dexter: If I do happen to find her, you'll get your reward money.
Ah, shit.
Who's that? Federal marshal.
Dexter Morgan, what the hell are you doing here? Arlene's a friend.
We met through Hannah.
It's not safe for you to go back to the hotel.
You need something private.
What the fuck? It's only for a couple of nights.
Couple of nights? That's it.
Sorry I'm not Deb.
She's always accusing me of comparing you to her.
Welcome back to Homicide, detective.
I just need some time to think about it.
Take all the time you need.
There's no life for me here in Florida.
I can have a life somewhere else far away from here-- In Argentina.
Maybe we all can.
Yes.
Me, you, and Harrison are gonna move to Argentina.
Zach's killer is related to you.
The Brain Surgeon is related to you.
I had two sons, Daniel and Richard.
My older son, Daniel He killed Richard.
Then we put Daniel into a mental health institute.
That guy Cassie was dating Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.
Suppose you do find him, Dexter.
What are you going to do? He's murdered four innocent people, and he killed Zach Hamilton.
He's my son.
He got away.
That's why I'm here, to warn you.
I think it best, from here on out, that I handle this myself.
Vogel is on her own, and so am I.
I'll kill Saxon and leave Miami forever.
So now do you believe me? Yes.
Feels good to cook for you again.
It reminds me of what it was like to be your mother.
You think fixing breakfast makes you my mother again? No.
You gave up that privilege a long time ago.
Daniel, whatever mistakes I've made in the past, I want to make it up to you.
I can help you.
Help me how? I can arrange for the care you need.
The care I need? I will never be locked up again.
I have contacts at the best facilities.
Like the last one you sent me to? Do you know what that was like? Day after day wondering when you'd finally come to visit, only to realise that the answer was never.
Daniel, I couldn't.
You'd killed Richard.
That was your fault.
You ignored me.
All you ever cared about was Richard.
You never tried to help me.
I was young, inexperienced.
I didn't know how to help you.
But you sure as hell knew how to help Dexter Morgan.
You taught him how to deal with his condition.
You gave him everything you denied me.
While I was rotting away, you gave him a life.
I know that.
I do.
It was a horrible mistake.
I was your son.
I needed you.
Please Please what? Let me help you.
I'm sorry for everything I've done.
I truly, truly am.
I wish I could believe you.
Hannah.
Hey, Harrison.
Oh, I missed you.
Aw.
Hey, soon you'll be able to spend all the time you want with her, but right now, Hannah and I need to have a grown-up talk.
Okay, bud? Okay.
So some potentially good news.
Yeah? Deputy Marshal Clayton stopped by my place.
It seems like he's backing off on his search for you.
Oh, that's a huge relief.
Even so, he managed to get your face all over the news.
You still need to lay low.
So how am I gonna get out of Miami? Well, no one's looking for a woman travelling with her husband and child.
I'm thinking the three of us could leave together.
I like the sound of that.
There's still so much to do.
I've gotta tell Batista I'm leaving, get Harrison out of school, see Astor and Cody one last time.
I need to list my condo, sell my boat, my car.
Deb can help out with all that stuff.
Wow.
Heh, heh.
We're really gonna do it.
Yeah.
We're moving to Argentina.
God, that was always such a fantasy, I never thought that it would actually happen.
Otherwise I would have learned Spanish.
We'll learn together.
We'll be leaving soon.
I have to kill Saxon first.
Oh, so you are gonna go through with it.
I have to.
Vogel's not thinking clearly.
She doesn't seem to realise she's in danger.
I feel like I need to protect her.
You feel like you need to? Yeah.
What? Oh, it's just when it comes to you and killing, feelings never enter the equation.
She needs me to protect her.
Hey! Stay off Aunt Deb's treadmill.
But it's fun.
No, it's not for kids.
Hey, come here.
I wanna hear about what you've been doing for the last eight months.
Okay.
Hi, Aunt Deb.
Hi.
Come on.
Can we talk? What the hell is Harrison doing with Hannah? Deputy marshal pulled off the detail.
It's not safe for Harrison to be at the apartment as long as Saxon's still out there.
Okay, then I'll watch him, but he shouldn't be with her.
That's not fucking fair to him.
I have to tell you something.
What? Harrison and I are leaving soon.
What do you mean, you're leaving? You're leaving where? Leaving Miami with Hannah.
What are you talking about? We're moving to Argentina.
Are you kidding? You know how stupid that sounds? Deb-- You're gonna take your fucking son, move to another country with a wanted fugitive? Have you fucking thought this through? Deb, I have.
We wanna have a life together.
I wish there was a different way, but there's not.
We need to leave the country and start someplace new.
You act like this doesn't even affect me.
I know it does.
Well, then, that's a really selfish decision on your part.
We'll still see each other.
I'll come up here, and you can visit.
Okay, I'll look you up the next time I'm in Argentina.
Deb, I'm sorry.
This is hard for me too.
Hey.
How was your day? Long.
Aww.
Well, I had a really good day.
Not only am I about to graduate, but I got a recruitment letter from Greenwood Academy.
A therapist position.
What's Greenwood Academy? It's a very well respected special-needs school in Atlanta.
They want to set up an interview.
That's fucking great.
When you going? I'm not.
What do you mean? Why not? Joey, I'm not moving to Atlanta when you're here.
I'll find something in Miami.
I'm just so flattered that they're interested.
Jamie, I would feel like shit if I was the cause of you missing out on a great opportunity.
You shouldn't.
This is my decision.
All I'm saying is, you know, you should do what's best for your career.
What about us? Don't worry about us, you know? We'll make it work.
Be right back.
I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Evelyn.
Tom.
Please.
Everything okay? Yes, fine.
A little over-worked, so Mm.
Thanks for coming in this morning.
As I said, it's kind of a sensitive matter.
It's about one of your patients.
Zach Hamilton.
As I'm sure you're aware, he's gone missing.
Yes.
I was hoping he'd turned up by now.
He hasn't.
And I promised his parents that I would look into it personally.
But I'm afraid I've hit a dead end.
Tom, you know that I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients.
Come on, Evelyn, I'm trying to help this kid.
Now, he lived at home.
How was his relationship with his parents? Like anyone his age.
Did he say anything about trying to get away? He talk about any friends, maybe a special girl? Was he into drugs? Gambling? Was he suicidal? I don't know.
Look, I know you understand better than anyone what it's like to lose a child.
Not knowing is even worse.
Imagine how the Hamiltons must feel.
I wish I could help, but I just don't know any more.
I'm sorry, but I have another appointment.
Saxon killed his brother when he was only 14.
Killed seven more in the fire when he was 17.
How many more since then? He's lived in a dozen cities across two continents.
Never been arrested.
Never leaves a trace.
Is he the perfect psychopath I once was? Dr.
Vogel.
Dexter.
Can we talk? What are you doing here? Tom wanted to question me about Zach.
Well, of course, I couldn't tell him anything.
But I feel horrid keeping Zach's death from the Hamiltons.
And we both know that Zach's killer is still out there.
Understand, Evelyn, you are in danger.
Well, you don't have to worry.
My son isn't gonna harm me.
How do you know that? I just do.
Have you been in contact with him? I saw him.
When? We had breakfast yesterday.
Where is he now? I have no idea.
Evelyn It's the truth.
He-- He was angry and he stormed out of the house.
I don't know whether I'll ever see him again.
Why didn't you tell me? Because you want to kill him.
And I don't want that to happen.
I can't turn my back on him again.
What is there you can do for him? Well First, I can establish trust.
I wasn't a good mother to him when he was a child.
I need to win him over.
And then Well, eventually, hopefully, I'll get him back into a facility.
And how many more innocent people will he kill before you do that, before he kills you? If you won't protect yourself, I need to do it.
I don't want you to protect me, Dexter.
I don't want you to be a hero.
Evelyn, I have to-- Please.
Don't use me as an excuse for killing Daniel.
She doesn't want my help.
So do I just walk away from this? We could leave for Argentina tonight.
Dexter, you don't want to leave this unfinished.
I don't even know how to find him.
You always find a way.
If you don't kill Saxon, her life is at risk.
Crime scene.
You can send it back, you know.
It's not the salad.
So you asked me here to watch me eat? You can't tell anybody this, okay? Dexter is leaving Miami.
Why? He's quitting? He and Harrison are gonna take the rest of the year and travel.
Fucking A.
Good for him.
Or not.
I don't know if he's ever coming back, you know.
I mean, I get wanting a change, but-- Sometimes, you know, when things don't feel right, changing it up is better for everyone involved.
It's not better for me.
He's my brother.
I don't want him to leave.
I understand, but maybe you should think about what's best for him.
Look, when I left New York, it was one of the toughest things I ever did, leaving my friends and family.
But as it turns out, finally being on my own was the best thing I ever did for myself.
Batista gave me my badge back.
Fucking A, that's great.
Or not.
It's good.
It's good.
I've wanted to come back for a long time, so You tell Elway? Not yet.
You know what this means, right? You and me, side by side.
Just like old times.
Seriously? Yeah.
It's a crime scene.
Gotta go.
No, I got it, I got it.
Okay.
Next one's on me, partner.
Nothing will change after I'm gone.
Blood will continue to pool.
I just won't be here to photograph it.
The guy was hit pretty hard.
Major head wounds, lots of broken bones, internal injuries.
Road rage.
The guy on the bike wouldn't get out of the way, gave him the finger, so the driver ran him over.
Lieutenant, can I get a word? Sure.
Hey, Dex.
I didn't know I had to work today.
Why would you think that? Because it's Saturday.
Are you high? You're high, aren't you? I can smell it on you.
Go home.
Dad We'll talk about this later.
Go.
And stop smoking pot.
You have every right to tell me what to do at work, but you have no right to tell me what to do at home.
Well, that's-- That's a huge shock, Dexter.
I know it seems like it's out of the blue, but after Rita's death and with the job, I've just had enough death in my life for a while.
I need a break, so This is my notice.
You need this, don't you? I wish you nothing but the best.
Thank you.
I'd like to keep this between us.
I'd like to let other people know myself, Jamie included.
She's gonna take it hard.
You know, she really loves Harrison.
He loves her too.
Anyway, she's moving on herself.
New job soon.
Maybe this'll make it easier.
I'll miss you, bro.
Hey, listen, and If you change your mind, you always have a home here.
Got it.
Okay.
He said, "I'm too big for a nap," and then he went right to sleep.
Heh.
Cute.
So are you any closer in your search for Saxon? Not really.
I don't know much about him.
He moves around a lot.
I guess he figures if you stay in one place too long Eventually you get caught.
I wish we could just leave.
Yeah, me too, but I know that you have to protect Dr.
Vogel.
Actually, she doesn't want me to.
Then why are you doing this? Because it's what I do.
It's who I am.
It's all I know.
Dexter, you're more than that.
Am I? You think that when we move to Argentina that it's possible for you and me to have a fresh start? Yes.
Well, then, the sooner you kill Saxon, the sooner we can get there.
Vogel is the key.
I'm sure he'll go for her.
But I can't just sit and watch her.
Especially if she figures out that you're watching her.
That can make things worse.
I need to find him, but maybe I don't need Vogel.
Just her computer.
I want you to see something.
Get in.
I'm not gonna hurt you, Mom.
Trust me, if I wanted you dead, I wouldn't be holding this door.
Do you recognise this from the video I sent you? This is where you kill your victims.
Why did you bring me here? To help you understand.
Have a seat.
Don't worry, I wiped it down after every, uh-- Well This room is more than what you think it is.
It's a reminder.
Of what? Where you sent me.
I've made it look exactly like what they called our treatment room.
When I would refuse to take my meds, the doctors would strap me down into a chair like this and they would force the meds down.
And that was usually the highlight of my day.
You can see why I caused that fire.
I can see why you would do anything to get out of a place like this.
You said before that you wanted to help me.
Yes.
I'd like that.
Most facilities aren't like this, Daniel.
I could put you someplace where you'd be very comfortable.
I could see you every day.
I want you to help me like you helped Dexter.
I want you to show me how to exist free in the world just the way I am.
As a killer? Daniel, I can't help you to murder innocent people.
If you care about me the way you say you do, you'll figure out a way to make this work.
I want to be someone you can love.
I'm asking you, as your son please help me.
All right, I'll find a way.
What about Dexter? He's still after me.
I'll talk to Dexter.
Don't make the same mistake you made with Richard.
Choose right this time.
Choose me.
I'll get Dexter to understand.
Do you think that's possible? I'll make it possible.
I want this, Daniel.
I want to be your mother again.
I'll do whatever it takes.
Vogel told me where she keeps a spare key in case of an emergency.
I think protecting her from her deranged son qualifies.
Saxon installed spyware on her computer.
Thing is, that can go both ways.
So if Saxon can see Vogel's computer Then I can see Saxon's.
So, what are you looking for? Something, anything that can give me an edge.
What's this? That's the video he sent to Vogel.
And this one's from last week.
No, don't! Zach.
No, no! What are you doing? No! No! No! Dexter, if something happens to Evelyn, it will haunt you forever.
You can't just run off to Argentina and escape who you are.
I'm not trying to escape anything.
So you'll post a job listing next week? Great.
Listen, I just don't need any forensic tech.
Hey, I need the best out there.
He's filling some big shoes.
I appreciate it.
Sorry, deputy.
How can I help you? Just came by to let you know none of our leads on Hannah McKay panned out.
You know, when the trail goes cold at this point, the subject either was never here, or skipped town pretty fast.
So, what does that mean? It means the case is back to low priority.
Okay.
Thanks for the heads up.
Uh-- I couldn't help overhearing.
You said you're looking for a new forensic tech.
You know someone? No, I'm just curious-- Who's leaving? It's not Dexter Morgan, is it? Close the door.
He hasn't told any of his friends yet, so this is on the QT, but, yes, Dexter's moving on.
He got a better job, huh? No, he's going to travel, spend time with his son.
Really? Yeah.
I can't say I blame him.
Hey, babe.
How was your day? It was okay.
You working? Yeah, I'm just sending out rÃ©sumÃ©s.
I'm almost done though.
Hey, um, can we talk for a sec? Okay.
I feel like an asshole, but I gotta be honest with you.
Okay, so be honest.
It's not working out between us, is it? Is that a question? No.
It's-- I'm sorry.
Then why did you let me move in here? I mean, why wait until now, Joey? I hoped it would make things better.
I don't know what else to say.
Ugh, I am so stupid to think you would ever get over Deb.
It's got nothing to do with Deb.
I thought you wanted to be honest with me.
I am.
This is on me.
She's got nothing to do with it.
Joey, see, that is what hurts the most.
That you just keep lying about it.
I'm not lying, Jamie.
Okay, you know what? Don't worry.
I'm gonna move my stuff out of here as soon as I can, so you're free to not go back to Deb.
Jamie-- Bye.
Just give me a sec.
Hey.
I don't want to intrude.
Well, it's your house.
It's your family.
It's your family too.
I want you and Harrison to be happy.
So how do you feel about us leaving? Scared.
My whole family's moving.
Scared? You've always been there.
I don't know what my life looks like without you.
Well, maybe it looks better.
Really? Hanging out with two serial killers, does it get better than that? So you see my point.
I don't know.
Better or worse you've always been there.
Moving on without you feels like jumping off a cliff.
I know what you mean.
Come on.
Will you? Hey, look who's here.
Hi.
Hi.
Just checking in.
All is well here.
Harrison's playing outside with Deb.
Oh, good.
You doing okay? Yeah, I just wanted to hear your voice.
I have to go.
Evelyn.
Dexter.
I was hoping we could talk.
Okay.
I've been rethinking what I said earlier, and I fear I was being too judgemental.
I think it's possible that you and Hannah could have a relationship.
Really? And I think moving far away, beginning anew might be the best thing for you.
Moving far away? Is that the important part? You mentioned Argentina? That could be a good place.
Why do you want me to leave? Dexter, I think there's hope for Daniel.
I don't think he likes killing.
I could help him, but I'm not gonna get that chance if you kill him.
So just leave, please.
Leave Miami.
You don't think he likes killing? He says he wants my help.
Let me show you how much he doesn't like killing.
No, don't! No! No.
That's Zach's head he's sawing into.
There's no hope for him, Evelyn.
This is the same person who killed your younger son.
He will never change.
Don't.
I'm sorry.
So, what now? You know what needs to happen.
Otherwise, he'll go on killing.
Where is he now? He said he would call me tonight.
Set up a meeting with him tonight.
Someplace public, safe.
Call me and let me know where.
I'll follow him and take it from there.
Just please don't let him suffer.
I won't.
Debra Morgan.
Do I know you? Deputy U.
S.
Marshal Max Clayton.
And this is Harrison.
Hey, buddy.
Hi.
You guys have met? Over at his dad's, yeah.
Harrison, why don't you go inside? I'll be there in a minute.
Okay.
Elway gave me your address.
I thought it better we talk in person.
Okay.
Look, I'm worried about your brother.
Dexter? Why? It's probably nothing, but it just struck me as odd that he's leaving town at the exact time Hannah McKay is rumoured to be here.
How do you know he's leaving? Uh, overheard at the station.
Maybe it's nothing, but are he and Arlene Shram a couple? I don't know.
I don't keep up with his dating life.
Okay, it's just I know he used to have a relationship with Hannah McKay.
What if he still does? Then he's a fucking idiot.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Look, I know I'm going out on a limb here, but what if these two somehow reconnected? I mean, his life could be at risk.
His son's too.
Dexter wouldn't do that.
I hope not.
I don't need to tell you what a dangerous person Hannah McKay is.
You know more about her than I do.
If Dexter were dating Hannah McKay, I would fucking know about it.
Maybe he'd keep it from you.
Who knows? I mean, men do stupid things for beautiful women.
Logic just flies out the window.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but that's not what's happening here.
Dexter's burned out, that's why he's leaving.
Okay.
Thank you.
I respect your opinion.
Here's my card.
You call me if you think of anything.
Okay, I will do.
Hey.
You guys hungry? Yea h! Hey, go clean up, Harrison.
Is everything okay? Not really.
Something happen? Deputy Marshal Clayton happened.
He was just questioning me on the beach.
I thought that Dexter said that Clayton was backing off.
Somehow he found out that Dexter's leaving, and it tweaked him.
He thinks Dexter's helping you hide.
Oh, God.
I covered for both of you, but you have got to stay hidden until you leave.
Of course.
Yes.
Oh Thank you for protecting me, again.
Who knew I'd be so good at it? We'll all be out of here soon.
I know.
I have lunch.
No, thanks.
I have someplace I need to be.
Hey.
Hey.
Can we talk? Nothing to talk about.
I know why you're here.
I'll have your last cheque drawn.
I was gonna give you two weeks.
Don't want your two weeks.
I still have friends in Miami Metro, they said you were going back.
Well, shouldn't we talk about this? I went out of my way to make this work.
I put up with your bullshit.
The more I gave, the more you pushed back.
It's quite clear to me that it was never gonna work out.
Well, I'm sorry.
I really appreciate the job and everything that you've done for me.
Don't mention it.
Let's just, uh Okay.
I'm gonna go pack up my office.
I'll have security do that.
They'll deliver it to your house.
And all the case files are mine, of course.
Including those on Hannah McKay.
Good luck to you.
Yeah, you too.
Harrison, remember what your dad said.
That's not a toy.
But Aunt Deb does it all the time.
Harrison, please listen.
I am.
Ow! Harrison! Ow! Ow! Ow! I know.
It's gonna be okay.
Ow.
I know it hurts.
I know it hurts.
It's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Ow.
Here, hold that.
Ouch.
Ow.
Dexter Morgan.
Dexter, call me.
We're gonna have to take you somewhere and get you patched up.
What happened? He fell and hit his chin.
It's a pretty deep cut.
It won't stop bleeding.
I'll let the doctor know.
Are you the mother? Are you the mother? Uh, yes.
I'm just waiting for his father to call me back.
Fill this out.
Okay.
And wait for us to call his name.
Okay.
Thank you.
Harrison, you're being so brave.
I can't wait to tell your dad.
Harrison Morgan? Uh, yeah.
Here.
Been a while since we've been here.
Choir director.
Long time ago.
Saxon's first victim.
And his last victims.
It's also been a while since you've used victims' pictures.
He needs to see what he's done.
That was always very important to you.
People get what they deserve.
At least they should.
Huh.
I've come a long way.
It feels like I'm a different person from the last time I was in this room.
You're still you, Dexter.
I hope you realise that.
Why wouldn't I? I just don't want you to have any unrealistic expectations about whatever happens next.
I know exactly what happens next.
I kill Saxon.
And then Hannah and Harrison and I get on a plane and start our new lives.
Hey, Jamie.
Go fuck yourself.
What? Debra, come on in.
I'm ready to come back, if you'll have me.
If I'll have you? Are you sure about this? You're not fooling me? Uh, I don't think so.
Well, in that case, hallelujah.
Can you start today? I was thinking more like a week or two.
Of course.
Loose ends.
Yeah, something like that.
Mm-hm.
Well, whenever you're ready, I'm ready.
It's funny, though.
What? You coming back as Dexter's leaving.
He told you? Yeah.
And, yeah, don't worry about Jamie.
What was that? Oh, you don't know? Quinn just ended things with her.
Stupid idiot.
He did? And so you know, Jamie kind of blames you.
Yeah, I get that.
Yeah, she thinks Quinn is still in love with you or something like that.
I didn't want to know the details.
I'll let you have at him first.
We need to talk.
I just did what-- Not here.
Did you break up with her because of me? No.
Yes.
I mean, no and yes.
Don't get all mad.
Your face gets red when you get mad.
No, it doesn't.
What the fuck happened? It's not complicated.
I wasn't happy.
I mean, I was okay, but I kind of knew I was never gonna marry her.
Probably would have ended it soon anyway, even if what happened between you and I didn't happen.
Nothing happened.
We shared a kiss.
That's not a reason to fucking break up with somebody.
You're not hearing me.
I probably would have broke up with Jamie, but what happened between you and I just made it clear that I shouldn't be with her anymore.
Got it? Yes.
So, yeah, to be completely honest, I still have feelings for you, But I don't expect anything from you.
Why not? Because I didn't think you wanted-- I still have feelings for you, stupid.
That didn't change, I just-- I wasn't sure that I saw a future for us.
What about now? I don't know.
I mean, I used to I used to feel like something was holding me back, but now-- Now I just-- Shh.
Are you sure it was Hannah McKay you saw earlier today? Yeah.
I'd seen her picture on the news.
She brought in her son.
He had a cut on his chin.
Hannah McKay doesn't have any children.
Are you sure this is her? Well, I think so.
What was her boy's name? His name was Harrison Morgan, and she sure acted like he was her own.
I fell on my chin.
Yeah, how many stitches are holding that chin together? Six.
Wow.
I bet that hurt.
Yeah, but Harrison was very brave.
I even got a lollipop.
Can I go play now? Yeah, sure.
Thanks for taking care of him.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I feel awful.
I can't believe I wasn't here for you.
You went out in public.
You put yourself in jeopardy because I was setting up a kill room.
Dex, you didn't know.
It doesn't matter.
I'm trying to save Dr.
Vogel when I should be taking care of you and Harrison.
We're okay, really.
It's fine.
But there is one other thing.
What? That deputy marshal came by.
Here? He talked to Deb.
I think she put him off, but still, we can't stay here for much longer.
I know.
Evelyn? Dexter, he's here.
Here? Where's here? At my house.
He called me.
Said he was a couple of blocks away.
No, that wasn't the plan.
You were supposed to meet him someplace in public.
