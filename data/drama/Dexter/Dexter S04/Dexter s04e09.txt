- previously on dexter Judging from the spray, we're looking at somebody tall.
Over six feet.
He moved the arm for a reason.
- the killer leaves the ash as his signature, Making his vics point at it.
Lundy came to miami to hunt this guy.
I think he got too close and i think It got him killed and me shot.
- it's been my dad's baby for years.
A few days ago, he hands me the keys.
- no, no.
Smooth circular motions, son.
- i got it, dad.
- if you got it, i wouldn't have to remind you.
- small cracks in the perfect family.
- i can lose my job.
Not like i'm the only one.
Being a journalist these days Is like a straight ticket to the unemployment line.
Either i get a lead that bleeds or basically i'm done.
Are the sweeps connected to the shootings of agent lundy? - i know it's really tough for reporters right now.
So maybe instead of this one, i can give you That interview you've been wanting from me.
Mother shit fuck.
How tall was my shooter? - my height.
- then it wasn't trinity.
- nope.
- i was a dress-over-the-head party girl.
You must think i'm-- - totally charming.
- we broke up officially.
- if i find out this is bullshit, There will be severe, career-ending consequences.
- fuck it.
- no more confessions, no more good deeds, And no more fucking remorse.
No, you're mine.
Arthur mitchell, you just got a reprieve.
- this'll do the job.
Cut you into exactly the right size pieces.
You got one more day.
[laughter.]
Happy families are all alike.
They never leave you by yourself on holidays.
- so i got some interesting thanksgiving greetings From your coach davis.
Well, if you're not gonna play baseball anymore, I suppose you aren't gonna need this.
- no, dad-- - all right? How about this? Oh, you're full of awards.
- once the turkey's gone, so is arthur.
- how about this one? This one's for most valuable player.
[car door closes and engine turns.]
- fuck you, dad.
[engine revs and tires screech.]
- family business.
- it's my business too.
- [grunting.]
- okay.
Healthy way to blow off steam.
- [grunts.]
- what the hell? Jonah? Hey, it's just me.
- mr.
butler, what are you doing here? - i stopped by your house.
I saw you arguing with your father.
- no, i don't argue.
i never argue.
- still looked like a bad one.
- man, you have no idea what he's like.
How he treats my mother and rebecca.
You don't know what he's capable of.
- well, actually-- - he hits me.
- that's not right.
- you know, i'm running out of cliches to tell the coaches.
You know, "hey, i fell down some stairs.
I walked into a door.
" I know it looks like we have the perfect fucking family, But in that house, when he's there, It's not a life.
It's a tour of duty.
Shit.
He'd kill me if he knew i was telling you this stuff.
- i won't say a word.
- you should have just let him die.
- where you going? - anywhere away from here.
I can't go back.
Not to him.
not with the car like this.
- so i'll go with you.
I'll be there when you tell him.
- why? - you're not the only one with father issues.
- well, you know, maybe I mean, i guess if you came to thanksgiving tomorrow, Dad would be on his best.
- thanksgiving? - dinner's at 1:00.
I can stay at luke's house until then.
- guess i'm having two turkey dinners this year.
The dna sweep didn't give them trinity.
But it did bring in a cornucopia of criminals.
That should keep miami metro off the trinity case Through the holiday.
Deb won't be anywhere near as easy.
- i'm sorry, dex, but i'm spending thanksgiving With 90 or so of my newest friends.
Look at these victims.
It looks like a family portrait.
The bathtub women, they're always young and single.
A first girlfriend maybe.
And then the jumper's always a mother of two.
Maybe that represents his mom or his wife, But i don't think this guy's married.
And the bludgeon-ee's always a father.
- you used to love thanksgiving when we were kids.
You wore the little indian headdresses.
Picked the pearl onions out of the green beans.
- yeah, mom's green beans.
And then she died.
And it was you and me and dad and football And tv dinners in aluminum trays.
Talk about your lonely.
- well, you won't be lonely at our house.
You'll never get the chance.
- dexter, i am lead detective On the biggest case of my career.
This is where i belong.
- i thought batista was lead.
- he's the lead on lundy now.
Once we figured out trinity didn't shoot me, There was no conflict for me-- - what? Wait.
Trinity didn't shoot you? - while you were at your rain man convention, Masuka and i put it together form the bullet's trajectory.
- how did i not see that? - we were too close.
That's what happens when you make it personal.
- [sighs.]
So i've heard.
So who shot you? - maybe trinity knows.
I'll ask him when i haul his ass in here.
- deb, you really, really need to come to thanksgiving.
- tell the family i said, "hi.
" - all right, heads up, everybody.
This dna sweep has been like christmas.
We got hits on three open rape cases And one open burglary case.
But best of all, hits on two homicides.
Merry thanksgiving, soderquist.
And this one is mine.
Keep up the good work, guys.
- sarge, any news on any other cases? - we'll find the fucker who shot you.
You know that.
Focus on what you can control.
- catching trinity.
- catching trinity.
[knocks on door.]
I heard the aclu's filing suit on the sweeps.
- we've got maybe 72 hours till we're shut down for good.
We'll just have to keep pushing harder.
- well, the holidays may slow us down.
We'll have a skeleton crew.
- i'll be here.
Never been much for family holidays anyway.
- particularly when they're all still in cuba.
- particularly.
You with auri tomorrow? - she's with her moms this year.
Plus i have a chance to close an old case of mine, so - so i guess we'll both be working thanksgiving.
- together.
- how unfortunate.
- put it up higher, mom.
- no, i want it lower.
- are happy families all alike? - much better.
- dexter's home.
- oh, good.
They didn't run out of pies.
- here you go.
- [giggles.]
- okay, bird, confess.
How big are you? - 22 pounds.
- that's a lot of bird.
- better too much than not enough.
I mean, that's what the holiday's about.
That and family.
- about tomorrow - uh-oh.
- it's not a big deal.
But the monroe county p.
d.
needs a spatter interpretation On a bar fight and their blood guy's in the bahamas.
- [sighs.]
- should just take a few hours.
- does it have to be tomorrow? - well, that's when the reconstruction is.
- mm.
- plus i'll be making triple overtime.
- sure, that's a plus, But you'll be missing all the fun.
- yeah.
- poor you.
poor us.
At least elliot will be here.
- yeah, good old elliot.
- so is deb coming? - she's on the fence.
[sighs.]
- no, tell her that this is our first family thanksgiving And that we're establishing traditions That will shape our kids and that they'll pass on To their kids and that she's a part of that.
An important part of that.
[grunts.]
[sighs.]
- rather than me tell her all that Okay, guys, now look real sad.
I mean, really miserable.
And Action.
[cell phone beeps.]
- hi, aunt deb.
We just heard that you might not come To thanksgiving dinner, and well-- - we really want you to come.
- look sad, retard.
- all right, all right.
Just take two.
- will you please come over? - fuck me.
[sighs.]
You're here late.
- ah, didn't even notice.
- big plans tomorrow? - [chuckles.]

Whatever about tomorrow, right? It's just another day where people eat turkey.
I can eat turkey any day of the year.
- dexter's having people over.
Well, me.

I'll let rita know.
- [exhales.]

- ah, it's just a casual thanksgiving With your girlfriend.
- girlfriend? That sounds really serious.
- joey I don't want to spend it alone.
[chuckles.]
Plus, uh I make the best pecan pie in the state of florida.

Hey, dex.
- howdy, pilgrim.
- did you hear that the pilgrims didn't eat turkey On the first thanksgiving? - really? - they ate corn and eel, which the native americans Taught them to plant and fish.
- then the pilgrims slaughtered them all, Took their food, and went to church the next day To thank god for all their good luck.
- mm, it's a phase.
don't worry about it.
