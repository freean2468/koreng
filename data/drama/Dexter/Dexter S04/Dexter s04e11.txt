You were the first reporter on scene at 5:20.
I'm telling you she knows more than she's letting on.
- suspicious, but it doesn't prove a thing.
- how's this for outside the box? Christine's the same height as the shooter.
- you out of your fuckin' mind? No way christine had anything to do With shooting you or lundy! - you've been dating her for, what, two months? How well do you even fuckin' know her? - the dna results on christine hill are back.
- she's fucking related to trinity.

- so do i.
I think christine has her own secret life.

Please Don't let that hide the fact That you could be in real trouble here.

In a very happy turn of events, Ten-year-old scott smith Was reunited with his parents earlier today.
Although police have no leads as to who abducted the boy Or how he came to be returned, His family is simply happy he's home.
- interesting.
- authorities say they will continue their investigation.
- with all the dna samples from my sister's sweep, There should be one bad guy I can cast in the role of trinity.
But i'm striking out.
- hello.
- let me ask you a question.
What kind of a man Witnesses a child abduction And doesn't call the police? Who are you, kyle? What is it you want? - money.
- money? Is that what all this is about? - i want $50,000, Or i'll tell the whole world That arthur mitchell, family man, Schoolteacher, church deacon, Is a pedophile.
- i am most certainly not a pedophile.
- 50,000.
right now.

Sell your car.
i really don't care.
I want the money today.

I'm not even in miami.
- where are you? - well, i'm not gonna tell you that, am i, kyle? - it doesn't matter.
You have 24 hours to get me the money.
- i'll, uh-- i'll be in touch.

More than you should.
And you share trinity's dna.

But you're in here Until you tell us what we need to know.
- you can't do that.
You can only hold me for 48 hours.
- if you were under arrest.
But we're holding you as a material witness.
- so you can keep me as long as you want.
- that's right, So you better start talking, bitch.
- she says she doesn't know anything.
- and, what, you believe her? I know this sucks for you, But she's in there because she's involved, So get your fuckin' head on straight.
- we don't have any proof.
- come on, quinn.

You both lied under oath.
You committed perjury, and that's a felony.

- i figured.
that's for me.
- you put some kind of drug in there to make me talk? - you watch way too much tv.
I get it, why you did what you did.
To protect your dad.
I would have done the same thing.

Actually, we weren't.
I wanted us to be, But he never noticed.
He was always too busy with my brother and work.
- is that why you became a cop? - yes, actually.
- hmm.
You thought that maybe, Just maybe, if you became a cop like him, He'd give you that approval You'd been so hungry for? - well, when you say it like that, It sounds like a giant cliche.
- that's because it is.
I don't want to talk about your daddy issues, okay? - fine.
Let's talk about yours.
- hmm.
Oh, you don't know anything about me.
- i know you can still do the right thing.
One day, i grew up.
And i realized my father wasn't the end-all, And it didn't matter what he thought of me, Because i realized i didn't think that much Of him anymore either.
- you think just because you shared, I'm gonna open up? You watch too much tv.
- how'd it go? - it didn't.
Now what? - well, her lawyer's insisting that we let her go.
- let who go? - christine.

Arthur.
- i'm standing in front of your house, kyle.
- what? - i called the four walls office For your home address.
Seems to be johnny's jet skis.
- they're fun.
you should try one.
- what this tells me is you've been lying to me From the very beginning.
- well, in the big scheme of things, Being a liar isn't nearly as bad as being a pedophile.
- do not call me that! - i want my $50,000.
Why should i trust you to be silent After i've given you the money? - here's what you can trust.
If you don't meet me with the money, I'll call your family, your school, And then the police.
- give me until tomorrow.
- how do i know i can trust you? - i guess that's just the world we live in, kyle.
? ? - you don't let me out of here, I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass! Aah! you fuck! What the fuck are you doing? - normally, we'd have a little chat.
I'd show you the error of your ways.
But i'm kind of in a hurry here.
- oh, i am gonna fuck you up! - uh-huh.
- i'm gonna rip your heart out! - yeah, i heard.
- i'm gonna gut you like a fuckin' pig! You'll be sorry that you ever crossed me! Aah! - i just need to make sure The police find arthur's dna.
When they see this picture of christine, They'll think she's beaudry's daughter.
Lundy's trinity books.
- thanks.
Only be a minute.
Mine's dead.
Don't have a land line.
- hello.
- daddy.
It's me.
I'm sorry i haven't returned your calls.
I've been - i know where you've been.
Don't call me anymore.
you understand? - d-daddy, i just-- - it's slightly unbelievable that beaudry Would even own a toothbrush, But i'm gonna go for it.
And now, the final piece of the puzzle.
I think i'm done.
Stan beaudry is now the trinity killer.
Love thy neighbor.
Bullshit.
I should leave it alone.
Go inside.
Watch the history channel.
Hey, elliot.
- dex.
- stay the hell away from my wife.
- jesus.
dex Aah.
wow.
okay.
Uh, i guess i deserved that.
Now, now wait.
I know i'm an asshole, But just wait a minute.
I got caught up in a moment.
Rita's amazing.
- you think i don't know that? - and i'm an idiot.
And if i were you, I would want to kill me too.
- don't ever touch her again.
- your hand.
- yousaw? - i saw.
You're not mad? - no.
I'm not mad.
- what are you? - glad.
That you cared that much.
Can't believe you hit him, though.
- i know.
- i didn't see that coming.
- i didn't either.
- professional courtesy dictates We give you a heads up.
- mm-hmm.
we're married.
- as in man and wife.
- well, i don't see how that changes the facts of the matter.
- it's certainly gonna change the context of your accusation.
- do you really want to go in front of the board of review And attack the sacrament of holy matrimony? - the issue here is perjury.
- alleging an affair is one thing, But now you'd be going after us For embracing the bedrock of family values.
- in heavily catholic, And heavily latino miami.
- you'll come across as a soulless, Anti-family schmuck.
- but if that's what you want to do, We'll take the fight.
- it's also worth noting That the chief of police Met his now wife On the job as well.
- you can lecture him On how he is in violation Of department protocol.
- i can only marvel at the level of cynicism.
Using the institution of marriage As a cheap political ploy.
You must be very proud of yourselves For being so clever.
- you didn't give us a lot of options.
- i hope that your life together Will not be as empty and as amoral As your decision to get married was.
- we did the right thing.
- of course we did.
- batista.
Okay.
We just got a lead on the trinity killer.
- according to this, He had a delivery two days ago in jacksonville, And due back here last night.
- yeah, well, i'm guessing christine Found a way to warn him off.
- well, hello, mr.
toothbrush.
- don't forget mr.
comb.
- oh, yeah.
We've got some dna going on in here.
- great.
- dex, That guy that was bludgeoned, You remember the kind of hammer? - uh, it was a grant-- - 24-ounce framing hammer? - we got him.
- it's a little hard to believe this is the same guy That never made a mistake in 30 years.
- ah, i'm sure he made mistakes.
We just weren't looking.
- a truck stop employee Noticed stan beaudry's truck during the night.
Preliminary investigations Reveals evidence pertinent to the trinity killings.
At this point, We're trying to locate mr.
stan beaudry.
He's become our number one suspect.
- stan beaudry? - kyle? - daddy.
- i told you not to call me.
- i'm in trouble, daddy.
The police are - you're putting us both at risk.
- it isn't safe for us to talk.
- i'm on a neighbor's phone.
I would never do anything To put you in danger.
- you already have.
You're a stupid girl! Always getting in the way.
- i was protecting you.
- you've ruined everything.
- i--i did it because i love you.
Just, uh Just, um Meet me.
Please.
I can get past the cops.
- i don't care.
it's not my problem.
- but i need your help.
- you did this to yourself.
You're on your own.
- how could you say that? I'm your daughter.
- i'm sorry, christine.
- i'm sorry too.
- i'm sorry you were ever born.
- dad - do not call me again ever.
- no electric, no water.
Can't track him through his utilities.
- well, someone needs to take a look in here for-- - detective morgan? We just got word that christine hill Would like to speak with you.
Only you.
- fuckin' a.
she wants to confess.
- i'm coming with you.
- joey, come on.
- i'll stay outside.
She won't even know i'm there.
- let's go.
- it hasn't been easy, But i was able to pull together The funds you are demanding, kyle.
- well, that's good news.
That'll make both our lives a lot easier.
- i'll have the money at 7:00.
I'll drop it in the trash container Nearest the lighthouse at cape florida.
- that location doesn't work for me, arthur.
The palmetto marina on the miami river.
Leave it at the entrance to dock c, - you're the boss, kyle.
- glad you understand.
- i'll see you in 15 minutes, Because i know exactly where that music is coming from, And why you're there-- Unfinished business.
- christine, it's detective morgan.
Open up.

Maybe then he'll love me.
" You know what i did? I shot you.
I killed lundy.
- okay.
- i'm so sorry.
- let's just get you to the station.
- can you forgive me? - are you kidding me? I came here to do a job.
I came here to take you in And to get justice for lundy, But forgive you? Fuck you.
Let's just get to the station.
Wait.
no, don't! don't! - what happened? - quinn, don't.
- i've searched the entire fucking arcade.
Where are you, arthur? Hey, deb.
- where are you? - just taking care of business.
What's up? - trinity's daughter just confessed to everything.
And then killed herself.
In front of me.
- are you okay? - i'm in one piece.
Could really use some family right about now, And you're it.
- who am i right now? Dexter morgan, serial killer, Or dexter morgan, brother? I'm on my way.
I need to be a good brother now So that i can be a good serial killer later.
- excuse me.

Mm, sorry.
There's no one by that name.
