Previously on dexter - dexter.
- how's my favorite serial-killer hunter? - the reason i'm in miami is because i'm convinced That these bathtub murders are connected To a series of murders all over the country.
It's always the same three kills with trinity.
You got woman in a bathtub, Followed by a mother falling to her death - you're next.
- if this is the latest victim of lundy's trinity killer, Then he's a very different monster than i am.
- lundy has this theory-- - you don't work for lundy.
You're welcome to pursue this, But between the vacation murders and lisa bell, I think you're gonna be very busy.
- yes, i did come to miami to follow a case, But i have to admit i'm glad the killer chose this city, Knowing i'd find you here.
- hey, good news! The sandpiper hotel wants to book my band For a one-month gig.
Best of all it means no more time away from you.
- wow, that's great.
- i'm not gonna tell you who to date.
It's none of my business.
But you should know there's no such thing As "off the record" with reporters.
So watch the pillow talk with that woman.
Super-agent lundy has a hunch That the dead woman is connected to this big serial killer case.
Lundy always gets his man.
- well, so do i.
- [laughs.]
- look, i was a little worried That people will misinterpret.
- let them misinterpret.
I need this as much as you do.
- the past few weeks, you have not been The most present father and husband.
My dark passenger is like a trapped coal miner, Always helping, always letting me know It's still in there, still alive.
[festive music.]
Everyone needs a vacation.
In my case, it's time off for bad behavior.
But i intend to make the most of this family trip That they're taking without me.
- shotgun! - shotgun! - i called it first.
- i called it inside.
- it doesn't count if you call it inside.
- does so! mom! dexter! - how about you switch every hour? - want to trade places? I stay home and You can stuff cousin marlene into some spanx On her wedding day.
- i wish i could, but things are pretty hectic At the station.
- you're not gonna work the whole time, are you? - i'll try not to.
- you can't let yourself get to that boiling point again.
It's not healthy.
And i'd rather not have to lie to the neighbor again If you decide to smash any more security lights.
- i hate that you saw me that way.
- i'm your wife.
I want to know what's going on inside you.
- i don't think you do.
Just recharge your batteries, all right? Enjoy your freedom.
Go wild.
- rightgo wild.
- have fun.
Say, "good-bye, dexter.
" all: good-bye, dexter! - good-bye, dexter! bye-bye.
- the kids left you a present in the kitchen.
- just the thing to melt a father's heart.
Let the good times roll.
[festive music.]
Whoops! Three days.
to recharge my batteries.
'course rita doesn't know i'll be recharging With another woman.
Officer zoey kruger.
Pembroke pines patrol.
Eight months ago, officer kruger's husband and daughter Were killed during a home invasion.
Zoey was shot in the arm and foot.
She survivedobviously.
But there was one person who thought it was zoey herself Who killed her family.
The one person who always knows the truth of a crime-- The blood guy.
[knocking at door.]
- morgan.
good to see a friendly face.
Aren't many around here.
- nice to have an excuse to visit.
Even if i made it up.
- with your caseload, I can't believe you have time to write a paper On feathering in blood swipes.
- i have a small window for Uh, a side project.
I remembered at the spatter conference last spring, You mentioned something about a questionable swipe In a case you were working.
Who was it, cooper? - kruger, and shh-- we don't talk about that.
- zoey's husband-- shot in the stairway.
Her daughter, in her bedroom.
Zoey said she was shot twice Wrestling the shooter's gun from him.
And turned it on him as he fled.
- that blood swipe Belongs to darius rae, A drug dealer zoey roughed up The day before her family was murdered.
According to her, She winged him in her front hallway.
- the feathering is textbook.
Why'd you say it was questionable? - because it's the only blood of rae's Anywhere at the scene.
- interesting.
For my paper.
- my theory? Uh, forget it.
doesn't matter.
- you think she planted the blood herself? - maybe she even provoked That confrontation with darius rae.
- that's where she got his blood.
- also gives her the perfect narrative for the crime.
Rae breaks in looking for retribution, Cop's family becomes collateral damage.
- was darius rae ever arrested? - darius rae was gunned down In a supposedly gang-related incident.
But that's another theory, Another day.
I try not to think about it.
Because if i'm right, There's a monster walking around free.
- with a badge and a gun.
Zoey said she aimed at darius rae But only winged him.
But zoey always hits her targets.
Just ask her husband and daughter.
I'm feeling recharged already.
Monsters come in all shapes and sizes.
Sometimes it's the very people Who are supposed to be protecting us: A cop, a parent, The spatter guy.
- god, close the door, will you? Here's a bludgeoning from july.
- the one we're looking for will be five days After the suicide.
- right.
Here's a middle-aged guy from october - sorry, i thought this was my lab.
- we're hiding from laguerta.
- quinn's reporter fuck buddy has now officially Fucked all three of us.
- "catching the vacation murderer "may not be the department's top priority.
"detectives spent last thursday indulging the pursuits "of retired fbi man hunter Frank lundy.
" It's a good picture.
- i'm guessing that lieutenant laguerta's Open-door policy with me is about to close.
- we've got to narrow down trinity's next move.
- bludgeoning.
Final kill in his cycle? - and he's repeating his pattern from 30 years ago, So if we can find where he bludgeoned back then-- - then maybe we can keep the next trinity victim From becoming the next trinity victim.
- where's masuka? - on vacation? - he's probably in mexico taking a donkey show tour.
- there's a briefing in five minutes.
Agent lundy - my visitor's badge is expired? - sorry.
- crap.
fuck.
I guess we'll have to stake out potential bludgeoning sites On my off hours.
- hey.
I don't want this theory of mine to jeopardize your job.
- i want in on this.
- well, okay then.
- okay then.
- you ever feel like you're this close to nabbing somebody? - sometime in the next 67 hours.
- it's a good feeling.
- oh, my god! I can't believe he posted that.
- you are so busted.
- i'm busted? Okay, it's totally photoshopped.
The point is, it looks real, so - you're busted! [giggles.]
- shh! - i know, i know, My dick's been making some bad decisions.
- so according to quinn's girlfriend, These vacation murders are costing the city a day.
- well, at least the article got the tip line ringing.
Those assholes can't hide With all those eyes on them.
- well, those eyes are on us too.
[sighs.]
- uh-oh.
- whatoh? - that sigh thing you do when, you know, There's something i'm not gonna like.
- i don't do a sigh thing.
- okay, you don't.
What was it that you were gonna say? - [sighs.]
I think we should inform the brass about our relationship.
Look, it's just a formality.
Paperwork.
entirely confidential.
- it's none of their business.
- it's department policy for good reason.
We will catch these killers, And a defense attorney could use the details Of an off-the-books romance between us To sensationalize the case, distract the jury-- - if they find out.
- on a death penalty case.
- okay, they will find out.
But not for a while.
And what would we even report to the brass? - well, that we're seeing each other.
- what does that mean? - what do you think it means? - it means it's new.
We're still figuring it out.
- so this could just be a passing thing.
- no, it's not a passing thing.
- then what is it? - i don't know.
- well, i don't know either.
- i'm confused.
- yeah.
I can see that.
- can we justwait? - fine.
- as a cop, zoey has been to plenty of crime scenes.
She knows what should be there.
And what shouldn't.
No prints in the blood on the door, Which means she wore gloves.
She was still wearing gloves when she shot herself.
But they were gone when the emts arrived.
Where'd you leave those gloves, zoey? - easier to think here, isn't it? Only 52 hours of freedom left.
You sure chose an interesting person to spend it on.
- don't read anything into it.
Zoey was a challenge, that's all.
- a woman who wiped out her own family In order to be free.
- she should have shot herself Instead of her husband and child.
- yeahexcept that doesn't get her free.
Just dead.
- well, she had other options.
- alimony.
visitation.
Trading off holidays-- there go your weekends.
- fine, she could have moved away.
- and forfeit her job, her home? Her only option was to make her vacation from her family As permanent as possible.
- there are always alternatives.
- why do you think trinity's been so successful? - he travels a lot.
Stays on the move.
- he doesn't have a family.
- well, i do.
- miss them yet? - all right, trinity used a hammer In portland and in fresno, But wasn't it a tire iron in albuquerque? Okay, all right.
We'll go with the dude that was pulverized by the hammer.
Where was that? Okay, what time tomorrow? Great.
Pad thai, my favorite.
- mmm.
How's frank lundy? - i didn't say that was lundy.
- oh, your voice did.
It goes up a notch every time you talk to him, Which you're doing a lot of lately.
- your point? - i get a gig in town to spend more time with you.
You spend all your time with your ex.
- our relationship is strictly professional.
- you twist your hair when you talk to him? - you have nothing to be jealous of When it comes to frank lundy.
All right? - poker night at home.
Zoey's police family surrounds her On and off the job.
Between her buddy system and her security system, Her house will be difficult to break in tonight.
But not tomorrow.
- [whistles.]
- [belches.]
- cunt.
- what the hell did you just say? - you're a cunt! - [laughs.]
Fuck off, old man.
- fucking pussy.
[groans.]
- you looking to get the shit kicked out of you? - [whimpers.]
faggot! [whimpers.]
- you gonna shut up now? - faggot.
Faggot.
[grunts.]
[moans.]
It's your fault.
- the fuck is wrong with you? - all your fault.
[coughs.]
- the living room is here to the left, Kitchen in the back, And way out back is the hot tub.
Oh, welcome, welcome, welcome.
Oh, you're gonna love this house.
[laughs.]
Newer construction, only one previous owner, All sorts of upgrades.
Come on, let me show you its special wonders.
- uh, would it be all right If i discovered those special wonders on my own? - any questions, just holler.
- okay.
I do have one question.
Where did zoey stash her gloves? I'm sure they're long gone, But they could have left trace evidence.
She swiped the door with blood here Shoots herself, collapses Crawls toward the kitchen to call 911.
Did she burn them? If the gloves melted, there would be residue On the underside of the grate.
- it's just for show.
Who needs a fire in this climate? I'm zoey.
i live here.
- hey.
- i just thought i'd stop by, See how the open house was going.
- oh.
it's a nice place.
- thanks.
- family friendly.
- mm.
I'll be glad to give you a tour if you're interested.
- very interested.
- okay, follow me.
- wow, my daughter would go crazy over this room.
- it's a little girl's dream.
- may i ask why you're selling? - my husband and i are separated.
Now our daughter's with him.
- so you're single.
- i am.
You've been married long? - uh, yes, about six months.
Ah, that came out wrong.
- [laughs.]
I understand.
believe me.
- zoey, there's a couple here who have a question About the hot tub.
- okay, i'll be right down.
To be continued.
- sure.
A little girl's dream Follow the blood.
Follow the blood Zoey crawled into the kitchen, Grabbed the counter to pull herself up, Then reached for the phone, Giving her a perfect opportunity To use the garbage disposal.
- how we doing in here? - uh, there seems to be a problem with the disposal.
- oh.
[sighs.]
Oh, no, no, no.
- it's probably just something jammed in there.
It's an easy fix.
Let me take a look.
- you'd do that? - sure.
Blue nitrile.
The same material found in police protective gloves.
If the glove fits - isn't he a doll? Fixing the disposal.
- huh.
Wasn't broken this morning.
- give it a try.
- all right.
- yay! - if i was your wife, I'd hang on to you.
You're sohandy.
- [chuckles.]
- so it's either The cannery bludgeoning or the bar beating.
- the cannery body was a dump.
Trinity's not a dumper.
He picks a location, takes his victims there.
- so it's the bar.
- hmm.
- fuckin' a.
We've found trinity's Oh! oh, no, oh! - here, here, here.
- fuck me.
- take the file, take the file.
No harm.
[clears throat.]
Um, mind if i? - yeah, sure, why don't you? So, uh, 30 years ago, A father of two was bludgeoned to death Between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 p.
m.
In the bathroom of murphy's tavern.
- which is where i'll be today.
- me too.
- won't that be a problem with ashton? - anton.
And, no, he's coolsort of.
- sort of? - he gets jealous for no reason.
- he's a smart man.
- look, don't make me come up with thought bubbles To put over those silent looks of yours.
Just say what you're thinking.
- all right.
I, uh, i thought i could keep my feelings for you As background noise to this investigation.
But, in working with you, That noise has gotten - loud? - deafening.
But they're my feelings.
- yup.
They're your feelings.
- you're in a committed relationship.

- congratulations? - i need some advice.
- huh, lot of wise people out there.
- i don't trust anyone else with this secret.
- that's too bad.
- maria has awakened mi pasion.
- right.
- when i'm with her, i feel like a man.
Like my heart is blossoming.
- that's a problem? - no.
The problem is she wants to disclose Our relationship to the higher-ups-- Which i--i understand is a formality.
I just hate the thought of them knowing.
- 'cause you're embarrassed.
- because once you define it, it's defined.
It's--it's officially official.
- you're her boyfriend.
- exactly.
- next thing you know, you're moving in, Your life is gone, and it's just kids and neighbors And painted mugs.
- painted mugs? - it's a metaphor.
- for what? - look, if you want out, get out.
Before you have to do something drastic.
- i don't want out.
i don't.
I just want to protect it By keeping it private.
- yeah.
- who knew it would matter so much to me? thanks, socio.
I'll keep you posted on the details.
- great.
I am a stickler for details.
- you still dating that she-bag reporter? Is it that hard for you to get laid? - i'm not-- - after she put Lundy's name in the paper and ruined everything? - i'm not seeing her.
- maybe you should have told her that.
News flash, quinn: you're an idiot.
- yeah, i got your messages.
- but you didn't call me back.
- tell me, is this conversation gonna end up in the paper too? 'cause you have no idea the shitstorm you've gotten me into.
- i'm sorry.
Really, but we can work this out.
- i'm not interested in working it out.
- don't say that.
- come on, it's not like this was a big deal.
- don't you dare tell me there's nothing here.
- you're right, i won't.
But it's way too complicated.
- i don't want to lose you.
- christine.
you never had me.
Find yourself another source.
- on vacation, we buy snow globes, Send postcards to preserve the good times, Remind us where we've been.
Zoey's crime scene had its own memento A glove whose rolled cuff preserved the gunshot residue After she shot herself.
And blood.
Odds are it belongs to the late darius rae.
Ah, zoey, wish you were here.
But since you're not I'll come to you.
I should get to pembroke pines just in time To follow officer kruger home.

[siren wailing.]
This is bad.
What a coincidence.
- out of the vehicle, please.
Hands on the hood, please.
- my wife and i changed our mind about buying a house.
- dexter morgan.
You didn't mention that you were a, uh, spatter analyst, Miami metro.
- didn't seem relevant to house hunting.
- hmm.
Well, the file clerk at my station-- He's a friend.
He told me that sam had pulled my case file, And sam told me he'd loaned it to a colleague.
You can imagine my surprise when i looked up that colleague And saw your face.
- i am writing a paper on blood swipes.
- are you getting off on this? - am i supposed to be? - you're the kind of sicko who likes watching A woman in pain? - not that kind of sicko, no.
- i lost my husband.
I watched my child die in front of me.
Do you have any idea how agonizing that was? - agony would be the normal reaction.
- i will not let that wound be reopened.
Do you understand? Traffic's heavy on brickell.
Might want to avoid it on your way home.
Was, uh, right? I'm letting you off with a warning.
Drive carefully.
- i'm calling it off.
- you can't.
She knows who you are.
- she knows who dexter morgan lab geek is.
- she knows where you live, Where your wife and children will be when they get home In 48 hours.
- if i back off, she backs off.
- still leaves you on the radar of a killer cop Who has no qualms about shooting her family, Much less a lab rat.
- she's stalking me.
Taking her by surprise will be out of the question.
- you're the one who wanted a challenge.
And now you've batted the beehive.
[beeps.]
- dexter, frank lundy here.
Sorry to bother you at home.
I was just trying to reach your sister.
Thought she was maybe with you.
I had an interesting encounter today.
- me too.
- gotta admit, she is impressive.
Makes you wonder why someone like her Ever got married and had kids in the first place.
- someone like her? Someone like her needs to be in control.
- and she thinks she is.
- she won't see me coming.
[phone rings.]
- pembroke pines police department.
- records, please? - transferring.
- records, langsbury speaking.
- uh, yeah, this is miami metro forensics.
I wanted to request copies of a suspect's file.

That's rae with an e.
Drug dealer and alleged killer of zoey kruger's family.
- what is this in regard to? - i--we're--it involves the vacation murders case.
- i'll send the file over.
To whose attention? - just, uh, forensics.
Batting the beehive.
- dexter.
I know everything.
- i'm gonna choose not to misinterpret that.
- when angel said he told you about us, i was Angry, to say the least.
- i really didn't want to know.
- but now you do.
- yeah.
- actually, i'm glad because I could really use a man's opinion on how to handle Our relationship.
Or fling, or whatever it is that he and i are doing naked.
- well, i was just going to lunch.
- that's great.
Beth's cafe sound good? - oh, actually, we should just talk here.
It's more private.
- yeah.
Angel's a great cop.
the best i know.
But he doesn't understand the politics in this building.
And we have to manage how this thing becomes public.
And if it's handled wrong, our jobs could be at risk.
And we can't take that chance.
- inever leave anything to chance.
- thank you.
You're getting good at this relationship stuff.
Mm, marriage agrees with you.
Thank you.
- lundy called last night.
he was trying to reach you.
- [laughs.]
That is just so Fucking great.
- okay.
Looks like the beehive is buzzing.
And here comes the sting.
You're out of your jurisdiction, officer kruger.
Wait for it.
- [stammers.]
what are you doing? - you want info on darius rae? Ask me anything.
- that file was for a case i'm working.
- i asked you nicely to leave me alone.
- you threatened me.
- you think that was a threat? - what, are you gonna murder me too? Like you murdered your family? Your own daughter? - you're sick.
- i know what you did.
I have proof.
- not possible.
- from the garbage disposal, The gloves you wore that night.
There was gun residue on them.
I have a meeting with my superiors tomorrow morning To tell them everything.
- there's no chain of custody.
- still, it'll raise questions.
And if you left this much behind, We'll find something else.
- you're trying to rape me.
- i'm not touching you.
- that's why you came to my house.
And the real estate agent will testify that You were flirting with me.
And then you stalked me here and tried to assault me.
And i had to defend myself.
- except The blowback of my blood into the muzzle of your gun Will show a flat contact shot That's highly unlikely during a struggle.
You could shoot me center mass, But the low directionality will show I was in a defensive position.
You'd have to calculate the exact distance To create a spatter pattern that supports self-defense.
- go ahead.
Tell them.
No one is going to believe you Over me.
So please.
Tell them Everything.
- you won't give me the chance.
I'm counting on it.
[knocks.]
- debra.
You're here.
I called because, trinity, i-- - shut up.
- this time she won't come in a squad car.
This time it won't be about threats and intimidation.
This time, it's for real.
They're all props, The camouflage of a family man.
She'll believe them.
She has no idea who i am, But i know exactly who she is.
Marco Polo.
- she's going to make it look like i walked in On a home robbery, Got myself killed.
She's good at creating the narrative of a crime.
That hand's the first thing i cut off.
[grunts.]
- [cries.]
- surprise.
- [grunts.]
Help! help! Help! Sorry, sorry, i was just buying your tickets.
You're taking a boat out of the country.
Eventually you'll land in the philippines.
You're smart, there's no extradition treaty there.
- i'm not going anywhere.
- i know something about creating a narrative too.
Suitcases packed, your car will be left at the port, And the blue glove is back in your disposal.
You'll flee the country.
You'll--whoosh-- never be caught.
You're that good.
Or that dead.
- you're gonna rape and kill me? - [laughs.]
what is it with you and rape? No one's raping anyone.
Mm, killing on the other hand.
- why are you doing this to me? - why did you do this to them? - it was darius rae.
- no, you wanted out.
You wanted your freedom.
From the constant demands They took it all.
And they wanted more.
- i couldn't breathe.
- you did it to survive.
- you understand.
- i understand, all right.
- look at you.
What kind of father does this? What kind of husband? [groans.]
- not the kind who kills his family.
- you're going to have to choose.
- not what you chose.
- you can't hide what you are.
- oh, i can.
I'm better at it than you.
- you will choose your life over theirs.
- i won't.
I'd rather risk them knowing the truth Than lose them.
Wow.
[sighs.]
I don't want to lose them.
I don't.
That's the difference between us.
- [groans.]
- nice souvenir.
Sure you don't want to stay here? - you didn't raise a loner, dad.
- maybe i should have.
- i'll survive.
- you sure? Better see to that drip, son.
You don't want this place going to hell.
You need it too much.
- my own little vacation spot.
[phone rings.]
Hey, how you guys doing up there? - we're on our way.
We left right after the wedding.
We should be home soon.
- good, i'm glad.
- the house! - don't hurry.
drive safe.
You're home! - yeah, we made it.
The wedding was exhausting.
The kids were a nightmare.
Just wanted to strangle them.
Oh, no.
- yeah, it just slipped out of my hand.
Sorry.
- oh, the kids will be excited to make you a new one.
[sighs.]
[sighs softly.]
I missed you so much.
- i missed you too.
- i'm a fuckwad.
- you're not a fuckwad.
- i knew.
From the second i saw you at the station, I knew how i felt.
It's how i've always felt.
I just wouldn't admit it.
'cause i'm a fuckwad.
- you're human.
- and now i've cheated on a guy Who doesn't deserve to be treated that way.
I should have broken up with him first.
But i'm a fuckwad.
- no.
don't.
You're not.
You're beautiful.
And you were confused.
And now you're not.
So We'll set this right, together.
All right? - don't go disappearing on me again.
- not a-- [gunshot.]
[two gunshots.]
- stay with me.
