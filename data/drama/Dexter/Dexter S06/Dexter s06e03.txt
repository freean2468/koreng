Previously on Dexter Holy frankenfuck! Snakes! This is no amateur.
What the fuck? Debra Morgan, will you Are you insane? What is that holy piece of shit doing here? - Brother Sam? - One big, bad ex-con turned minister.
Runs an auto body shop using former inmates.
That can't be a man of the cloth.
That's a killer.
It's why I'm making you Homicide's new lieutenant.
Fuckballs, you're serious.
I couldn't be happier.
It's about time a real cop had that job.
How come if Matthews hates you, I'm always the one paying the price? I can't tell if I'm seeing a man who's changed for the better or just a better cover.
So that darkness inside is gone? It's still there, but I'm fighting its ass every day.
Please get off the property.
Not without our boy Nick.
You deaf, pendejo? I can't marry you.
I'm sorry.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Lieutenant Debra Morgan.
- Hey, you all right? - No.
Really? Yeah, I think I heard something snap.
How about we wind up the Kentucky Derby and we focus on breakfast? - Yummy, OK? - No.
- No, Harrison.
- Mine.
Horsey mine.
When you're Harrison's age, everything's important.
Everything has meaning, even a piece of moulded plastic.
How about we can play with the horse afterwards, OK? It took me 20 minutes to decide what to wear.
- Really? - What? Don't I look OK? Yeah.
You put on a jacket over your regular clothes.
Yeah, well, I don't want to overdo it.
I still want to look like me.
Just Lieutenant-me.
Smart.
It's dispatch.
Probable homicide, 930 Euclid.
It's about 10 minutes away.
I'll meet you there.
You're going to the crime scene? It's just LaGuerta never went into the field unless she knew the case was gonna be high-profile.
Yeah, well, I'm not LaGuerta, am I? It's totally your call.
Shit.
You're probably right.
It's my first day.
I should probably be at the station working the snakes killing in my fucking office.
OK, buddy.
Be good to Jamie today.
And no Fruit Roll-Ups.
They make you fart.
Don't we know.
Good luck today.
You're gonna be great.
Thanks.
Why are you doing this to me? Please, just let me go.
You're not going anywhere until you've repented for your sins.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.
Not to me.
To God.
Beg forgiveness, Nathan.
If you're sincere, all of this will end.
If not, it will get much worse.
But I am sincere.
Please don't Wait.
A full 800 RPMs over the red line.
In high school, that was my dream car.
Didn't Smokey drive one of those? Or was it the Bandit? Burt Reynolds.
Yo, guys! Body's down here.
Any idea who she is? From her tight mini and a 24-pack of Trojans in her pocket, I'd say she's a working girl.
No driver's licence? Haven't found a purse or an ID.
We need to roll her over.
Easy.
Guess she lost her gym membership.
- Where the hell's Quinn? - He's on his way.
Multiple blunt force trauma or manual strangulation.
Take your pick.
Are you crazy? OK, OK.
I'm late.
I'm sorry.
Not that.
The girl.
What are you doing, man? What about Deb? Deb and I broke up.
You broke up? Yeah, three days ago.
We're over.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.
What happened? Lieutenant Morgan happened.
She ditched you because she got promoted? - That doesn't sound like Deb.
- Yeah? Cos this is the same Deb that stole your job.
She didn't steal my job.
It was never mine to start with.
That's always been your problem.
You're too nice.
You let these fucking people walk all over you.
That's bullshit.
Keep telling yourself that, Mrs LaGuerta.
You're lucky we got work to do.
- What's so interesting? - Tooth is chipped.
No surprise there.
She really got worked over.
It's probably from the beating.
Or someone tried to rip it out.
You'll be leading your first briefing soon, so make sure you scan all the field reports.
It's next on my list.
I just wanna finish going through these résumés.
Résumés? I need to pick a new detective to take my place.
I can't afford to be down a man right now.
Well, I can help you with that.
Let's see here Sam Harmon from Narcotics.
He's a real up-and-comer, and the fact that his father's a district judge could come in handy.
Yeah, I know Sam.
He's a solid cop.
Great.
Happy to help.
There are a lot of other names on this list.
You know, there's this guy from Chicago Forget him.
With everything on your plate right now, the last thing you want to worry about is a transfer situation, trust me.
Harmon's your guy.
Do you want me to start the paperwork? No.
I've got it.
Go ahead.
Morgan.
Don't let her shove something down your throat, not unless you're ready for seconds or thirds.
Take it from Mrs LaGuerta.
Got it.
Thanks.
Deb, one of the most important things about this job is knowing how to marshal your resources.
Take the help when it's offered.
Remember, we're in this together.
I remember when I found that under your bed.
I would have rather it had been a stack of Playboys.
Most kids in the eighth grade were obsessed with their favourite baseball players.
You tracked serial killers.
Only certain ones.
The Tooth Fairy was smart and arrogant.
They never caught him, even when he left a body on a deputy sheriff's lawn.
Fifteen women, prostitutes, all dumped on the roadside, all missing their lateral incisors.
You really think there's a connection to the victim from this morning? Her lateral incisor was cracked like someone tried to rip it out with pliers.
There was damage to her gums.
Probably a result of the beating, like Masuka said.
Maybe someone was trying to relive old times? The Tooth Fairy killings were in the '80s, Dexter.
He'd be 70 years old at least.
What would he be doing in Miami? Why do most 70-year-olds come to Miami? They say old age is like a second childhood.
There are primary colours, tricycles and ball-chasing.
I barely made it through my first childhood.
I guess no one makes it through the second.
This place is one block from where the victim was found.
A short walk for a retiree on a mission.
- Can I help you? - I hope so.
I'm thinking about moving my dad down here.
He's 81, but still sprightly.
Bless his heart.
Coral Island's a great facility.
I'm happy to answer any questions you have.
Do you have any other residents here from Oregon? My dad's kind of shy and it'd be nice to have people around with something in common, besides hearing loss.
Let's see.
We have three residents from Oregon.
Fine people.
I'm sure your dad will get along with them famously.
That's good to hear.
Here are some brochures with everything you need to know about Coral Island.
There's some forms to fill out in case you're interested in having your dad join us.
Thanks.
I hate to trouble you, but that coffee really looks good.
I was gonna get some earlier.
I feel a caffeine headache coming on.
I know what that's like.
I'll fetch you a mug.
- Be right back.
- I appreciate it.
One woman, another in a wheelchair.
That leaves Moved here from Grants Pass, Oregon, five years ago.
How are you spending your second childhood? What's that? You've been doing such a good job, I put together a little surprise for your viewing pleasure.
Is this what I think it is? Evidence from the Ice Truck Killer investigation.
You said in class how you were really into this case.
Are you kidding? I was obsessed with this case.
I have followed it night and day.
This is really sweet.
This is the Ice Truck Killer's hospital ID.
And the holy of holies.
You know, when the details of this case were made public, I painted my nails like this for a whole week.
Is that just wrong? Is it wrong that it makes me hot? What do they do with all this stuff? It just sits here in evidence, forever.
That's a shame.
I mean, this is a piece of history.
It's time for the briefing.
There you are.
I've sat through God knows how many briefings.
Why am I so fucking nervous? Because everyone will be looking to see if you know what you're doing.
Do me a favour.
When you get back to your desk, look up the word "rhetorical".
You'll be fine, Deb.
OK, everyone, we've got a lot to cover, so let's get started.
First up is the homicide on Euclid.
Where are we on identifying the victim? Her fingerprints gave us a name: Rosalia Davolos.
Several priors for solicitation.
We talked to the local merchants.
Seems that strip was practically her office.
Did we run her cell phone? It turned up a long list of numbers, mostly johns.
We're working through the names now.
What about a tox screen? Trace amounts of cocaine in her system and doughnuts.
Let's check the area for known pushers.
Maybe she got caught up in a bad deal or she got behind on a payment.
I'm hoping five or six people will volunteer They'll never tie this to a quarter-century-old serial killer case from Oregon.
Not sure I have either, but I can dream.
That takes us to the snakes killing.
It's looking like this wasn't a drug cartel hit after all.
As much as I hate to admit it, maybe Brother Sam was right about our victim.
Maybe he'd cleaned up his act.
That doesn't mean there wasn't someone out there looking to settle an old score.
What if we made some of the details of the case public, like the snakes? Might scare up a lead.
No.
That may compromise the case when it goes to court.
If we don't catch anyone, this will never go to court.
I think Detective Quinn has a point.
We let word out about the snakes, the press will eat it up.
Who knows? Maybe something will shake loose.
- What about the trial? - Quinn's right.
There'll never be a trial unless we get someone into custody.
I think it's worth a try.
Angel, get started on the statement.
Have it on my desk by this afternoon.
I don't think you really believe what you are saying, Nathan! You need to believe what you are saying! I do.
I swear.
I don't know what it is you want from me.
I want to hear you tell God that you are sorry.
OK.
OK.
Please, please, God I'm sorry for everything I've ever done.
Just forgive me.
Forgive me.
No, no.
Wait.
Wait.
Where are you going? Let me go! Let me go! He's telling you what you want to hear.
He thinks we're gonna release him.
How much longer do we have to make him suffer? You really have a good heart, Travis.
That's why I picked you.
But there's much more at stake here than one man's suffering.
Don't we have to be strong? He has to be pure or we can't proceed.
Yes.
He's coming around.
It just takes time.
Good morning, Walter.
Keep saying that and one day you might be right.
Sam's group is about to tee off.
You can join them.
I'm short a partner.
Dan.
Walter Kenney.
I'm a little rusty, but I'll try not to slow you down.
Just get a cart, will you? Worst mistake I ever made was moving down to this piss-butt corner of the country.
How bad can it be? It's the Sunshine State.
Only sunshine around here is what they blow up your ass.
The rest is mosquitoes, humidity and people that don't speak English.
So what's a young guy like you doing around Coral Island? Or do you get off hanging out with corpses? I'm checking it out for my dad.
You want to help your dad? Take him to the end of the pier and push him off.
You'll be doing him a favour.
If I was any more in the rough, I'd need a fucking machete.
This is like being trapped in a toxic cloud that cheats.
Son of a bitch! You OK? I always scream in pain when I take a swing.
Don't just stand there.
I need to sit down.
All right.
I ruptured my back two years ago.
It hasn't been the same since.
OK, just take it easy.
Jesus fucking Christ! Listen, I'm done here.
Just drop me off at the club bar.
I need something to kill the pain.
You got it.
So what'd you used to do up in Oregon? I was a pipe fitter for 25 years.
Shit job, but I managed to work up a pension.
All I want to do now is play golf.
Maybe you should find something else to pass the time.
I tell you, it's hell not being able to do what you love.
Is he talking about golf or his failure to rip out Rosalia Davolos' tooth? Walter Kenney may be the world's oldest asshole, but that doesn't make him a killer.
On the other hand, maybe I gave up too soon.
He wears a dental implant for the lateral incisor.
The same one the Tooth Fairy pulled from his victims.
Excuse me.
Hello? This is Sam from Good Shepherd Auto.
I was just calling to let you know your car's ready.
Great.
When can I pick it up? If you get here before 6:00, you won't have to fight the dog off this time.
- I'm on my way.
- OK.
This is on me.
I got to go pick up my car.
You know, I've got a shitload of errands to run tomorrow and with my back the way it is, I'm gonna have a real hard time on the bus.
You wouldn't want to give me a ride, would you? Perfect, now I won't have to make an excuse to run into you again.
I'm in 72.
Pick me up at 9:00.
Actually, I'd rather have my teeth pulled.
Happy to do it.
People don't put no oil in it and then wonder why they Hey! Hey, man, yeah.
She's right down here.
I'll be right back, Nick.
God bless him.
Nick has been busting his ass, man.
He's off the drugs.
Cut his ties with the gang, man.
I really think he wants to change.
You must be relieved.
I'm proud of him is what I am, man.
It's not easy turning your life around, man.
It could go south at any minute, but I'll take the blessings as they come.
This looks like the day I bought it.
You do good work.
It's all these repair jobs that pay for that good work.
Listen.
You got any plans this Sunday? Like service? What would I be getting serviced? Like a church service.
No.
Not much of a churchgoer.
Yeah, I figured that.
Well, we having something like a company get-together, like a beach party.
It'd be great if you could come.
This Sunday's tough.
I don't have a sitter for Harrison.
That's your boy? Yep.
He's two.
Yeah? Bring him along.
It's a kid-friendly environment.
He'll love it.
Play some ball, put the grill on, have a little beach barbecue baptism.
- Baptism? - Yeah.
Nick.
He's taking the big leap, praise God.
He's taking the Holy Spirit on right there in the waters of the Biscayne Bay.
Sounds like you're trying to get me to go to church.
So what? What? You afraid you gonna catch something? I'm just not sure I fit in.
Sure you do.
Listen.
I just think it'd be great for you to take a stand with someone whose life that you helped turn around.
And if you do happen to find God, a lot worse ways you could spend your day off.
Only one mention of Walter Kenney in the criminal database, and he's identified as a victim.
Walter Kenney's mother, charged with felony child abuse against her son.
I have to vent, or my head's gonna explode.
- What's wrong? - Everything.
I'm my ex-boyfriend's boss.
I don't know how to act.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know who to hire.
I have a stack of paperwork on my desk that's taller than I am.
Take a breath, sit down.
I think I really fucked up taking this promotion.
I was a fucking great detective who loved her fucking job.
I traded it all in for politics and paperwork and LaGuerta up my ass.
Deb, you're too smart to think that this was gonna be easy.
Well, I didn't expect this.
I didn't expect people sitting around waiting for me to fall on my face.
No one wants you to fail.
OK, LaGuerta probably wouldn't lose any sleep if you stumbled a bit.
She'd pop a bottle of champagne.
But guess what.
You're new at the job.
You're gonna stumble.
You think LaGuerta never messed up? Shit, yeah.
Cut yourself some slack.
You've been Lieutenant one day.
If a couple months go by, you still hate it, you can demote yourself, but until then, just go with your gut.
And when you screw up, just don't take me down with you.
I need the paycheck.
OK.
My panic needle's swinging out of the red.
Good.
How are you with the Quinn of it? I miss being with him.
Really? Quinn's a good guy.
We had fun together.
It was easy.
No expectations.
That's one decision I know I made right.
Quinn and I were never meant to get serious.
I have to go.
I have to put people on the snakes killing.
Thank you for talking me off the ledge.
You're the best.
Is it a good time for me to ask for a raise? - Terrible.
- I'm serious.
Fuck off and die.
Maybe she shouldn't have taken the promotion.
She might not be cut out for it.
I think there's very little Deb's not cut out for.
Kenney's mother was taken into custody for repeatedly hitting her son in the face in public.
I'm not seeing the connection.
Maybe that's how he lost his tooth.
So Walter Kenney has mother issues.
Sounds familiar.
Doesn't mean that he is the Tooth Fairy.
But it's another reason for me to spend my day off with Mr Sunshine.
You said 9:00.
I just need a couple of seconds.
TV, Barcalounger and a view of the parking lot.
This wasn't on the Coral Island brochure.
My son.
Gave him everything in life, and now I can't get him on the phone.
You have kids? You're lucky.
Ungrateful little pricks.
They suck the life out of you, and then they vanish.
Where are my fucking house keys? He's completely alone.
Alienated everyone around him.
Here they are.
I'm losing my fucking mind.
Abrams in 23.
Dumb as a bag of dog shit.
Looks like a space just opened up for your dad.
Shit.
Here's my prescription.
Just pick it up for me, will you? Sure.
Hey, hey, hey! And a six-pack of beer from the liquor store and the latest Teen Ass, Nipple Parade and Spanked.
Teen Ass, Nipple Parade and Spanked.
Can this really be the man who inspired me to keep a scrapbook? Can I get Teen Ass, Nipple Parade, and Spanked? Some needs just don't go away.
Even if the equipment is on life support.
Does that hold true for killing? Just one last stop, and then I'm out of your hair.
I'll take the bus home from here.
What about your back? Got my remedy.
See you.
What wrong turns do you take to lead to this at the end of your life? An 8 by 12 storage shed, a six-pack of beer and a stack of porno mags.
I need those rundowns on the interviews you did with the victim's johns.
Yeah, I'm still working on them.
Anything I should know? They're all sketchy characters, but their alibis check out.
Final forensics report on the snakes killing.
Nothing new, but if you notice the grammar's improved, it's because Ryan typed it up.
So, Ryan, right? You've been here a week now.
How you liking it? - It's heaven.
- Yeah? - Even with Vince around? - Good one.
I love homicide.
I've always been fascinated by people who do bad things.
Maybe that's cos you got a little bad in you.
You think? I think you got a lot of bad in you.
You may be right.
Yeah.
But you'll never know.
Can I talk to you for a second? We're still interviewing Rosalia's johns.
- So far, nothing.
- Not about the case.
I want to know how you're doing with the whole situation.
Right.
I'm good.
Matter of fact, I just got done packing up your stuff.
You didn't have to do that.
You know, I figured you're busy with your new job and all.
You know, might not have time.
Kind of wanted it out of the house.
So if you want to pick it up, it's in the garage right next to the big bag of fertiliser.
Quinn, I know you're pissed.
You're doing a great job of letting me know that.
But this wasn't easy on me either.
I'm sure.
You know, from what I hear, that promotion just came out of the blue.
You think that my becoming Lieutenant had anything to do with what happened between us? No, I'm sure it was just a big fucking coincidence.
Quinn, that is so fucking unfair.
There seems to be a lot of that going around.
I got my share.
Maybe you're getting yours.
Don't hurt me.
You have to make a choice, Nathan.
Are you going to be saved? - It's up to you.
- Yes, please! Please.
Dear God, cleanse me of all my sins.
Forgive me for all the evil that I've done.
Forgive me, please.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
He's ready.
Two hours in that storage facility.
I'm guessing he wasn't organising his Penthouse collection.
It's like my box of slides.
Dried blood on the roots.
These are from all of his victims.
He's the Tooth Fairy.
The man who terrorised the Pacific Northwest for 20 years.
All he has left is a box of teeth.
Is this what happens to serial killers at the end of their lives? Everything's ready.
Kenney's apartment will make the perfect kill room.
No one ever visits him and the maid won't show up until the morning.
Tonight, Walter Kenney will have his final tee-off.
- Hello? - It's Walter.
I'm really fucked! What is it? I got off at the wrong stop, and now I don't know where the hell I am.
I've been riding around for hours.
Fucking hell! OK, OK.
Just calm down.
I'll swing by and pick you up.
What's the street name and number of the bus stop? Got it.
Just stay where you are.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
He made it easy for me to vet him.
Now he's making it easy for me to kill him.
Kenney's a monster, but at least he's considerate.
I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me.
Sometimes I get so confused.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
I'm just glad I was in the neighbourhood.
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't answered.
You're a good kid.
As if I wasn't starting to feel enough pity for him, now he's throwing gratitude at me? Keep your eye on the road or I'll blow your head out the window.
Drive until I tell you to turn.
How did you get on to me? I don't know what you're talking about.
You're Miami Metro, Dexter.
I checked your car registration when you were filling my prescription, and then I "goggled" your name.
Yeah, that's right, dickwad.
Maybe I haven't taken a decent shit in 10 years, but I'm not fucking stupid.
Turn right at the next light.
Where are we going? To settle our business.
You're gonna tell me how you figured out who I am.
And then you're gonna kill me? You haven't left me much choice, have you? Left into the next parking lot.
OK.
And just for kicks, I might rip out all your teeth before I shoot you.
What the fuck are you Those are ready for cataloguing.
Hey, after work tonight, you want to grab some pho? Grab some what? It's Vietnamese food.
It's basically a large bowl of noodles.
And broth.
So you're asking me out? As in a date? You don't have to call it that if you don't want to.
I want to.
So that's a yes? Yeah.
Wow.
What? It's just that I ran the conversation through my mind a bunch of times.
It always ended in rejection and bodily harm.
You should be more confident.
You know, in the right light, you're actually kind of cute.
I'm about to interview my top pick for the detective slot.
I thought you might want to sit in.
No point.
Sam Harmon and I go way back.
- Harmon's not my top choice.
- He's not? It's Mike Anderson, the transfer from Chicago.
He's got 10 years on homicide, a ridiculous solve rate, recommendations coming out of his ass.
We'd be lucky to have him.
I really put a lot of thought into this.
If that's true, then I'm seriously worried about your judgement, because this is a huge mistake.
I don't think it is.
Look, I know I'm new at this job.
And it's not that I don't value your advice, but sometimes I have to trust my gut, and right now my gut is telling me Mike Anderson.
It's your decision, Lieutenant.
You can do whatever the hell you want.
But understand this: You're on your own.
If this doesn't work out, don't look to me to have your back.
Mike Anderson.
I'm here to see the lieutenant.
That's me.
It's great to meet you.
Debra Morgan.
- What's funny? - You, the lieutenant.
- That a problem? - Listen.
I just got off a three-hour flight and I'm really tired, which means I'm not in the mood for any cute department razzing.
So will you take me to your boss, please? Maybe score me some coffee on the way, no cream.
You listen.
Right now, you're my top choice for this job, but that can change real fucking fast.
I put my ass on the line even considering you, so stow the attitude or the only job you're gonna find in this city is guarding a landfill as a rent-a-cop.
Look, I apologise.
I didn't mean any disrespect.
It's just the other lieutenants I've served under had Dicks? Been around the block.
Trust me.
This is just as weird for me as it is for you.
Moving on.
Let's talk.
You know, I just got my car out of the shop.
What the hell is this? This is the end, Walter.
You pulled your last tooth.
How did I get here? Service entrance.
I think I tweaked my back.
Fuck me.
You could have spent your final days relaxing, enjoying life, but then there was Rosalia Davolos.
She's the first one in 10 years.
Wasn't she? Why now? I got tired of staring at a box of teeth.
Took me 10 minutes to kill the whore.
Lost another 20 trying to pull the goddamn tooth.
You know, when I was in high school, it seemed you were all the country was talking about.
The Tooth Fairy.
Too clever for the police.
They couldn't catch you.
Like Burt Reynolds with his Trans Am.
I still can't believe you are the same man that dumped a body at a deputy sheriff's house.
Total fucking accident.
I downed a few too many and didn't feel like driving out to the highway to get rid of the bitch.
That's disappointing.
Well, I'm very fucking sorry to let you down.
Does that mean you don't want my autograph? No.
Just this.
I took teeth.
You take blood.
You're the same kind of sick fuck, aren't you? At least I'm never gonna end up like you.
Yeah? When you can't do this any more, what do you have then? More.
You're kidding yourself, asshole.
All I ever cared about was killing, and I can't even do that right any more.
That's what you've got to look forward to.
This is your future, and it includes adult fucking diapers! You are not my future.
I will not spend my final days getting drunk and staring at a box of trophies.
Keep telling yourself that.
Make sure they know who I am.
I wish I could see the look on my son's face when he finds out.
He won't be able to ignore that! I'd never want my son to know who I was.
You said you didn't have a kid.
I also said my name was Dan.
What are you doing? You're not gonna die as the Tooth Fairy.
You're gonna die as a sad old man of a heart attack.
No! The latest resident to check out of the Coral Island Retirement Village.
Walter Kenney's son will never know his father was a monster.
Or at least not a killer.
We all want life to have some kind of meaning.
Seems like the older we get, the harder we look for it and the harder it is to find.
And some of us just look in the wrong place.
But if our lives don't have meaning Horsey, Daddy.
what can we leave behind for those we care about? There you go, buddy.
Walter Kenney wanted to pass on the ugliness that his life had become.
What will I pass on? I don't know which slide goes where, who's who.
There's no order any more.
