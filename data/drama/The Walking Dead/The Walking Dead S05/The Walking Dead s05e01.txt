Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead Terminus Tomorrow we go to the end of the line.
Then, Washington.
I love you, Lizzie.
You don't need to stay.
We can't stay.
Just in case Welcome to Terminus! Go to the train car.
Now! Rick! They're gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out they're screwing with the wrong people.
( woman screaming ) ( whimpering ) Alex: We should never have put up the signs.
What the hell did we think was gonna happen? We brought them here.
We were trying to do something good.
- ( laughs ) - We were being human beings.
What are we now, Gareth? ( woman screaming ) ( radio chatter ) Abraham: They seemed nice enough, but I was ready to go.
We just got here, but, damn, it was time to go.
When I told them about DC, a wink and a nod from the head asshole in charge, they pulled their guns and it was right back to our regularly scheduled shitstorm.
Sasha: Before they put you in here, you didn't see Tyreese? - Michonne: No.
- Sasha: Good.
Daryl: Black car with a white cross painted on it.
I tried to follow it.
I tried.
Maggie: But she's alive? Daryl: She's alive.
( radio chatter continues ) ( men chatting ) Man: What are you doing? Everybody shut up.
Shut up! All right, got four of them pricks coming our way.
Y'all know what to do.
Go for their eyes first.
Then their throats.
Man: Put your backs to the walls on either side of the car now.
( footsteps on roof ) Move! ( doors opening ) ( gas mask hissing ) ( grunts ) ( saw buzzing ) Okay, hold up.
All right.
( whimpering ) ( muffled screaming ) - ( knife slices ) - ( blood pouring ) Hey, guys.
What were your shot counts? - 38.
- ( thuds ) Gareth: Hey! Your shot count? Crap, man, I'm sorry.
It was my first roundup.
After you're done here, go back to your point and count the shells.
Kaylee won't be gathering them until tomorrow.
( muffled ) Hey.
Hey, let me talk to you.
Four from A, four from D? Man: Yeah.
Hey, let me talk to you for a minute.
Let me talk to you for a minute.
- Let me talk to you for a minute.
- What? Don't do this.
We can fix this.
- No, you can't.
- You don't have to do this.
We told you there's a way out of all this.
You just have to take a chance.
We have a man who knows how to stop it.
He has a cure.
We just have to get him to Washington.
You don't have to do this, man.
We can put the world back to how it was.
Can't go back, Bob.
We can! You don't have to do this! We saw you go into the woods with a bag and come out without it.
Had to pull my spotters back before we could go look for it.
What was in it? You hid it, right? In case things went bad? Smart.
Still, we'll find it.
But it's too dangerous to go out there right now.
What was in it? I'm curious.
And it was a big bag.
You really gonna let me do this? Well, let me take you out there.
I'll show you.
Not gonna happen.
This might.
Rick: There's guns in it.
AK-47.
.
44 Magnum.
Automatic weapons.
Nightscope.
There's a compound bow and a machete with a red handle.
That's what I'm gonna use to kill you.
( chuckles ) ( sighs ) Thanks.
You have two hours to get them on the driers.
I'm gonna go back to public face.
Now's the time we can get messy, but we need to dial it all in by sundown.
- Got it.
- Yes, sir.
( gunshots ) Hey, Chuck? ( gunshot ) ( rumbling ) ( theme music playing ) We're close.
I'm gonna get you both there.
Make sure you're safe.
( baby coos ) But I'm not gonna stay.
( snarling ) ( crying ) I can't.
Not yet.
You're going to have to be able to.
( snarling ) ( whispers ) More.
( snarling ) ( gunshots ) ( gunshots continue ) That gunfire, it could have been from Terminus.
Someone was attacking them.
Or they were attacking someone.
Do we even want to find out? Yeah.
There's another track due east.
It'll get us there.
We'll be real careful.
We're gonna get answers.
Woman on radio: 10-minute count.
You screw up, you're on your own, Martin.
You don't have to tell me.
I wipe my own ass.
Alex didn't get it.
See, I knew the chick with the sword was bad news.
Bitch looked like a weapon with a weapon.
He was always a sloppy-ass mother.
Yeah, I told Albert I want the kid's hat after they bleed him out.
Keep your finger off the button and drop it.
They're only doing eight before public face.
Listen, y'all don't have to do this.
Whatever you want, we got a place where everyone's welcome.
- Shut up, man.
- Okay.
We're friends of the chick with the sword and the kid in the hat.
They attacked us.
We're just holding them.
I don't believe you.
Who else do you have? Do you know their names? We just have the boy and the samurai, that's it.
We were just protecting ourselves.
I don't believe you.
There's a bunch of us out there in six different directions.
There was a lot of gunfire back home.
We need to set off our charges all at the same time to confuse the dead ones away.
That's good for you, too.
No, it isn't.
There's a herd heading toward Terminus right now.
We don't want to confuse them away.
We're gonna need their help.
It's a compound.
They'll see you coming.
If you even make it that far with all the cold bodies heading over.
Carol.
How are you gonna do this? I'm gonna kill people.
She got a name? Hey, she got a name? Judith.
She your daughter or something? She's a friend.
Huh.
( sighs ) I don't have any friends.
I mean, I know people.
They're just assholes I stay alive with.
The other one your friend? The woman? I used to have them.
Used to watch football on Sundays.
Went to church.
( laughs ) I know I did.
But I can't picture it anymore.
It's funny how you don't even notice the time go by.
Horrible shit just stacks up day after day.
You get used to it.
I haven't gotten used to it.
Of course you haven't.
You're the kind of guy who saves babies.
It's kind of like saving an anchor when you're stuck without a boat in the middle of the ocean.
Been behind some kind of walls, right? You're still around, but you haven't had to get your hands dirty.
I can tell.
See, you're a good guy.
You have no idea about the things I've done.
You're a good guy.
That's why you're gonna die today.
It's why the baby is going to die.
Or you can get in that car, get out of here, keep on being lucky.
You think you're gonna kill me? Why haven't you killed me? How does having me alive help you? Why the hell are you even talking to me? Take her, take the car, and go.
I don't want to do this today.
( walks snarling ) Man: Put your backs to the wall on either side of the car now.
( snarling ) ( shouting ) ( gunshots ) - Is that Terminus? - Yeah.
Probably.
Maybe you're gonna win this.
Maybe your friend-- I mean, maybe that woman just got capped.
Maybe I'm gonna be the one who gets capped when she comes back.
Nobody's got to die today.
( scoffs ) Man, if you believe that then it's definitely gonna be you and the kid.
Even if that place is burning to the ground.
( gunfire ) Man on radio: Hey, what the hell was that? Do you copy? - You stay here.
- Gareth, these guys aren't going anywhere.
Stay here until I know what's happening.
Man: So we just sit here? Got a job to do.
( grunting ) ( gunfire continues ) ( gasping ) ( snarling ) Oh, Jesus.
( snarling ) ( screaming ) - You there, Gareth? - He's busy.
You smell the smoke? You hear the shots? He could be dead.
The hell we doing here? The whole place could be going up.
You went on one roundup and you blew protocol.
We don't deal with security.
That ain't our job.
This is.
Hey, look at me.
What? No, no, no, no, no! Glenn: Rick! What the hell is going on? - Michonne: Someone hit them.
- Maybe our people got free.
Excuse me.
What the hell are you doing? I might be able to use this shell to compromise the door.
From the sound of things, there may not be anybody left to open it.
Eugene, I'm sorry, but shut up.
- Okay.
- Hey.
My dad's gonna be back.
- They all are.
- They are.
And we need to get ready to fight our way out with them when they do.
( snarling ) ( woman screaming ) ( gunfire continues ) ( screaming ) ( gunshot ) ( snarling ) If they got problems, we got a chance.
It sounded like a bomb.
Sounds like a damn war.
Right there.
What the hell are these people? They ain't people.
Don't.
Let him turn.
Cross any of these people, you kill them.
Don't hesitate.
They won't.
( gunfire continues ) ( man shouting ) Rick: If we run, we can get by them.
They're distracted.
We got to let those people out.
That's still who we are.
It's got to be.
Man: Help me! ( shouting continues ) Come on, come on, come on.
We're the same! We're them! Back off! ( laughs ) We're the same.
( snarling ) Come on.
( grunting ) ( water dripping ) ( gunfire ) ( gunfire continues ) - We got to double back.
- Rick: A is that way.
We go back, we don't know where we are.
We don't really have a choice, do we? ( gunshots ) - Wait here.
- Rick.
Rick! ( snarling ) Man: Reloading! ( groans ) ( walkers snarling ) ( screaming ) ( screaming ) We're going to have to double back.
( gunfire continues ) Drop your weapons and turn around.
I want to see your face.
( walkers snarling ) Now! ( grunting ) Ah! ( panting ) The signs they were real.
It was a sanctuary.
People came and took this place.
- Just tell me where-- - And they raped and they killed and they laughed over weeks.
But we got out and we fought and we got it back.
And we heard the message.
You're the butcher or you're the cattle.
The men they pulled from that train car, where are they? - ( screams ) - Where are they? ( groaning ) Now point it at my head.
( laughs ) You could have been one of us.
You could have listened to what the world is telling you.
You lead people here and you take what they have and you kill them? Is that what this place is? No, not at first.
It's what it had to be.
And we're still here.
You're not here.
Neither am I.
( snarling ) No! No! No! Oh! No, God! No! No! ( walkers snarling ) Back off! ( crying ) Back off! Put your weapons on the ground.
Kick them over right now.
Right now! Tyreese: Please.
Please, don't.
Don't hurt her.
( crying ) Go outside.
Go outside! Just one twist, man.
- Don't! - Don't make me! ( crying ) Go outside.
All right.
- ( snarling ) - ( screaming ) Cynthia, do you copy? ( static hissing ) Cynthia, do you copy? - ( pounding ) - ( Tyreese grunting ) ( pounding stops ) ( fussing ) ( grunts ) Yeah.
That's how it works.
I won't.
( grunts ) - ( grunts ) - I won't! I won't! - ( blows landing ) - Tyreese: I won't! I won't! ( gunfire continues ) What's the cure, Eugene? It's classified.
We don't know what's gonna happen.
Abraham: You leave him be.
- We need to keep working.
- Yeah, but it's time to hear it.
'Cause we don't know what's coming next.
What's next is we get out of this.
Even if I told you all, even if I provided step-by-step instructions complete with illustrations and a well-composed FAQ and I went red-ring, the cure would still die with me.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
The best-case scenario, we step out into a hellstorm of bullets, fire, and walkers.
I'm not fleet of foot.
I sure as hell can't take a dead one down with sharp buttons and hella confidence.
Yeah, but we can and we will.
You don't owe us anything.
Not yet.
But we just want to hear it.
You don't have to.
I was part of a 10-person team at the Human Genome Project to weaponize diseases to fight weaponized diseases.
Pathogenic microorganisms with pathogenic microorganisms.
Fire with fire.
Interdepartmental drinks were had, relationships made, information shared.
I am keenly aware of all the details behind fail-safe delivery systems to kill every living person on this planet.
I believe with a little tweaking on the terminals in DC, we can flip the script.
Take out every last dead one of them.
Fire with fire.
All things being equal, it does sound pretty badass.
So let's get back to work.
( banging ) Come on! Fight to the fence! Man: Do not leave his side! - Go, go, go! - Carl! Come on.
Let's go! Up and over.
Let's go! Move! Man: Let's go! Move! Woman: Come on! Right here.
Abraham: The hell are we still around here for? Rick: Guns, some supplies.
Go along the fences.
Use the rifles.
Take out the rest of 'em.
What? They don't get to live.
Rick, we got out.
It's over.
It's not over till they're all dead.
The hell it isn't.
That place is on fire.
Full of walkers.
Abraham: I'm not dicking around with this crap.
We just made it out.
The fences are down.
They'll run or die.
( laughs ) Did you do that? ( laughs ) You have to come with me.
( crying ) Judith.
You're okay.
( sobbing ) ( no audible dialogue ) ( Judith crying ) What happened? There were a bunch of walkers out here and he got his hands around Judith's neck.
No, he's dead.
I-- I had to.
So I did.
I could.
I don't know if the fire is still burning.
It is.
Yeah.
We need to go.
Daryl: Yeah, but where? Somewhere far away from there.
We'll talk to him.
Not just yet.
( whimpering ) Alex: Mom! Mom, come on.
( gasping ) Woman: No! Man: That one.
No, no, please.
Not again.
( sobbing ) No! No! It's okay.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- ( shrieks ) No, it's not.
( chuckles ) ( screams ) ( door shuts ) We're gonna take it back.
How? We will.
You're either the butcher or the cattle.
Oh.
