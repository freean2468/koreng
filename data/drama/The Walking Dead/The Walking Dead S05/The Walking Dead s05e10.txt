Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead No! Entire families torn apart.
Begging me for mercy.
Maybe it's because we're still the same.
I don't think I can be Not anymore.
We made it.
It's gone.
He did the math and realized that Washington is the place where there'd be a chance.
We should go.
We should go to Washington.
You gotta hold on, man.
Hold on! (footsteps) (walker snarling) (sniffles) (crying) Oh, shit.
It's been a day and a half.
They didn't find any either.
- Sasha: How do you know? - I know.
How much longer we got? I wasn't talking about that.
(theme music playing) (engine sputtering) Abraham: We're out, just like the other one.
Rick: So we walk.
We're not at our strongest.
We'll get 'em when it's best.
High ground, something like that.
They're not going anywhere.
It's been three weeks since Atlanta.
I know you lost something back there.
(Judith fussing) She's hungry.
She's okay.
She's going to be okay.
We need to find water, food.
We'll hit something in the road.
It's gonna rain sooner or later.
I'm gonna head out.
See what I can find.
Hey, don't be too long.
I'll go with you.
I got it.
You gonna stop me? Found this when we were looking for water.
What is it? I think it used to play music.
It's broken.
Thanks, Carl.
I thought you might like it.
I used to joke these things were leftovers from the days of hair shirts.
The church actually made shirts out of hair.
So if you wore it, you could atone just a little for your sins.
I know what a hair shirt is.
My daddy was religious.
I used to be.
If you ever want to talk about your father or about Beth Please, stop.
Whenever you're ready, I'm here.
You never even met them.
- I know you're in pain.
- You don't know shit.
You had a job.
You were there to save your flock, right? But you didn't.
You hid.
Don't act like that didn't happen.
(walkers snarling) We can take 'em.
Rick's right.
We barely have anything left.
No use in spending it all now.
I can take 'em.
Your brother was pissed, too, after what he lost.
- It made him stupid.
- We are not the same.
We never were.
But it's still the same.
It just is.
Anything? No, it's too dry.
There ain't nothing here.
Maybe we should start back.
You go.
I think she saved my life.
She saved your life, too, right? It was hers.
We're not dead.
That's what you said.
You're not dead.
I know you.
We're different.
I can't let myself-- But you I know you.
You have to let yourself feel it.
You will.
(walkers snarling) (snarling continues) (snarling continues) (grunting) Sasha.
Stay in line.
Flank her.
Keep it controlled.
Plan just got dicked.
Stop.
Just get out of here.
I told you to stop.
(panting) Carl: Dad, look.
I'm gonna head into the woods, circle back.
- May I come with? - No.
No, just me.
(snarling) (thumping) (thumping continues) Maggie.
There's one-- there's one in there.
And I shut it and it's still in there.
Okay.
(grunts) (lock clicks) (snarling) - (flesh squelches) - (snarling stops) Let's go.
(thunder rumbling) (branch snaps) Tara: So all we found was booze? Rosita: Yeah.
It's not gonna help.
He knows that.
- It's gonna make it worse.
- Yes, it is.
Eugene: He's a grown man.
And I truly do not know if things can get worse.
They can.
- (rustling) - (growling) (barking, growling) - (silenced gunshots) - (dogs whine) Your brother he tried to help me.
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.
Then you won't.
Don't think.
Just eat.
- Maggie, take a drink.
- No.
Okay.
How about you just talk to me? I never thought she was alive.
I just didn't.
After Daddy, I don't know if I couldn't.
And after what Daryl said, I hoped she was out there, alive.
And then finding out that she was and then she wasn't in the same day Seeing her like that, it-- made it feel like none of it was ever really there.
Before this was just the dark part and I don't know if I want to fight it anymore.
You do.
You do.
That's who you are.
And maybe it's a curse nowadays, but I don't think so.
We fought to be here.
And we have to keep fighting.
Drink.
You know it'll just make things worse.
The way you're going, you're what's gonna make things worse.
Hey, you're with friends.
We're not friends.
Daryl.
No, I'm all right.
Daryl.
Don't.
Hey, we can make it together.
But we can only make it together.
Tell them I went looking for water.
(sizzling) (crying) What else are we gonna do? Not this.
We don't know who left it.
If that's a trap, we already happen to be in it.
But I, for one, would like to think it is indeed from a friend.
What if it isn't? They put something in it? - Rosita: Eugene.
- Tara: What are you doing, dude? Quality assurance.
We can't.
(thunder rumbling) (thunderclap) (laughing) (laughing) Oh, God.
I'm sorry, my Lord.
Rick: Everybody get the bags.
Anything you can find.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
(thunderclap) - (Judith crying) - (thunder booming) Let's keep moving.
- There's a barn.
- Where? (thunder booming) (snarling) She had a gun.
She could have shot herself.
Some people can't give up.
Like us.
(thunder crashing) - I'll try.
- No, too wet.
Carol: He's gonna be okay.
He bounces back more than any of us do.
I used to feel sorry for kids that have to grow up now.
In this.
But I think I got it wrong.
Growing up is getting used to the world.
This is easier for them.
This isn't the world.
This isn't it.
It might be.
It might.
- That's giving up.
- It's reality.
Until we see otherwise, this is what we have to live with.
When I was a kid I asked my grandpa once if he ever killed any Germans in the war.
He wouldn't answer.
He said that was grown-up stuff, so so I asked if the Germans ever tried to kill him.
But he got real quiet.
He said he was dead the minute he stepped into enemy territory.
Every day he woke up and told himself, "Rest in peace.
Now get up and go to war.
" And then after a few years of pretending he was dead he made it out alive.
That's the trick of it, I think.
We do what we need to do and then we get to live.
But no matter what we find in DC, I know we'll be okay.
Because this is how we survive.
We tell ourselves that we are the walking dead.
We ain't them.
(branch snaps) We're not them.
Hey.
We're not.
- We ain't them.
- (thunder booms) (thunder crashing) (doors rattling) (snarling) (gasps) (thudding) (walkers snarling) (crying) (wind howling) You should get some sleep.
Yeah.
It's okay to rest now.
He was tough.
He was.
So was she.
She didn't know it, but she was.
The gearbox had some grit in it.
Thank you.
Come on.
- (door opens) - (walkers snarling) Look at this.
(snarling) Sasha: Should have torn us apart.
It didn't.
Why are we here? For this.
I see it.
Noah, that kid he said he didn't know if he can make it.
That's how I feel.
You're gonna make it.
Both of us, we will.
That's the hard part.
Daryl fixed it.
(winding up) (clicks) (sighs) You got to be kidding me.
(both laugh) Hey.
Hi.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Good morning.
My name is Aaron.
I know, this Stranger, danger, but I'm a friend.
I-I'd like to talk to the person in charge Rick, right? - How do you know? - Why? I have good news.
