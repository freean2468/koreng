Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead - Moving him could make him worse.
- What will make him better? Waking up.
I thought you were weak.
You've proved me wrong.
This is to the drug locker.
You are gonna save that woman's life.
This Dawn, she's just trying to keep it together, right? If we get a couple of her cops alive, we do an even trade.
Theirs for ours.
Everybody goes home.
I know this woman.
Let me help you.
Stop.
Stop right now.
Stop.
I won't ask again.
Oh, shit.
Son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.
Help me.
Son of a bitch.
Help me.
You crazy You crazy son of a bitch.
I think you I think you broke my back.
Didn't have to be like this.
You just had to stop.
I couldn't.
I don't know you.
But I think I think I'm getting the idea.
You just had to stop.
Take me back.
Take me back to the hospital.
I did it for your friend.
Not after this, no.
Can't go back, Bob.
I was gonna iron it over.
She's under it.
And you've been out here too long.
You'll die.
You'll all Shut up.
Please! Let me in! Please! Let me in! They're close! Help! They're coming! Please don't leave me out here! Please! Don't leave me out here! Carl! Michonne! I had to see it! I know now! Let me live with it! Oh, God, please.
- Wait.
- Help! Let me in! Oh, God, please! Help me! Help! Carl! Michonne! Get back.
Please! Help! Help! Help me! Oh, God, please! Let me in! Let me in! Help me! Please, let me in! - Please! - Come on! Help! Get back.
The rectory, come on.
That's how I got out.
Crawl under to the back.
Just go.
Take the little one and go.
Hey, hey.
You wait for me.
It's worth it.
I'm not going anywhere until you're gone.
- Come on.
- I can't run anymore.
We're not running.
He wouldn't stop.
This change things? It has to.
Maybe not.
She said the plan won't work.
The guy who did is dead.
Maybe we gotta rethink this.
They also said the cop in charge didn't have any love for him.
Maybe you did her a favor.
I don't know if they'll play ball.
Let's find out.
He was a good man.
He was attacked by rotters.
Saw it go down.
Huh.
You're a damn good liar.
We're hanging by a thread here.
He was attacked by rotters.
That's the story.
You said the trade was a bad idea.
What changed? Lamson was our shot.
So it's this or you go in guns blazing, right? You don't want that.
If this is some bullshit you're spinning - and things go south - I know.
I know the good ones from the bad.
Let us help you.
What about you? You wanna live? How much? Dawn's afraid she'll look weak in front of us.
Thinks it'll tip things against her.
Hell, it will.
She'll see this trade as a rip-off if she thinks you took out one of our guys.
So it's a good thing Lamson got aced by rotters.
Shepherd, Lamson, what's your 20? I need status on that gunfire.
Do you copy? Licari, do you copy? Does anybody copy? Damn it.
Something wrong? They don't always radio back and it drives me crazy.
Wait, no, no, no.
Beth, no, not there.
Up by the badges.
Thank you.
Is this Captain Hanson? Did someone say something about him to you? Just that he used to be in charge.
Well, you'll hear stories about him.
About me.
About what I did.
He was my mentor.
My friend.
I miss him.
That's the part the stories leave out.
What happened to him? They risk their lives every time they go out there.
It has to be worth it.
It has to matter.
He lost sight of that.
So he lost them.
Beth, in this job you don't need their love But you have to have their respect.
Otherwise, the day is gonna come when you need backup and you don't have it.
And what comes next? Everybody goes down.
Hanson lost his way.
That's what happened.
Where did you go? The school.
I had to see.
I had to know.
Where do we go? - You okay? - Yeah.
You're back.
Eugene lied.
He can't stop it.
Washington isn't the end.
Where is everybody? Beth's alive.
She's in a hospital in Atlanta.
Some people have her, but the others went to get her back.
Do we know which one? Grady Memorial.
Oh, my God.
Let's blow this joint, go save your sister.
No, Percy, tell me.
Should I use smaller words? Is the directive fix the hole in my sleeve too complicated for you? - I'm sorry.
I forgot.
- Well, here's an idea.
Don't forget.
What about you? - You any good with needle and thread? - I need her.
Sorry, we have a lot of work to do.
Come on, Beth.
Percy's going to be okay.
Nothing's okay.
Are you going to jump? I wanted to be alone.
You left your elevator key where it was.
Well, I know you're not going anywhere.
Neither are you.
You you keep telling yourself you have to do whatever it takes just until this is all over.
But it isn't over.
This is it.
This is who you are and what this place is until the end.
This place saved you.
I saved you.
Twice.
The others don't know what you did.
They think Joan was trying to get back at me and that Gorman and Jeffries were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
- That's what happened.
- Bullshit.
I saw the smashed jar.
I closed up my office and I fixed it before it could be a problem.
You're a cop killer.
- I would never kill somebody.
- But you did.
What do you think would happen if the others found out? I protected you.
And we helped that patient.
I didn't have to, I wanted to.
But there's a way things have to happen here.
Don't you get that? What are you gonna do? No, Dawn, what are you gonna do? Starting with her.
She's my ward.
It's my call.
Fine, but your people deserve to know who they're working for.
So, you gonna tell them or am I? You don't get to threaten me.
That's not a threat.
But these are the facts.
You look like shit.
The guys are talking.
They think you're cracking.
This is Hanson all over again.
It's time to make a change.
O'Donnell.
You're wrong.
I'm nothing like Hanson.
I was the one who killed him, remember that? I was the only one who could go through with it.
Lower your weapon, Dawn.
All I have to do is shout.
All I have to do is say you came at me.
Beth, get out of the way.
You're not gonna do this.
You're not giving me a choice.
Go.
We were rookies together.
You knew my wife.
You were here in this hospital having cigars with me in the parking lot when my kid was born.
Don't.
That guy is gone.
We're supposed to protect people.
To help them.
But look at you.
You're beating the old man.
You're laughing with your buddies about that poor girl getting raped.
- That's who you are now.
- So who the hell are you? Somebody who's not gonna let it happen anymore.
That's not what this is about.
It's about holding on to what you have.
What the hell do I have? This isn't you.
After Hanson, you changed.
You think you're better than us?! Stay in your lane, bitch! Beth! Thank you.
It's okay to cry.
I don't cry anymore.
I do.
I just don't let them see it.
It's from my own stash.
There's no strings.
I know now why you covered for me.
You weren't protecting me.
You were protecting yourself.
Is that so? Gorman, Jeffries, O'Donnell they were problems for you.
And now they're not.
And you didn't have to do the dirty work.
That's how things get done here.
Everyone uses people to get what they want.
You're not the ones who have to remember.
Is that what happened with Edwards and Trevitt? He used you? I'm gonna get out.
Just like Noah.
He'll be back.
- He's going home.
- They always come back.
They don't ever get far because they can't.
But really they don't want to.
He's going home.
I was like you when I was younger.
Nobody could tell me anything.
I'm not stupid.
You know her.
And somehow you both wound up here.
Maybe that means something.
Beth, you can be a part of this thing.
Both of you.
This is important.
Maybe the most important thing you do in your life.
And what you did back there Gorman and O'Donnell hurt people.
The world didn't lose anything when they died.
And you're wrong about what happened.
I didn't use you.
And I will remember.
You're beating yourself up.
Don't.
I was stupid.
At the church, that guy you killed, his name was Martin.
We had him.
Me and Carol.
Back by Terminus.
Then she went in after you all and it was just me and him.
I said I killed him.
I could have done it, maybe I should have done it, but I didn't.
I keep thinking about it.
I remember when we were kids and you used to follow me around, copying every little thing I did.
What happened to both of us, maybe it's because we're still the same.
Just like we were back then.
And maybe that's good.
You're still the same.
And that is good.
I don't think I can be.
Not anymore.
Not anymore.
They're headed towards the vantage point.
Okay.
Copy that.
Officer Franco.
Officer McGinley.
I'm Rick Grimes.
I was a deputy in the King County Sheriff's Department.
I'm here to make a proposal.
Lay your weapon on the ground.
All right.
What's your proposal? You have two of my people, I have two of yours.
We want to make an exchange.
Then we'll be on our way.
No one gets hurt.
- Who? - Officers Shepherd and Licari for Beth and Carol.
You picked up a woman yesterday after your people hit her with a car.
Noah, he's with you? That's how you know? Yes, he is.
What about Officer Lamson? He was attacked by the dead before we got to him.
Where are your people? They're close.
Radio your lieutenant.
I'll wait.
Holster your weapons.
You, too.
They haven't been harmed.
Where's Lamson? Rotters got him.
We saw it go down.
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He was one of the good guys.
One of yours for one of mine.
All right.
Move.
Glad we could work things out.
Yeah.
Now I just need Noah.
And then you can leave.
That wasn't part of the deal.
Noah was my ward.
Beth took his place and I'm losing her, so I need him back.
- Ma'am, please, it's not - Shepherd! My officers put their lives on the line to find him.
One of them died.
No, he ain't staying.
He's one of mine.
You have no claim on him.
The boy wants to go home, so you have no claim on him.
Well, then we don't have a deal.
The deal is done.
- It's okay.
- No.
No.
I got to do it.
It's not okay.
It's settled.
Wait! It's okay.
I knew you'd be back.
I get it now.
No! Hold your fire! It's over.
It was just about her.
Stand down.
You can stay.
We're surviving here.
It's better than out there.
No.
And I'm taking anyone back there who wants to leave.
If you want to come with us just step forward now.
