Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead Someone knows what you did at the prison.
They accepted.
They don't have to.
No, they do.
I owe you everything.
I sent you away and now we're joining you.
Will you have us? - What are you doing? - I don't know.
They got Beth! Come on, get in.
(engine starts) Good Lord, take my hand I've dried up this promised land Afraid that the sun won't rise for me (crying) Good Lord, hear my cries I've run out of wasted time Dead just floating out to sea (snarling) Go away! 'Cause I got bad blood Go away! (car engine starts) (tires screech) Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Good Lord, find my soul Waiting to be whole Hold those gates if I don't make it out tonight - (rattles) - Good Lord, give me peace From a lifelong of pain and greed But not yet, I'm not done paying For my crimes Bad blood I got bad blood You don't want none Of what I have Don't listen to any word I say I'd say anything to make you feel okay I'm not who I thought I was Not today 'Cause I got bad blood Bad blood You don't want none Of what I have.
(theme music playing) So it was just you and Beth after? - Daryl: Yeah.
- You save her? She's tough.
She saved herself.
We were out there for a while.
We got cornered, she got out in front of me and I don't know, she was gone.
I came out and a car's pulling out with a white cross on the window.
- Just like that one? - Yep.
(snarling) Daryl: Rick's gonna wonder where we went.
Tank's runnin' low.
We can end this quick.
Just run him off the road.
Nah, we're good for a bit.
If they're holding her somewhere, we can get it out of the driver.
Yeah, but if he don't talk, we're back to square one.
Right now we got the advantage.
We'll see who they are.
If they're a group, see what they can do.
And then we'll do what we gotta do to get her back.
They're heading north, I-85.
(walker snarling) What the hell's he waiting for? There's two of 'em.
Is that a cop? They might've seen us.
(snarling) (sighs) (thudding) (snarling, thudding continue) (car engine sputters) Aw, shit! Tank's tapped.
They'd have taken the bypass and they didn't.
They must be holed up in the city somewhere.
(walkers snarling) We gotta move, find someplace to hole up till sunlight.
I know a place just a couple of blocks from here.
We can make it.
- (flesh squelches) - (rapid tapping) - Two more.
- I almost got it.
(walkers snarling) Come on.
(walkers snarling) You used to work here or something? Something.
(doorknob rattles) (mutters) - Daryl: What's this place? - It's temporary housing.
You came here? We didn't stay.
I'll take the top bunk.
I think that one's more your style.
(chuckles) You should sleep.
I'll take first watch.
- This is locked up pretty tight.
- I know.
Then we're good, then.
I'll keep first watch.
I don't mind.
Suit yourself.
You said we get to start over.
Yeah.
Did you? I'm tryin'.
Why don't you say what's really on your mind? I don't think we get to save people anymore.
Then why are you here? I'm tryin'.
When we were out by the car what if I didn't show up? I still don't know.
(distant banging) (distant banging) (snarling) You don't have to.
You don't.
(birds chirping) Thank you.
Daryl: That car was headed downtown.
I say we get up in one of the tall ones, get ourselves a view, see what we see.
We can stay close to the buildings and keep quiet, but sooner or later, we're gonna be drawing 'em.
(walkers snarling) (walkers snarling) (snarling) All right, we can get up there.
There's a bridge.
(snarling continues) (snarls) (walkers snarling) (walkers snarling) Some days, I don't know what the hell to think.
Good thing we skipped breakfast.
(whistles) How did we get here? Mm-mm.
We just did.
You still haven't asked me what happened.
After I met up with Tyreese, the girls.
Yeah, I know what happened.
They ain't here.
It was worse than that.
The reason I said we get to start over is because we gotta.
The way it was Yeah.
You see something? I don't know.
Hand me that rifle.
Right there.
It's been there a while.
Definitely one of 'em.
It's definitely some kind of lead.
We should fill up.
All right.
Hmm.
What? I bet this cost some rich prick a lot of money.
Looks like a dog sat in paint, wiped its ass all over the place.
Really? I kinda like it.
(laughs) Stop.
I'm serious.
You don't know me.
Yep, you keep tellin' yourself that.
(walkers snarling) - Daryl, don't.
- Get up.
Hands up, both of you.
Lay down your crossbow.
You got some sack on you.
Look, nobody has to get hurt.
I just need weapons, that's it.
So, please, lay down your crossbow.
Back up.
- Sorry about this.
- (walker snarling) You look tough.
You'll be all right.
(snarling) (gunshot) (door closes) (chains rattle) Three bullets.
We're in the middle of a city.
He was stealing our weapons.
Did you think I was gonna kill him? I was aiming for his leg.
Could that have killed him? Maybe, I don't know.
But he was stealing our weapons.
He's a damn kid.
Without weapons we could die.
Beth could die.
We'll find more weapons.
I don't want you to die.
I don't want Beth to die.
I don't want anybody at the church to die, but I can't stand around and watch it happen either.
I can't.
That's why I left.
I just had to be somewhere else.
Well, you ain't somewhere else; you're right here.
Tryin'.
Look, you're not who you were and neither am I.
(exhales) I don't know if I believe in God anymore or heaven, but if I'm going to hell, I'm making damn sure I'm holding it off as long as I can.
(items clatter) (door opens) All right, let's get this done.
It's not stable.
I'm lighter.
(grunts) (snarling) (Carol grunts) (rattling) (walkers snarling) There's more coming.
We're gonna have to fight through.
Yeah, I see 'em.
- We have to go.
- GMH, what's that? A hospital? I don't know.
Grady Memorial, maybe? Grady, the white crosses-- it might be where they're holing up.
(snarling) - Carol: Daryl! - (knife piercing) Daryl: Go, go, go, go! (knife piercing) Anything we can use? Nothin' but what we got.
Daryl: All right, buckle up.
(snarling) You hold on.
(snarling continues faintly) - (Daryl groans) - We're okay.
We're okay.
(bodies thudding) God.
(groans) Ow.
(walker snarling) Here.
I'm fine.
Prove it.
How bad is it? I've had worse.
Damn, that was stupid.
We made good time down.
(scoffs) There's only three blocks between us and Grady.
We need to find a place nearby, scope it out, see what we can see.
You really think we're gonna find out what we need to know just by watching? It's where we start.
Come on.
(snarling weakly) (snarling stops) It's them.
All right.
Let's see what we see.
(crunching) You said I ain't like how I was before? Yeah.
How was I? It's like you were a kid.
Now you're a man.
What about you? Me and Sophia stayed at that shelter for a day and a half before I went running back to Ed.
I went home, I got beat up, life went on, and I just kept praying for something to happen.
But I didn't do anything.
Not a damn thing.
Who I was with him she got burned away.
And I was happy about that.
I mean, not happy, but And at the prison I got to be who I always thought I should be, thought I should've been.
And then she got burned away.
Everything now just consumes you.
Well, hey we ain't ashes.
(distant door closes) (thudding) (walker snarling) (thudding continues) (snarling continues) Is that yours? Yeah.
- (automatic gunfire) - (walker snarling) (yelling) (groans) Oh, God.
I'm good.
I'm good.
You go.
God.
(panting) (man grunting) - (snarling) - (groaning, gasping) Plea-- please.
I had to protect myself.
- Why you followin' us? - I-I didn't, I swear! I thought you followed me.
Bullshit.
(walker continues snarling) Noah: Come on, man.
Plea-- please! (groans) - Please, please.
- Nah, I already helped you once.
It ain't happenin' again.
(walker continues snarling) Have fun with Hoss over there.
Noah: No.
No, no, no.
No.
No, no, no! Please! Please! Please! I'm sorry, please! - Please! Please, please! - Daryl.
Daryl.
Stop.
You almost died 'cause of him! But I didn't.
Nah, let him be.
- Noah: I'm sorry.
Please, I'm sorry! - Daryl! (yelling) (snarling) (grunting) Come on, just a little more.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(panting) Daryl: You okay? You okay? I'm still here.
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
They're gonna come.
They probably heard the shot.
If they find me - Who? - Them, people at the hospital.
Wait, wait, wait, just tell us-- is there a blonde girl there? - You see a blonde girl? - Beth? You know her? She helped me get out, but she's still there.
They're coming.
We gotta go now.
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
The building next door has a basement.
It's clear.
We'll be safe.
Ah! Ah! Daryl: Go, I got him.
Come on, get up.
- Get up.
- (groans) Okay.
(tires screech) No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! - Let go of me! - Wait! They can help her.
They're the only ones who can.
They have medicine, machines, a doctor.
You go out there, you'll have to kill them, okay? And then she can't get their help.
Is that what you want? (panting) We can get her back.
We can get Beth back.
What's it gonna take? A lot.
They got guns, people.
So do we.
(snarling)
