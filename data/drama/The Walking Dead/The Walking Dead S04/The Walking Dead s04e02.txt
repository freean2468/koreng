Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead They don't spread out anymore.
It's manageable, but not for long.
We're glad to see you.
- You gonna stay a little while? - Just a little while.
Just thought I could get to know you.
You did.
Talking about knives-- how to use them and how they can save your live.
Ma'am, may I be dismissed? I'm not feeling very well.
What are you thinking about? Yesterday.
Zack.
I can't stop.
Yeah, me neither.
It used to be we all had acquaintances.
Just people moving in and out of your life.
No big.
See them down the road sometime.
Now a handful of people you know, and that's it.
They might as well be the only people left in the world.
Am I talking too much? A little, but I like it.
I got you - Under my skin - Mmm I got you Deep in the heart of me Okay, now you're just embarrassing me.
So deep in my heart That you are really a part of me.
I got you.
We should probably try to get some rest.
Yeah.
Hey, come crash at my place.
Okay, I'll crash at your place, then.
You know we start doing that, we're not gonna want to stop.
Not just yet.
Yeah.
Good night.
Carl? Carl.
Come on.
Sorry.
Changing of the guard? Yeah.
I'll bring you breakfast after perimeter check.
Oh, my God.
Throw that away.
Yeah.
Not gonna happen.
It's mine.
Careful out there.
Always am.
Any requests? Books? Comics? Some stale M&Ms? You're the one that likes stale M&Ms.
Then I'll definitely looking for some.
I'll look for some stuff you like, too.
Why don't you wear your hat anymore? It's not a farming hat.
See you soon? Pretty soon.
They only took out one cluster yesterday.
Probably gonna need more people today.
Maybe we could help.
I got other plans involving dirt and cucumbers and keeping people fed.
Well, if you don't want to, maybe I could.
Could I? We have other plans.
That's what I should have said.
Come on in.
There we go.
Dad I'm sorry.
I've been trying.
Yeah, I know.
And I'm proud.
Dad, when can I have my gun back? Worms will give them some extra protein.
Stay close.
Help! Help! Please, come quick! - Cell blocks? - I don't know! Get in the tower with Maggie.
Don't argue, go! - Walkers in D! - What about C? Clear.
We locked the gates to the tombs.
- Hershel's on guard.
- It ain't a breach.
We followed the plan.
Whoa, boy.
Hold on! Come here.
- Move! - Daryl! I got it.
Are you bit? Go.
Get out of here.
Hold that.
Go, go.
Are you bit? All right, go.
Get up.
Get back in the cell.
Here.
Come with me.
Stay in there.
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Got you.
Go! Karen! Karen! - Are you okay? - You all right? Just stay calm.
I'm gonna have to amputate your arm to stop the infection from spreading.
Check all of 'em-- every cell.
I have to do it now.
I want you to bite this.
- Are we clear down here? - Yeah.
- We're safe? - Yeah, yeah.
Up here! It's okay.
Get down! Thanks.
Oh, it's Patrick.
That's all of 'em.
I got it.
Whew It's happening, isn't it? You're in shock, okay? I want you just to lay back.
Lizzie and Mica, you care about them.
I've seen it.
I don't have anybody else.
Kids on their own, they don't have a chance.
Can you look out for them? Like they're yours? Yeah.
Yeah, I can.
I will.
Ryan.
You're gonna have to let them say goodbye.
Okay? Okay.
No bites.
No wounds.
I think he just died.
Horribly, too.
Pleurisy aspiration.
Choked to death on his own blood.
Caused those trails down his face.
I've seen them before on a walker outside the fences.
I saw them on Patrick, too.
They're from the internal lung pressure building up-- like if you shake a soda can and pop the top.
Only imagine your eyes, ears, nose, and throat are the top.
It's a sickness from the walkers? No, these things happened before they were around.
Could be pneumococcal.
Most likely an aggressive flu strain.
Someone locked him in just in time.
No, man.
Charlie used to sleepwalk.
Locked himself in.
Hell, he was just eating barbecue yesterday.
How could somebody die in a day just from a cold? I had a sick pig, it died quick.
Saw a sick boar in the woods.
Pigs and birds.
That's how these things spread in the past.
We need to do something about those hogs.
Maybe we got lucky.
Maybe these two cases are it.
Haven't seen anybody be lucky in a long time.
Bugs like to run through close quarters.
Doesn't get any closer than this.
All of us in here, we've all been exposed.
Dad? We have to go get Dr.
S.
Honey, he's been bit.
The doctor won't help.
You take care of your sister.
Dad.
Dad? - Dad? - No.
- Come on, it's time.
- No.
You know what I have to do.
What we're always supposed to do.
You can wait outside if you want.
Okay? We should be the ones.
No.
I can't.
Lizzie, are you sure? You taught us.
- I can do it.
- Okay, well, you have to do it now.
You need to do it right now because you have to do it before he turns.
I'm gonna stay right here.
You remember what I showed you? Lizzie.
Lizzie, Lizzie.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Lizzie? Lizzie, it's okay.
Breathe.
Look at the flowers.
Count one, two, three with me.
- One, two-- - Daddy, no! No, Lizzie, look at the flowers.
Count one, two, three with me.
- One, two, three.
- Look at the flowers, Lizzie.
- No! - Look at the flowers! Hey, you might want to stay back.
- Carl.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you come out.
It's okay.
I'm here.
I'm fine.
But back away.
I had to use one of the guns by the gate.
I swear I didn't want to.
I was coming back.
I fell.
They came out and helped me.
Are you all right? What happened in there? Patrick got sick last night.
It's some kind of flu.
It moves fast.
We think he died and attacked the cell block.
Look, I know he was your friend and I'm sorry.
He was a good kid.
We lost a lot of good people.
Glenn and your dad are okay, but they were in there.
You shouldn't get too close to anyone that might have been exposed, at least for a little while.
Carl.
All of you.
Patrick was fine yesterday, and he died overnight.
Two people died that quick? We'll have to separate everyone that's been exposed.
That's everyone in that cell block.
That's all of us.
Maybe more.
We know that this sickness can be lethal.
We don't know how easily it spreads.
Is anyone else showing symptoms that we know of? We can't just wait and see.
And there's children.
It isn't just the illness.
If people die, they become a threat.
We need a place for them to go.
They can't stay in D.
We can't risk going in there to clean it up.
We can use cell block A.
Death row? I'm not sure that's much of an upgrade.
It's clean.
That's an upgrade.
Think that'll work for Dr.
S? I'll help Caleb get it set up.
- You okay? - Mm-hmm.
You sure? You don't sound so good.
We're just taking her back to my cell so she can rest.
Tyreese, I don't think that's a good idea.
Why? What's going on now? We think it's a flu or something.
That's how Patrick died.
Judith was in that cell block.
She's vulnerable.
Anyone that may be sick or even exposed should stay away.
- It killed Patrick? - She's gonna be okay.
Now that we know what Patrick died from we can treat it, right? Don't panic.
We're going to figure this out.
But we should keep you separated in the meantime.
We'll have Caleb take a look at you.
I'll see what we have in the way of medications.
David from the Decatur group, he's been coughing, too.
I'll get him.
There's some empty clean cells in the tombs, right? - Yeah, we'll meet you there.
- Okay.
Come on.
Let's get you settled.
Have to call another meeting later.
All right.
I'll get to burying the dead ones.
You wear gloves and a mask.
Uh-huh.
You all right? I'm worried about Lizzie and Mica.
They were around Patrick.
We all were.
Karen and David are gonna be separated till they feel better.
You're right.
Are you okay? Mm-hmm.
Got to be.
Gonna bury your dad.
You can visit, bring him flowers.
Lizzie, we're gonna have to talk about what happened in there.
Your daddy asked me to protect you like you're my own and I will.
It's time someone told you the truth.
Honey, you're weak.
You lost your nerve.
You have to trust your gut and you have to act fast every time.
That's life and death.
He's dead.
I know, and I'm sorry.
But if you want to live, you have to become strong.
He's dead.
He's dead.
He was special and now he's dead.
Why'd they kill him? Why'd they kill Nick? You're so stupid.
Nick? She's messed up.
She's not weak.
Glad you were in there.
Wasn't much use without my gun.
No, you were.
All this time you've been taking off, you earned it.
We wouldn't be here without you.
It was all of us.
No, it was you first.
You gonna help us figure this out? I screwed up too many times.
Those calls you got to make, I start down that road I almost lost my boy-- who he was.
Whatever else this place needs, I'm here for it.
Like I said, you earned it.
But for what it's worth, you see mistakes.
I see when the shit hits, you're standing there with a shovel.
Rick! Daryl! Oh, shit.
The noise drew 'em out and now this part's starting to give.
Did you see anything? They just started taking out the dead.
I don't need to know who yet.
I don't want to.
I'm glad you came back safe.
It was stupid.
I was so stupid.
When I fell on my ass, they should have just left me out there.
Now that's stupid.
We care about you.
They could have gotten hurt.
When you care about people hurt is kind of part of the package.
Were there any kids? Got all these widows and orphans, but what do you call someone who lost a child? You'd think someone would have given that a name.
Are you okay? Does she always cry like that? I think she senses people's moods.
Don't.
We're supposed to stay away from each other.
Are you seeing this? Is someone feeding these things? - Heads up.
- This part of the fence, now! Hold on, hold on.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's gonna give! It's gonna give! Everybody back! Come on, back, now.
The fence keeps bending in like that, those walkers are coming over it.
Daryl, get the truck.
I know what to do.
You know if Patrick was Catholic? He said he was a practicing atheist.
Did you tell your dad what you saw in the library yesterday? Nope.
Are you going to tell him? I have to keep teaching those kids to survive.
You know that.
Did you tell their parents? No.
Are you gonna tell them? If I do, maybe after this they'll understand.
But maybe they won't.
I don't want to take that risk.
That's between you and them.
No.
It's between you and me.
If you tell your dad, he'll tell them.
And like I said, maybe they'll understand, maybe they won't.
I don't want to lie to my dad.
I'm not asking you to lie.
I'm asking you not to say anything.
Lying in my bed at night I don't want to grow up Nothing ever seems to turn out right I don't want to grow up How do you live in a world of fog? It's always changing things Makes me wish that I could be a dog Oh, when I see the price you pay I don't want to grow up Nothing ever seems to go my way I don't want to grow up Only thing to live for is today-- Some lullaby.
I just sing her what I like.
I figure it's better than ashes or cradles falling out of trees.
Oh, shoot.
Can you hold her a second? - Please, I'm covered in carrots.
- No.
Thanks.
Ready? Let's go.
Go! All right! Hold up! All right, go.
Go.
Lizzie, those are walkers.
Nick was a walker.
You don't feel bad about that walker dying.
You feel bad about your dad.
You loved him and he's gone.
Yeah.
There.
Not this time.
Think the pigs made them sick? Or we made the pigs sick.
I think we should stay away from Judy a while.
- Just in case.
- Okay.
- I don't like it, but-- - We have to protect her.
Yes, we do.
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah? Carol's been teaching the kids how to use weapons.
How to kill.
Their parents don't know and she doesn't want you to know.
I think you should let her.
I know you're gonna say it's not up to you.
But it can be.
Dad? Thank you for telling me.
Yeah.
I won't stop her.
I won't say anything.
Carl?
