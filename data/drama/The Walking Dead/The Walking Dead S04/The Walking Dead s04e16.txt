You can't keep me from it.
From what? From what always happens.
Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead What was your son's name? Andre.
What we're willing to do is not my call.
I got another plans involving dirt and cucumbers.
We can all live together, and nobody dies.
Liar.
No! We've all done the worst kinds of things just to stay alive! Hi, Daddy.
You're a sight for sore eyes.
- Doing okay? - Yeah.
Yes, sir.
- Any trouble? - No.
- You had some.
- Yeah.
A little.
Carol, I'll take that.
How hungry are you, scale of one to 10? Yeah.
Well, it's been a while.
I'm gonna go check the snares.
Can I go with you? Well, how else are you gonna learn? Hey, you, too.
We'll stay another day or two.
Get some more rest.
Finish healing up? I'm almost there.
We're close now, right? To Terminus? - Yeah.
- We are.
When we get there, are we gonna tell them? Tell them what? Everything that's happened to us.
All the stuff we've done.
Are we gonna tell them the truth? We're gonna tell them who we are.
But how do you say that? I mean who are we? There you go.
It's a small one.
It'll do.
So, this is just a simple slipknot.
Tie one on both ends, then you tighten one side to a branch.
Now, you see how the ground here is sort of like a funnel shape? - It's a trail? - That's right.
That's where you want to set the noose.
So you hide it with leaves.
Then you put sticks all around it so any animals going by have to run this way right into the trap.
Help! - Somebody help! - Carl.
- Carl, stop! Carl! - Get back! Back! Help! Get away! Get back! Help! Somebody help! Help me! Get away! No! Get away! - Help! Somebody help! - We can't help him.
No! No! No! No! We've got to go.
Morning.
Everything okay? Yeah, just want a little help with something.
What time is it? I never know what time it is anymore.
Ever since I gave Glenn my watch, it's always right now to me.
It's early.
He's decent.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Bethy's gonna take Judith.
What are we doing? You'll see.
You're not going to need that.
It'll just get in the way.
Let's go.
Thought maybe there'd be some houses down this way.
Maybe even a store.
There's got to be some food around here somewhere.
Hey, look.
That was one small rabbit.
It was something.
Got to hand it to the thing.
It traveled well.
Have you noticed that's all we talk about anymore? Food.
I forgot what this feels like.
Me, too.
I hope we're able to forget again soon.
We're close.
Just got to make it through another day.
If folks there are taking people in, they have to be strong.
They have to have a system.
I wonder if the whole thing's legit.
We let people in.
We did.
So did the Governor.
Yeah, it's always the same, isn't it? Don't get to know until we know.
Maybe this place isn't even there anymore.
Oh, dearie me.
You screwed up, asshole.
You hear me? You screwed up.
Today is a day of reckoning, sir.
Restitution.
A balancing of the whole damn universe.
Shit, and I was thinking of turning in for the night on New Year's Eve.
Now who's gonna count down the ball dropper with me, huh? Nine Mississippi.
- Eight Mississippi.
- Joe! - Hold up.
- You're stopping me on eight, Daryl.
Just hold up.
This is the guy that killed Lou, so we got nothing to talk about.
The thing about nowadays is we got nothing but time.
Say your piece, Daryl.
These people, you're gonna let 'em go.
These are good people.
Now, I think Lou would disagree with you on that.
I'll, of course, have to speak for him and all 'cause your friend here strangled him in a bathroom.
You want blood, I get it.
Take it from me, man.
Come on.
This man killed our friend.
You say he's good people.
See, now that right there is a lie.
It's a lie! - Come on.
- No! Teach him, fellas.
Teach him all the way.
- No! - Come here, boy.
You leave him be! Shh.
You'll get yours.
You just wait your turn.
Listen, it was me.
It was just me.
See, now that's right.
That's not some damn lie.
Look, we can settle this.
We're reasonable men.
First, we're gonna beat Daryl to death.
Then we'll have the girl.
Then the boy.
Then I'm gonna shoot you and then we'll be square.
Let him go.
Stop your squirming.
Let him go.
I got him.
Oh, it's gonna be so much worse now.
Shh.
Come on, get up! Come on.
Let's see what you got.
Shh.
- Get away from him before I-- - Huh? Right over here.
What the hell are you gonna do now, sport? I'll kill him.
I'll-- I'll kill him! Let the boy go.
He's mine.
Stay back.
Stay-- Please-- Here.
What is? Those feral pigs in the forest, it doesn't take much to domesticate them.
Same with the horses we've seen.
We have seeds.
We can grow our own food.
It's time we started planting.
Okay.
Can't do it myself.
I got to go out there.
Go on runs, be at the fences.
I teach you how to do this.
You teach Carl.
We're going to be here a while.
They need me.
We've been here two months.
You've made it work.
The war is over, Rick.
No, we don't know that.
I'm talking about you.
I'm saying it, and I'm saying this, you pull Carl back from going out there, fine.
- He shot that boy.
- Yeah, I know.
He needs his father.
He needs his father to show him the way.
What way are you going to show him? He can shoot, we know that.
What's his life going to be? What's yours? All this.
I'm just saying everything because I owe you.
We all owe you.
We can make this better now.
Things changing in here doesn't change things out there.
No, it doesn't.
But we're here today, right now.
This is a good place to start.
There's a run soon.
- I got to go.
- No, you don't.
We should save it to drink.
You can't see yourself, he can.
I didn't know what they were.
How'd you wind up with them? I was with Beth.
We got out together.
I was with her for a while.
Is she dead? She's just gone.
After that, that's when they found me.
I mean, I knew they were bad, but they had a code.
It was simple.
Stupid, but it was something.
It was enough.
And you were alone.
They said they were looking for some guy.
Last night they said they spotted him.
I was hanging back.
I was gonna leave.
But I stayed.
That's when I saw it was you three.
Right when you saw me.
I didn't know what they could do.
It's not on you, Daryl.
Hey.
It's not on you.
You being back with us here, now, that's everything.
You're my brother.
Hey, what you did last night anybody would have done that.
No, not that.
Something happened.
That ain't you.
Daryl, you saw what I did to Tyreese.
It ain't all of it, but that's me.
That's why I'm here now.
That's why Carl is.
I want to keep him safe.
That's all that matters.
You okay? Yeah.
I'm okay.
I know.
How? 'Cause I'm okay, too.
We're getting close.
Be there before sundown.
Now we head through the woods.
We don't know who they are.
All right.
We all spread out, watch for a while, see what we see, and get ready.
We all stay close.
You want to stick with me? It's all right.
Why didn't you go with your dad? When I told you about Andre, you never asked how he died.
I knew why.
Yeah, but the how is important.
We went to a refugee camp.
Andre and my boyfriend Mike, that was Andre's father, and our friend Terry.
At the camp, it just got worse and worse.
People were leaving.
People giving up.
But I didn't.
I was coming back from a run.
I saw the fences were down.
I heard the moans.
It was over.
And Mike and Terry, they were high when it happened.
They were bit.
Could have stopped it.
Could have killed them.
But I let them turn.
I made it so they couldn't bite, couldn't scratch.
I tied chains around their necks.
It was insane.
It was sick.
It felt like what I deserved, dragging them around so that I would always know.
I found out that they kept me safe.
They hid me.
The walkers didn't see me anymore.
I was just another monster.
And I was.
Me.
I was gone for a long time.
But then Andrea brought me back.
Your dad brought me back.
You did.
I see how you've been looking at your dad.
You don't have to be afraid of me or him.
He told me the other day that he was proud of me.
That I was a good man.
I'm not.
- Carl.
- I know more now.
About what he wanted from me.
And I tried, but I still have these thoughts.
I'm not what he thinks I am.
I'm just another monster, too.
Just in case.
Terminus-- those who arrive survive.
Follow the tracks to the point where all lines intersect.
There are maps at the crossings to help guide you with your journey.
Sanctuary for all.
Community for all.
Those who arrive survive.
Terminus, sanctuary for all.
- Community for all.
- Hello.
Those who s-- Hello.
Well, I bet Albert is on perimeter watch.
You here to rob us? No.
We wanted to see you before you saw us.
Makes sense.
Usually we do this where the tracks meet.
Ahem.
Welcome to Terminus.
I'm Gareth.
Looks like you've been on the road for a good bit.
We have.
Rick.
That's Carl, Daryl, Michonne.
You're nervous.
I get it.
We were all the same way.
We came here for sanctuary.
That what you're here for? Yes.
Good.
You found it.
Hey, Alex.
This isn't as pretty as the front.
We got nothing to hide, but welcome wagon is a whole lot nicer.
Alex will take you, ask you a few questions.
Uh, but first, we need to see everyone's weapons.
If you could just lay them down in front of you.
All right.
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yes, I do.
I'd hate to see the other guy.
You would.
- They deserve it? - Yes.
Just so you know, we aren't those kind of people, but we aren't stupid either.
And you shouldn't be stupid enough to try anything stupid.
As long as everyone's clear on that, we shouldn't have any problems.
Just solutions.
Okay.
Follow me.
So how long's this place been here? Since almost the start.
When all the camps got overrun, people started finding this place.
I think it was instinct, you know? Follow a path.
Some folks were heading to the coast, others out west or up north, but they all wound up here.
Hi.
Heard you came in the back door.
Smart.
You'll fit right in here.
Hey, Mary, would you fix each of these new folks a plate for me? Why do you do it? Why do you let people in? The more people become a part of us, we get stronger.
That's why we put up the signs, invite people in.
It's how we survive.
Here.
No.
Where the hell did you get this watch? - Hey, Patrick.
- Hey, Mr.
Grimes.
Thanks for grabbing these.
Well, I thought Carl might want 'em.
They were just sitting there.
I figured it had been a while.
I'm not ashamed that they're for ages four to 12.
You shouldn't be.
Hey.
Hey.
- Carl.
- Yes? Carl.
I need your help with something.
Leave it behind.
What? It'll just get in the way.
Where the hell did you get this watch? You want answers? You want anything else? You get 'em when you put down the gun.
I see your man on the roof with a sniper rifle.
How good's his aim? Where'd you get the watch? - Where'd you get the watch?! - Don't do anything! I have this! You just put it down.
You put it down! You want to listen to me.
There's a lot of us.
Where did you get the watch? I got it off of a dead one.
I didn't think he'd need it.
What about the riot gear? The poncho? Got the riot gear off a dead cop.
Found the poncho on a clothesline.
- Gareth, we can wait.
- Shut up, Alex.
You talk to me.
What's there left to say? You don't trust us anymore.
- Gareth.
- Shut up.
- Gareth, please.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Rick, what do you want? Where are our people? You didn't answer the question.
- Go, go! - Hey! Carl! Get down, now! Go! Shots fired in the main.
Heading into the building.
Come on! Come on! Here! Stay on your shot.
- Come on, this way.
- Get them off B! - Help! Help! - What the hell? Let us out! - Help! - Keep going.
Help! What the hell is this place? These people, I don't think they're trying to kill us.
No, they were aiming at our feet.
There.
There.
Go! Drop your weapons! Now! Now! Ringleader, go to your left.
The train car, go.
You do what we say, the boy goes with you.
Anything else, he dies and you end up in there anyway.
Now the archer.
Now the samurai.
Stand at the door, ringleader, archer, samurai, in that order.
My son.
Go, kid.
Ringleader, open the door and go in.
I'll go in with him.
Don't make us kill him now.
Rick? You're here.
You're here.
They're our friends.
They helped save us.
Yeah.
Now they're friends of ours.
For however long that'll be.
No.
There you go, Judith.
There you go.
Put it in at more of an angle.
Whoa.
Gonna have to get you a farming hat.
There's a new sheriff in town.
- How's it look? - Looks good.
It can be like this all the time.
It's like this now.
That's enough.
They're gonna feel pretty stupid when they find out.
Find out what? They're screwing with the wrong people.
