Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead I don't cry any more, Daryl.
Are you okay? Just tired of losing people, so? I'm low on the ammo.
Run by the bus.
I'll cover you.
Beth! Where is Beth? I'm just trying to find the kids, to get them on the bus.
We gotta go back.
We gotta go.
We aren't the only survivors.
We can't be.
Come on.
Come on.
I need a drink.
No, I mean a real drink.
As in alcohol.
I've never had one.
'Cause of my dad.
But he's not exactly around anymore, so I thought we could go find some.
Okay.
Well, enjoy your snake jerky.
Jerk.
I think we made it a way.
I'm pretty sure we got to go that way to find the booze.
What the hell? You brought me back.
I'm not staying in this suck-ass camp.
Hey! You had your fun.
What the hell is wrong with you? Do you feel anything? Yeah, you think everything's screwed.
I guess that's a feeling.
So you want to spend the rest of our lives staring into a fire and eating mud snakes? Screw that.
We might as well do something.
I can take care of myself and I'm gonna get a damn drink.
Golfers like to booze it up, right? Come on.
Might be people inside.
Come on.
Why are you keeping all that stuff? Come on.
Thanks for the help.
You said you could take care of yourself.
You did.
_ _ Help me take her down.
It don't matter.
She's dead.
It does matter.
Here.
Okay.
Move.
We made it.
I know you think this is stupid.
And it probably is.
But I don't care.
All I wanted to do today was lay down and cry, but we don't get to do that.
So beat up on walkers if that makes you feel better.
I need to do this.
Did you have to break the glass? No.
You have your drink yet? No.
But I found this.
Peach schnapps.
- Is it good? - No.
Well, it's the only thing left.
Who needs a glass? Ain't gonna have your first drink be no damned peach schnapps.
Come on.
A motorcycle mechanic.
- Huh? - That's my guess.
For what you were doing before the turn.
Did Zack ever guess that one? It don't matter.
Hasn't mattered for a long time.
It's just what people talk about, you know, to feel normal.
Yeah, well, that never felt normal to me.
Found this place with Michonne.
I was expecting a liquor store.
No, this is better.
What's that? Moonshine.
Come on.
All right.
That's a real first drink right there.
What's the matter? Nothing.
It's just my dad always said bad moonshine can make you go blind.
Ain't nothing worth seeing out there anymore anyway.
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.
Second round's better.
Slow down.
- This one's for you.
- No, I'm good.
- Why? - Someone's got to keep watch.
So, what, you're like my chaperone now? Just drink lots of water.
Yes, Mr.
Dixon.
Who'd go into a store and walk out with this? My dad, that's who.
Oh, he's a dumbass.
He'd set those up on top of the TV set, use them as target practice.
He shot things inside your house? It was just a bunch of junk anyway.
That's how I knew what this place was.
That shed out there, my dad had a place just like this.
You got your Dumpster chair.
That's for sitting in and your drawers all summer drinking.
Got your fancy buckets.
That's for spitting chaw in after your old lady tells you to stop smoking.
You got your internet.
- It's just one of 'em.
- Should we get it? If he keeps making too much noise, yeah.
Well, if we're gonna be trapped again, we might as well make the best of it.
Unless you're too busy chaperoning, Mr.
Dixon.
Hell, might as well make the best of it.
Home, sweet home.
So first I say something I've never done and if you have done it, you drink, and if you haven't, I drink.
Then we switch.
You really don't know this game? I never needed a game to get lit before.
Wait, are we starting? - How do you know this game? - My friends played.
I watched.
Okay, I'll start.
I've never shot a crossbow.
So now you drink.
Ain't much of a game.
That was a warm-up.
Now you go.
I don't know.
Just say the first thing that pops into your head.
I've never been out of Georgia.
Really? Okay, good one.
I've never been drunk and did something I regretted.
I've done a lot of things.
Your turn.
I've never been on vacation.
What about camping? No, that was just something I had to learn to hunt.
Your dad teach you? Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I've never been in jail.
I mean, as a prisoner.
Is that what you think of me? I didn't mean anything serious.
I just thought, you know, like the drunk tank.
Even my dad got locked up for that back in the day.
- Drink up.
- Wait.
Prison guard.
Were you a prison guard before? No.
It's your turn again.
I'm gonna take a piss.
You have to be quiet.
Can't hear you! I'm taking a piss! Daryl, don't talk so loud.
What, are you my chaperone now? Oh, wait.
It's my turn, right? I've never-- never eaten frozen yogurt.
Never had a pet pony.
Never got nothing from Santa Claus.
Never relied on anyone for protection before.
Hell, I don't think I've ever relied on anyone for anything.
- Daryl.
- Never sung out in front of a big group out in public like everything was fun.
Like everything was a big game.
I sure as hell never cut my wrists looking for attention.
Sounds like our friend out there is trying to call all of his buddies.
- Daryl, just shut up.
- Hey, you never shot a crossbow before? I'm gonna teach you right now.
Come on.
It's gonna be fun.
We should stay inside.
Daryl, cut it out! - Daryl! - Dumbass.
Come here, dumbass.
- Daryl.
- You want to shoot? - I don't know how.
- Oh, it's easy.
Come here.
Right corner.
Let's practice later.
- Come on, it's fun.
- Just stop it.
- Daryl! - Come here.
- Eight ball.
- Just kill it! Come here, Greene.
Let's pull these out.
Get a little more target practice.
What the hell you do that for? I was having fun.
No, you were being a jackass.
- If anyone found my dad-- - Don't.
That ain't remotely the same.
Killing them is not supposed to be fun.
What do you want from me, girl, huh? I want to you stop acting like you don't give a crap about anything.
Like nothing we went through matters.
Like none of the people we lost meant anything to you.
It's bullshit! - Is that what you think? - That's what I know.
You don't know nothing.
I know you look at me and you just see another dead girl.
I'm not Michonne.
I'm not Carol.
I'm not Maggie.
I've survived and you don't get it 'cause I'm not like you or them.
But I made it and you don't get to treat me like crap just because you're afraid.
I ain't afraid of nothing.
I remember.
When that little girl came out of the barn after my mom.
You were like me.
And now God forbid you ever let anybody get too close.
Too close, huh? You know all about that.
You lost two boyfriends, you can't even shed a tear.
Your whole family's gone, all you can do is just go out looking for hooch like some dumb college bitch.
Screw you.
You don't get it.
No, you don't get it! - Everyone we know is dead! - You don't know that! Might as well be, 'cause you ain't never gonna see 'em again.
Rick.
You ain't never gonna see Maggie again.
- Daryl, just stop.
- No! The Governor rolled right up to our gates.
Maybe if I wouldn't have stopped looking.
Maybe 'cause I gave up.
That's on me.
- Daryl.
- No-- And your dad.
Maybe-- maybe I could have done something.
I get why my dad stopped drinking.
You feel sick? Nope.
I wish I could feel like this all the time.
That's bad.
Hmm.
You're lucky you're a happy drunk.
Yeah, I'm lucky.
Some people can be real jerks when they drink.
Yeah, I'm a dick when I'm drunk.
Merle had this dealer.
This janky little white guy.
A tweaker.
One day we were over at his house watching TV.
Wasn't even noon yet and we were all wasted.
Merle was high.
We were watching this show and Merle was talking all this dumb stuff about it.
And he wouldn't let up.
Merle never could.
Turns out it was the tweaker's kids' favorite show.
And he never sees his kids, so he felt guilty about it or something.
So he punches Merle in the face.
So I started hitting the tweaker, like, hard.
As hard as I can.
Then he pulls a gun, sticks it right here.
He says, "I'm gonna kill you, bitch.
" So Merle pulls his gun on him.
Everyone's yelling.
I'm yelling.
I thought I was dead.
Over a dumb cartoon about a talking dog.
How'd you get out of it? The tweaker punched me in the gut.
I puked.
They both started laughing and forgot all about it.
You want to know what I was before all this? I was just drifting around with Merle doing whatever he said we were gonna be doing that day.
I was nobody.
Nothing.
Some redneck asshole and an even bigger asshole for a brother.
You miss him, don't you? I miss Maggie.
I miss her bossing me around.
I miss my big brother Shawn.
He was so annoying and overprotective.
And my dad.
I thought-- I hoped he'd just live the rest of his life in peace, you know? I thought Maggie and Glenn would have a baby.
And he'd get to be a grandpa.
And we'd have birthdays and holidays and summer picnics.
And he'd get really old.
And it'd happen, but it'd be quiet.
It'd be okay.
He'd be surrounded by people he loved.
That's how unbelievably stupid I am.
That's how it was supposed to be.
I wish I could just change.
You did.
Not enough.
Not like you.
It's like you were made for how things are now.
I'm just used to it, things being ugly.
Growing up in a place like this.
Well, you got away from it.
- I didn't.
- You did.
Maybe you got to keep on reminding me sometimes.
No.
You can't depend on anybody for anything, right? - I'll be gone someday.
- Stop.
I will.
You're gonna be the last man standing.
You are.
You're gonna miss me so bad when I'm gone, Daryl Dixon.
You ain't a happy drunk at all.
Yeah, I'm happy.
I'm just not blind.
You got to stay who you are, not who you were.
Places like this, you have to put it away.
What if you can't? You have to.
Or it kills you.
Here.
We should go inside.
We should burn it down.
We're gonna need more booze.
there's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet no matter where you live there'll always be a few things maybe several things that you're gonna find really difficult to forgive - You wanna? - Hell, yeah.
there's gonna come a day when you feel better your eyes are free and easy on that day and float from branch to branch lighter than the air just when that day is coming who can say? who can say? our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome but there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim scope out every angle of unfair advantage I'm gonna bribe the officials I'm gonna kill all the judges it's gonna take you people years to recover from all of the damage our mother has been absent ever since we founded Rome but there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home Oh!
