1 GRIMES: We deserve to live in peace.
Negan and the Saviors tried to take that away from us.
Alexandria, the Hilltop, the Kingdom, and the Oceanside came together to fight for a better future.
We won It's not over until he's dead! Not without painful losses.
Today, we try to heal, try to forgive.
Now, the work begins, the new world begins.

JUDITH: It was very drippy before.
MICHONNE: Was it drippy? That's okay.
It's a I'm gonna make it into a heart.
Okay, that's fine.
That's fine.
Go ahead.
It's dripping from the heart.
- It's okay.
- 'Cause the heart's so full.
Is that why? Ah.
Some is dripping on you.
You want to tell me about the painting? - That's our house.
- And Aunt Maggie.
And the King.
All our friends.
Who is that grumpy face? [GLASS CLACKS.]
You get a grumpy, little face.
You doing a grumpy face? He has a happy face, too.
There's going to be his big tummy.
[LAUGHS.]
There's a big tummy.
That's Daddy's big tummy? [BIRDS CHIRPING.]

Daryl.
Hmm? [WALKER GROWLING.]
Hey.
What the hell you doing? Scaring the birds away.
EUGENE: Sanctuary to Alexandria Relay One, come in.
You hear me, AR One? Loud and clear, Ponytail.
What's up? Crops are done-zo at the Sanctuary.
Time to go medieval on this problem's ass, as it were.
Daryl's requesting a run into the city and a backup at the roost.
We meet at the rally point at dawn.
Pass it on.
Over.
JESUS: Copy that.
[GRUNTS.]
[BODY THUDS.]
[GRUNTS.]
[GROWLING STOPS.]
Will you teach me sometime? I got a kids' class at the Hilltop you could audit.
Maggie'll be there.
Carol sometimes shows up when she's in town, so Oh, speaking of [WALKIE TALKIE CLICKS.]

SIDDIQ: [GRUNTING.]
[SCREAMING.]
[GRUNTS.]
You okay? Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
There were spiders.
I-I don't like spiders.
[WALKER GROWLING.]
[WHISTLING.]
Intelligent design.
The De-evolution of man.
- [CHUCKLES.]
- I like it.
[PAPER RUSTLING.]
[OBJECT CLACKS.]
You need help with that? [SNIFFS.]
Uh, yeah.
[SMACKS LIPS.]
Uh, sure.
You all right? I was just, um just thinking about my brother.
We were fighting during a canoe ride at the county fair.
It's funny, you know, how certain things just bring up random memories like that.
[SIGHS.]
Does it happen to you? Most of the memories I got of my brother, we were fighting.
But I had friends that fought with me.
They wanted to be here.
They didn't make it.
So, yeah, it happens to me.
[GRUNTS.]
[BANG ON DOOR.]
[CHAINS RATTLE.]
[DRAWERS RATTLING.]
You were right, Anne.
GABRIEL: How'd you know to find seeds here? Brought my class back when I was teaching.
Found out they cultivated heirloom lines for the gardens, and they kept seeds on hand so they could rotate the crops.
They made a doomsday vault without knowing it.
We're grateful.
The Sanctuary will be, too.
Let's take the lot, get back, see if the others need help.
[PACKAGES RUSTLING.]
So, he called for an election? The one great idea Gregory's had.
Is he still sore about the results? I don't know.
He's being friendly.
It's weird, honestly.
The rebirth of democracy by that guy.
[CHUCKLES.]
Who'd have thought? Meanwhile, I live with a King.
- [LAUGHS.]
- But it works, right? People seem to like it.
But there's something about a vote.
Here we go.
Our blacksmith can use these as a model to make more.
And we can send one to the Sanctuary, try to fix things there.
[SIGHS.]
I'm glad you won your election.
I'm glad I grew up on a farm.
RICK: All right.
Easy.
Last step.
Easy.
[METAL CLINKING.]
All right, hold hold! [METAL CREAKING.]
So far, so good.
[GLASS CREAKS.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[GLASS CREAKING.]
Let's go.
[WAGON THUDDING.]
Easy.
Slow, slow, slow.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa.
Okay.
All right.

- Last step.
- One more.

[HORSE GRUNTS.]
Hey, Ken, Marco here thinks he wants to learn the trade.
Think your dad'll take on another apprentice? I don't see why not.
I can't tell if he likes me.
He's just quiet.
I mean, it comes across as grumpy.
I don't think I've ever seen the guy smile.
All right, it's just, he needs to get to know you first.
Look, I think he'd appreciate the extra help 'cause the Kingdom just sent in this large shipment of scrap metal to melt down.
Hell, shoeing these horses is a full-time job.
If it makes you feel any better, I was pretty sure he hated me, too.
I was scared back there.
I was, too.
[HORSE SNORTS.]
I'm glad you're okay.
[HORSE SNORTS, WHINNIES.]
It made me remember something I've been taking for granted lately.
[HORSE WHINNIES.]
- We can't wait on life, so - Don't.
will you marry me? Put that thing away.
[HORSE SNORTS.]
It'll snag on everything.
- And I told you not to ask me that.
- I know.
Especially after something like this.
And this is not happening on a horse.
[CLICKS TONGUE.]
[LAUGHS.]
I love you.
And I always will.
I'll keep this till you're ready.
[HORSE GRUNTS.]
[ENGINES RUMBLING.]
[ENGINES SHUT OFF.]
ROSITA: Two other herds merged into "Silvia," so now it's even bigger.
One of them came through here, and the back end took down the bridge.
Took the walkie repeater with it.
DARYL: What about Route A? Is that clear yet? It's still too close to the herd.
We can get to Alexandria from this side, stay there till it passes.
No.
Route A has taken days to clear before.
I need to get home to Hershel.
We could take Route D.
It's early enough in the day.
Keep an eye on the trade road in case anyone else tries to move through.
Gabriel, y'all can head back to Alexandria from here.
The rest of us we can go to the Sanctuary or Hilltop, - stay the night, and head off from there.
- [SPRAY CAN HISSING.]
Take care.
Get home safe.
[CAP CLICKS.]
[MUD SQUISHING.]
[HORSE WHINNIES.]
MICHONNE: Rick, the horses can't pull the wagon through this mud.
[HORSES NEIGHING.]
Maggie, I think they need a break.
Maybe we should leave the supplies, send a group back in a day or two.
It's risky.
We've seen herds run through and destroy bigger things than this.
[HORSE GRUNTS.]
We can swap out the horses, split up, take 'em out in the clear, give 'em a rest while we see what we can do about the trailers.
One, two, three.
[ALL GRUNTING.]
[ROPES CREAKING.]
Rick.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
We're almost there.
RICK: One more time.
One, two, three.
[ALL GRUNTING.]
[WAGON CREAKING.]
Good.
Let's get out of here.
Daryl, Michonne.
On it.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[WOOD SCRAPING.]
[HORSE NEIGHS.]
[WALKER GROWLING.]
[HOOVES STOMPING.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
We gotta go.
Leave the wagon! I gotta free her! [GRUNTS.]
Ken, wait! [WALKER GROWLING.]
Aah! [HORSE WHINNYING.]
RICK: [MUFFLED.]
Come on.
[MUFFLED CONVERSATIONS.]
MARCO: They're gonna fix it.
You're gonna be all right.
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not gonna - Yeah.
Look at me.
- You're gonna be all right.
- Come on.
- You'll be okay.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
They're gonna fix it.
You're gonna be all right.
[GASPS.]
- We'll keep the walkers away.
- Okay.
Enid, get the quick clot and a and a tourniquet.
- Here.
- [BREATHING HEAVILY.]
Tell my dad to let Marco take my place, okay? Hey, you're gonna talk to your dad yourself, okay? Just stay awake.
Stay awake.
[GASPS.]
Okay.
MAGGIE: Ken, Ken, just stay awake.
Ken, look at me.
Ken.
Tell my mom and dad I'm I'm comin'.
Ken.
[BIRDS CHIRPING.]
[EXHALING SHARPLY.]
Ken? [SNIFFLES.]
[SNIFFLES, CRIES.]
[FLESH TEARING, SQUISHING.]
[WIND WHISTLING, CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
[CLOCK TICKING.]
Tell me again.
EARL: Tammy.
Tell me again.
Tell me what happened.
Tammy, she's already said everything there is to say.
I don't accept that.
She took our boy out there, and for what? My son is dead, Earl! And what do we have to show for it? Nothing but a broke plow.
Isn't that right? We found more than just a plow.
That run was really important for the future.
Don't you dare talk to me about no future right now.
I know where all that shit went, Maggie.
The Saviors got it, didn't they? He didn't even die helping Hilltop! Tammy, just calm down.
You think I'm gonna hit that little girl? I ain't that woman.
But what kind of man are you just to let this go? [CLOCK TICKING.]
I'm no kind of man at all.
Oh, no, I didn't If you'll let me, I'd like to help arrange a funeral.
Me and Earl will bury our boy, thank you.
And you're not welcome there.
I voted for you, Maggie Rhee, but we're not friends.
I understand.
I really do.
You know, Gregory has been saying he's the one who's always put Hilltop first.
The man's a damn scoundrel but maybe he's no fool.
My son is dead.
Your boy has no father.
And those damn Saviors eat our food and take everything that Hilltop bled for.
It ain't right.
[TICKING CONTINUES.]
ALDEN: 'Tis the last rose of summer Left blooming alone All her lovely companions Are faded and gone No flower of her kindred No rosebud is nigh To reflect back her blushes Or to give sigh for sigh And so soon may I follow When friendships decay And from love's shining circle The gems drop away When true hearts lie withered And fond ones are flown Oh, who would inhabit This bleak world alone? I'm gonna miss you, Ken.
Heaven's a better place for having you.
Cheers.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
MEL: Rick Grimes is here! [ALL MURMURING.]
POTTER: That's the man that ended the war.
Is Negan suffering? I hope he damn well is.
EUGENE: Hello.
All was well in your absence, other than a certain cabal of Saviors slingin' me some serious stink-eye, but I've compiled a list of items that need your semi-immediate attention.
- Not now, man.
- I checked out the supplies.
It's a pretty good haul.
You should let everybody know.
I ain't getting up on a stage and giving a damn speech like him.
It's bad timing.
We just lost someone out there.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
Daryl.
Does this happen often? More and more since the crops been dyin'.
Eugene, Jerry! You know who did that? - Don't know, man.
- That would be a negative.
Justin.
Clean that up.
How? What do you mean, "how"? Paint over it.
We just used up all the paint.
Figure it out.
[SIGHS.]
[CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE.]
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
Ken was a quiet, good-hearted young man.
He wasn't a fighter.
Uh, he he tended to our animals.
He He shoed the horses.
It's regular guys like Ken that keep a place going.
[CRIES.]
He will be remembered as a son, a friend a-a-a shining example of Hilltop's strength and fundamental decency, even in the face of this terrible tragedy.
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
Cheers, Ken.
Rest in peace.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
Gregory.
That was beautiful.
Something like this really makes you think about what you have and what you've lost.
And I'm just I'm just grateful for where I am.
[WOOD CREAKING.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
You see our crops, Rick? RICK: I did.
The spring storms will be here in a few weeks, help us out, but we need a boost in the meantime.
And you'll have it.
We came back with farming tools, heirloom seeds.
We're looking to the past to help us with the present.
We're all gonna pitch in and make sure that Sanctuary has what it needs so you all can get back on your feet.
Bless you, Rick Grimes.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE.]
What's up? [SIGHS.]
I don't wanna be the one leading these people anymore.
Okay.
- Why? - I don't know.
Bein' here behind these walls again It just don't feel right, man.
I'm better out there.
I always have been.
[SIGHS.]
You kept this place together.
You kept people in line here.
We can't just let the Sanctuary fail after everything that's happened.
Man, it's gonna fail anyway.
Nothing grows here.
It's a damn factory, man.
Look, when Negan was around, he needed people to provide for him.
It's still the same.
Nothing's changed.
It's different now.
We give what we give willingly.
How long's that gonna last? Most of the bridges are out after the big storm.
The highway's done.
We've scavenged every drop of gas for miles.
And we can't make enough corn fuel to run the cars or the trucks.
Pretty soon, it's gonna be more than a day's ride from one spot to another.
Well, it's on us to figure out how to make it work.
Man, there ain't no "us" anymore.
Everyone's everywhere.
That small group we had back in the beginning We could do anything.
That was right.
That's what I know.
Well, you wanna come home to Alexandria, then? No.
I'll go back to Hilltop, check on Maggie and the baby.
Well, you go, someone's got to take your place.
Rosita and Eugene are headed to Oceanside next.
Maggie's sending food, but not people, and Kingdom's got its own problems rebuilding after losing its fighters.
If Alexandria sends another person out, I could use the help back home.
Huh.
We're not together because things have changed.
Mm-hmm.
The thing is, you changed them, Rick.
But I get it.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE.]
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
Bless you, but no thank you.
Oh, that's right.
You're sober.
You too? Go ahead, Tammy.
I'm fine.
[BOTTLE CLINKS.]
[CORK POPS.]
GREGORY: [SIGHS.]
[SIGHS.]
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
[MURMURING.]
[SOBBING SOFTLY.]
EARL: I don't know what to do, Tammy.
What am I supposed to do? I just I just want to be by myself.
I just want to sleep.
I can leave.
Don't.
Don't.
[SNIFFLES.]
[VOICE BREAKING.]
I-I just want to sleep.
[WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY.]
[INHALES SHARPLY.]
I'll, uh I-I'll sit with you, if you'd like.
[MATCH STRIKES.]
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
[EXHALES SHARPLY.]
[CIGARETTE THUDS.]
CAROL: Those things'll kill you.
[SIGHS.]
Why aren't you in bed? Why aren't you? [SIGHS.]
We don't sleep.
Ezekiel, on the other hand, sleeps like a baby.
It's annoying.
Does he snore fancy, too? Stop it.
No, he's all right.
He's a bit corny, but Glad I have Pookie's approval.
After what I went through with Ed, corny is really, really nice.
No.
I'm happy for you.
If anybody deserves to be happy, it's you.
I don't like not seein' you, though.
[SIGHS.]
Daryl.
Hmm? I want to take over here for awhile, for you, and don't argue.
You gonna bring Henry and the King with you? I haven't told him yet.
[SIGHS.]
He asked me to marry him.
What? Yeah.
And a part of me wanted to just say "yes" right then.
Why didn't you? I don't know.
I want to help out, take my time, you know? [SIGHS.]
You want me to stay here with you? No.
[SIGHS.]
I'll tell you something else, Gregory.
He didn't need to be out there.
- [CROWBAR THUDS.]
- My son My son didn't need to die.
No, he didn't.
[CORK POPS.]
Where's the justice for my boy? [SIGHS.]
Well, Maggie thinks she's above the law.
[LIQUID POURS, BOTTLE THUDS.]
You know that election? [CUP THUDS.]
It's a joke.
Who do you think counted those ballots? Her buddy Jesus That's who.
Y-You know, I-I've talked to a lot of people, and they're not happy with the way things are going.
Huh.
They're just afraid to speak up.
Maggie will do whatever her pal Rick says, - even if it's not good for Hilltop.
- [LIQUID POURS.]
[BOTTLE THUDS.]
I don't see that we can do a hell of a lot about it, Gregory.
She's the one that decides those things.
Well, it is the decisions she's made and the priorities she set that put your boy into the ground.
I'm speaking plainly because I'm angry.
I'm angry to see the lives at the Hilltop Your son's life being treated like the price of doing someone else's business.
She's the leader.
[BREATHES DEEPLY.]
She doesn't have to be.
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
[BREATHING DEEPLY.]
[EXHALES SHARPLY.]
[SIGHS.]
[SIGHS.]
[SIGHS.]
The famous Rick Grimes.
Oh, god damn it, don't you start, too.
[LAUGHS.]
- [CHUCKLES DRYLY.]
It's sweet.
Just don't let it get to your head.
[CHUCKLES.]
No, not today, that's for sure.
Mm.
Yeah.
I don't envy Maggie right now.
No.
[BOTH SIGH.]
Rick? Hmm? Seeing his name on the wall Did we do the right thing? Sometimes I think maybe we just should have killed him.
Yeah.
I think about it a lot.
But killing him wouldn't have changed anything we saw today.
They don't want Negan.
They want food.
We don't know that, Rick, not for sure.
I've been thinking.
Maybe we need an agreement between all the communities, like, "This is what we believe, this is how we treat each other, and this is what happens when we don't.
" Yeah.
It's good.
It feels like the right time.
We We couldn't before.
We were always running and fighting.
No.
It's smart.
Building up something like that It could pull people closer together.
[SIGHS.]
You know, Daryl's not happy.
He's got me worried about things breaking down.
He wouldn't say something unless it was important.
He cares.
Too much sometimes.
Hey.
If he's worried, there's a reason.
So, what do we do about it? I think we need to fix that bridge.
Okay.
I'll get the people to agree to a charter.
Charter? Not Constitution? - Charter.
- [CHUCKLES.]
Okay.
But tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- Okay? Mm.
Yeah.
[EXHALES SHARPLY.]
[EXHALES SHARPLY.]
[BOTH SIGH.]
How'd I get so lucky finding you? We've both lost enough.
It's time we won a little, don't you think? [SMOOCHES.]
Mm.
- The famous Rick Grimes.
- [LAUGHS.]
Mm.
Mm.
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
GREGORY: Ah.
Tough night? Yeah.
Tough night.
I've been there.
I'm sorry.
I appreciate that.
I know this hasn't been easy for you.
You won the election fair and square, Maggie.
You've been a worthy adversary.
Forced me to do some soul-searching.
It's hard not knowing what your place is.
I'm sure you have one if you want it.
Yeah, well Anyway, I should get my kid to sleep.
Oh, Maggie, I meant to tell you When we were burying Ken before, I didn't want to say anything not now But it looked like someone had defaced Glenn's grave.
Maybe just some sort of accident or kids didn't know any better.
Uh, I hope it wasn't that someone was angry.
Probably no big deal.
Check it out tomorrow.
- Good night.
- Night.
[GRAVEL CRUNCHING.]
[CHIRPING CONTINUES.]
Ugh! [BABY WAILING.]
[BOTH GRUNTING.]
[WAILING CONTINUES.]
Oh, my God, Maggie! [GRUNTS.]
Unh! [WAILING CONTINUES.]
Margaret [STAMMERING.]
My God, Maggie, w-what happened? What happened? You tried to have me killed 'cause you're too chicken-shit to do it yourself.
Margaret, you you need to sit down.
You obviously h-have a head injury.
You want to lead this place? You can't even murder someone right.
This place? I built this place! None of this would exist if it wasn't for me.
You're just Rick's lackey.
Rick ended the war.
That's more than you ever did.
And he's your friend and your mentor.
You know what's funny, is you can't go back to Alexandria because you-know-who is still there.
Do you even give a crap about all of the stupid shit that you have done? After all the chances that you've been given? No.
Because I'm still here.
[GRUNTING.]
They'll all know that you did this.
Earl attacked you because you got his son killed! [SQUEALS.]
[BOTH GRUNT.]
You blamed me.
You attacked me.
And I defended myself.
[GRUNTS.]
GREGORY: [GROANING.]
[GRUNTS.]
[PANTING.]
[BIRDS CAWING.]
CAROL: I'll see you soon.
Give Henry a kiss for me.
[SMOOCHES.]
I'm not running away.
It kind of feels like you are.
If I pushed too hard No.
My friends need my help.
And I want to be there for them.
But I have a home I want to get back to, and that's enough for me for now.
I hope it is for you, too.
I'll be content to move at your speed, Lady Carol.
[GRUNTS.]
Though the waiting is such sweet sorrow.
[SIGHS.]
Jerry, our steeds.
[HORSE SNORTS.]
Jerry, take care of them for me, just for a little bit.
You got it, boss.
[HORSE SNORTS.]
[HOOVES CLOPPING.]

[HORSE SNORTS.]
[GRAVEL CRUNCHING.]
[HORSE SPUTTERS.]
[BIRDS CHIRPING.]
It's funny.
And he knows it.
He's a little stinker.
[CHUCKLES.]
He's just perfect.
He really is.
Yeah.
I think I'll keep him.
Come here.
Okay.
Here you go.
[BABY COOING.]
Don't go running off.
[CHUCKLES.]
Now that Hershel's a little older and you're going on runs again [SIGHS.]
I'd love for you to visit Alexandria sometime, if you're up for it.
Judith talks about Aunt Maggie at Hilltop all the time.
[SIGHS.]
I'm surprised she still remembers you, but she does.
Rick, I can't.
You know I can't.
[SIGHS.]
But you came about something else.
Oh.
Maggie, it can It can wait.
I'm okay.
Just talk to me about anything else, please.
[BIRDS CHIRPING.]
All right.
Well I need your help fixing the bridge.
Hilltop's thriving because of you.
This place is doing better than anywhere else, and you've been generous.
Hilltop's given so much already, but I'm asking for more.
What? Sanctuary's still short on food, and a project like this is gonna take a lot of people and supplies.
I'm asking if you'll be generous again, if you'll stretch.
If my people want to work on the bridge, I won't stop them.
But no more food and supplies without getting something back for it.
What do you want? If the Sanctuary needs food, I'll give it to 'em.
But they provide most of the labor on the bridge for us.
And they send over all the fuel they've been making from their dead corn.
[EXHALES SHARPLY.]
S-Sanctuary's barely holding on right now.
We're obliged to help.
Why? They surrendered.
We didn't kill 'em.
That's it.
I can't solve all their problems when I clearly have things to take care of here.
Maggie, I'm so sorry this happened to you and Enid I've survived worse.
But it has to stop.
[BIRDS CHIRPING.]
When we were fighting the Saviors, you told me that soon, you'd be the one following me.
But you didn't.
'Cause I wasn't someone to follow.
That changes now.
[BABY COOING.]
It'll be dark soon.
It's time to put the children to bed.
[WINDMILL CREAKING, WIND WHISTLING.]
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
[SIGHS.]
I don't want to do this.
But people need to understand that at Hilltop, the punishment fits the crime.
[CHIRPING CONTINUES.]
Do you have any final words? GREGORY: [WHIMPERING.]
What you're doing isn't right.
Somebody stop this, please.
Killing me in the dead of night because you're ashamed.
You're wrong.
I'm not ashamed.
Stop this! Please! Now, for the love of God, stop it! [BREATHING RAGGEDLY.]
- Maggie, stop! - Wait! - [WHIP CRACKS, HORSE WHINNIES.]
- DARYL: Ha! [NECK CRACKS, GASPING.]
[ROPE CREAKING, HOOVES CLOPPING.]
Get the children back in bed.
I made this decision.
But this is not the beginning of something.
I don't want to go through it again.
[CREAKING CONTINUES.]
[CRICKETS CHIRPING.]
Cut him down.
[KNIFE SCRATCHING.]
- [ROPE CREAKS, SNAPS.]
- [BODY THUDS.]
