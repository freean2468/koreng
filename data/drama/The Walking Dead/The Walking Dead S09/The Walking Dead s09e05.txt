Previously on "The Walking Dead" It's time to see Negan.
You know what keeping Negan alive means to us.
I know what seeing him dead means to her.
Please, you don't have to do this.
I forgive you, Anne.
Take 'em to the bridge.
It ain't ever gon' hold 'em.
- They'll get washed out to sea.
- No, man.
I'm not sacrificing the bridge.
I'll find another way.
Damn it! Wake up.
Wake up.
It's time to go.
Wake up.
What is your wound? Wake up.
Yeah, wake up, asshole.
Aah, aah! Jadis, confirm location.
Confirm location and status of your "A.
" I'm in a clearing.
East bank of the Accotink.
1.
6 miles due north of the junkyard.
You have the "A"? I have the "A," and it's ready for transport.
We hadn't heard from you since the aborted pickup.
We know your group vacated the landfill.
If this is a trick, there can still be consequences.
It's not a trick.
If I need evacuation, you know that I'm desperate.
I need to leave this place.
You know where to find me.
And I'll be ready.
I need to keep 'em safe.
I need to stay awake.
Lead 'em away.
Some Easy.
Whoa.
Gimme a minute.
We can go now.
Hey! Hey! Easy.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.
I'm looking for my family.
What's your wound? God damn, cowboy.
Look like shit.
So, what is this? What is this? Come on, Rick.
Look around.
You know what this is.
Are those the idiots we were chasin'? Attaboy.
Dispatch said there was two suspects, right? Oh, there's a third man.
Yes, there was.
That third man changed everything, didn't he? I'm looking for my family.
Oh, is that what you're doing, looking for your family, huh? Mm-hmm.
Well, see, that's not entirely true.
One could argue it's my family you're lookin' for, right? How is my baby girl, by the way? Got my eyes, doesn't she? Mm.
She hasn't got your nose.
Good thing she ain't got my ears, man.
Ah, you're You're such an asshole.
Oh, yes, I am, yes, I am.
- I am the asshole.
- Hm.
Same as you, really.
Oh, you think I'm an asshole? I don't think a thing, man.
I know you're an asshole.
I like to take credit for that, actually, Rick, when I think about it.
I mean, I'm sure others did influence you, but I'd like to take full credit.
I didn't want it.
You know that.
But you took it, right? Boy, that shit you did in that field, just you and me, man, you took a page out of my book, Rick.
You know, I'm glad you did it.
You stepped up, brother.
It had to be me.
Still has to be me.
Yeah, see, Rick, yeah, I think that's where you're wrong.
Has to be me.
- You? - That's right.
The only way this gets done, Rick.
I want you to think about how you bit that piece of shit's throat out.
Asshole in the church with the red machete.
That is what I'm talkin' 'bout.
That's the shit that I need from you that I always knew you had in you.
I knew you had it in you, Rick, and it is time.
You want answers? You wanna know what this is all about, - this right here, you and me? - I asked you, didn't I? Yeah, you did ask, so now I'm gonna tell ya, and I want you to listen carefully.
- You got it? - Mm.
It's time.
Kneel down.
Dig deep.
Find it, Rick The rage, the hatred.
Find it.
The loyalty that's in there, find it.
It's in there, Rick.
It's the only way that this gets done, and this has to get done.
You understand me? It has to.
You can do it, brother.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for what I did to you.
You need to forget that shit.
You know somethin', Rick? Wake up! What are you makin'? A bracelet.
- Oh, with the shells? - Mm-hmm.
That's gonna be pretty.
A creature used to live in this one? Yeah, all of them.
- This one? - Yep.
Hey.
Hope I'm not No, no.
Come on in.
What's goin' on? Maggie's here.
Aunt Maggie.
One of the guys at the gate told me she just came in.
What? Maggie? Get out of my way.
You're willing to turn this into something else? For him? Not for him, for me.
For others.
For Glenn.
Negan should've died under that tree.
But he didn't die, Maggie.
It's done.
Because Rick decided it was? Step back.
You were there, Michonne.
You saw what Negan did.
You think Glenn would want this? For you to go through me to get to him? I dunno what he'd want.
I dunno, because I never got to say goodbye.
He wouldn't want it, Maggie.
Your father wouldn't want this.
You know this.
The only thing I had, the one thing I had was knowing I was gonna see Glenn's murderer die, and you took it from me.
So takin' it back, what the hell is that gonna do? - It's gonna start things over.
- No.
It's gonna start something else.
If he'd butchered Rick in front of you instead of Glenn Mm, Maggie.
If you had a child to raise alone because of him, he would've been dead a long time ago, and you know it.
So stop actin' like this is a choice.
Stop actin' like I can just turn it off.
Because it has been a year and a half, and I can't.
You're gonna have to find a way.
Tell me how.
If there is something else that I can do, Michonne.
Because I can't keep livin' like this.
I I can't.
I can't.
'Cause there's nothin' you can say.
There's only what you do.
And you can live with what comes after? Have to.
Can't live with it now.
Aw, she just gave up the keys, huh? It's a shame.
She got the blade, but you You got the fire.
My money was on you.
So you remember me.
'Course I do.
It's why I thought you were gonna win.
Good.
Get on your knees.
You know, I remember you screamin' in that clearing.
I remember how much I broke you breakin' open your husband's head like I did.
Glenn.
His name was Glenn.
So now what? You finally come for revenge? - Justice.
- Damn.
Thought you'd do this a hell of a lot sooner.
It take you this long to work up your nerve? I was always gonna settle this, what you did to my husband.
Get on your knees.
What I did to him? You mean how I cracked open his skull and popped out his goddamn eyeball? How I bashed his big, beautiful brains into the ground over and over while you and his little friends watched? Is that what you mean? Ah, I used to say that I didn't enjoy killin'.
That was a lie.
Your old man Christ, I forgot his name again.
But he was different.
Killin' him the way I did, ooh, now, that was fun.
Get to it.
Have your justice.
Kill me.
It was worth it.
Lemme see you in the light.
Come on.
Kill me.
You not have it in you? Don't you punk out like Rick.
Come into the light.
Kill me.
This is what you came here for! You kill me! Move into the light.
Kill me.
Please.
Please.
Please kill me.
- Why? - You have to.
- Just do it.
- You tell me why! Tell me! Why should I?! So I can be with my wife! So I can be with Lucille! I should be dead.
I have to be dead.
And it's supposed to be you.
It has to be you, because I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I've tried.
I can't.
I can't be like this.
Please, please don't make me stay like this.
It's Settle it.
Settle me.
Kill me.
Please.
Get back in your cell.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Why? I came to kill Negan, and you're already worse than dead.
That settles it.
Go.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
Maggie, Michonne, somethin's up at the camp.
I need to lead 'em.
Gotta find my family.
What's your wound? Hey, Rick.
Here.
Look at this.
This place.
It's beautiful.
It is something, isn't it? I'm so sorry for what happened to you.
To Beth and Glenn.
For everything Maggie's lost.
Rick.
Maybe if I tried harder, done things different, listened more My girl, she's strong, and my grandson, he'll only make her stronger.
You ain't gotta worry about her.
I need to find my family.
I need to keep 'em together.
No, you don't.
You only think you do.
I know it's been hard.
It has.
What you wanted for me, for Carl, it hasn't been easy.
- We've been tryin' - But we'll get there.
All of us.
I'm tired, Hershel.
My family Maybe I can find 'em here.
No, Rick.
You have to wake up.
What's your wound? They They're all dead.
Yeah.
I know.
And it's okay.
How can it be okay? How How can this be okay? 'Cause you did your part, like I did mine, like the others did before us.
How? They give us the strength that we needed to do what we had to do for the others, and the others draw strength from us.
We change each other.
We help each other.
We make each other better.
And it never ends.
It feels like it's ending.
Little things do end, but it's never the end of everything, because we don't die.
It's not about you or me or any one of us.
It's about all of us.
And I don't think it just evens out.
I think it always crosses over toward the good, toward the brave, toward love.
Your family You're not gonna find them, because they're not lost.
And you are not lost.
What you need to do is wake up.
No.
No.
Rick.

- I can't.
- You will.
I can't.
You will.
It's not over.
We don't die.
You wanna know why I fell in love with you? Because you're a fighter, and you never give up.
So fight, Rick.
