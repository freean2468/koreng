Previously on "The Walking Dead" This isn't the way back to Hilltop.
We ain't going back to Hilltop.
Putting ourselves out there when we don't have to is dangerous! So is cutting us off from the rest of the world.
I went there to see Negan.
I feel sorry for him.
I don't want you to ever go near him again.
Why not? People don't really change.
You did.
He ain't out here.
I followed this to the ocean and back.
Nothing out there, either.
You good? This one's been kicking the shit out of me every morning at 4:00.
Can't sleep, anyways.
Judith's been asking about you.
It's been a while since we've seen you back at Alexandria.
I'll be back when I find something.
Plenty of reasons to come back.
Finding something doesn't have to be one of them.
Looks like I'm gonna be the only one out here for a while.
You don't need to do that.
Ain't gonna stop looking.
Not ever.
You okay being alone? You? I'm not.
Judith, stay with your brother.
What is it? Daryl's at the gate.
And you didn't let him in? He's not alone.
Henry's hurt.
You were closest.
I wouldn't have come.
We had no other choice.
What about her? She's with us.
We can't trust her.
But I trust Daryl.
Open it! Found them wandering not far from here.
One of them's hurt.
Oh, my God Michonne? Jocelyn? It's okay.
It's okay.
So, where to now? Straight to the Kingdom? Well, probably not straight, but, yeah Carol should know.
Keep an eye on the girl.
I'm on it.
Doesn't look like they were followed.
Daryl covered his tracks.
If those skin jobs are looking they'll find us soon enough.
And them.
Jocelyn.
Jocelyn! You've lost too much blood! Michonne! Hey, hey.
- Joss, what are you doing? - I have to go back.
- No, there's no way she can travel right now.
- I have to.
There are others.
- What others? - Whoa! - Oh, hey, hey, hey.
- You cannot go out there like this.
- I have to find them.
- Find who? - Joss, wait! - No, you don't get it! Hey.
Hey.
It's me.
It's me.
Talk to me.
Tell me what you need.
Mich, I need help.
You sure about this one? Yeah.
This is one of the places Joss hid us.
I'm pretty sure some of 'em would come back here.
Well, if we want in, looks like we got to go aro Crafty maneuver.
Points for dexterity.
Does your compadre plan on moseying her way 'round again? Uh yeah.
She'll mosey.
Well It's gross.
And it's gonna leave a huge scar.
I like it.
You'll never forget what you did.
Neither will I.
Henry, I need to speak to Lydia.
Alone.
It's okay.
You stay.
No, really, I'll go.
I got to move around and make sure these stitches hold anyways.
I heard you let people go to the fair.
I want to say thank you.
The Kingdom needs this.
If I'd known all this, I wouldn't have.
You care about him.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Sit.
I've done things to protect this place.
Some things, I'm not proud of.
Some, I try to forget.
To save my people, I've I've had to risk others.
It hasn't been easy, but it's what I had to do.
And I've made my peace with that.
Might be easier if the only life I had to risk was my own.
If I could just walk away and take all the risk with me if that somehow could make everyone else safe that wouldn't be so hard.
Think about that.
Is Hilltop in danger? I don't know.
Might be.
But you helped Lydia, anyways.
No, I went to get Henry.
Lydia just kind of tagged along.
You brought her here.
That means you want to help.
I want to help, too.
I know you do.
Would you stay if my mom says it's okay? Nah.
I should keep movin'.
Your mom's right.
Keeping you and RJ safe.
This place.
That's That's what's important.
No, it isn't.
I mean, not just us.
I've heard the stories, how everyone fought the Saviors and won.
We can do that again.
You haven't heard all the stories.
What would my dad do? Yeah, that's what I thought.
Okay.
Who wants to play the quiet game? I do! Shh.
He lost! He lost! He couldn't do it! Hey, at least he lasted longer this time, Marcus.
All right, who wants to play the quiet game again? Me! I didn't realize how much we all needed this until now.
I wish he could see this.
He can.
Wherever he is, I'm sure he knows.
Oh, Michonne, I'm sorry.
- That's not what I meant.
- It's okay.
Excuse me.
Man.
When you said your kids could hunt, I thought maybe a couple squirrels and a slingshot, tops.
Linus and Winnie did good today.
They always do.
I don't know how you do it.
All those kids? I would go nuts.
They take care of me.
None of the adults in our group made it.
They just broke.
But children They grow.
They learn.
They're capable of anything.
You brought all my kids back to me, and now you're back at it? Don't even.
I know the look.
You're going out for your man.
There is no look.
Woman, please.
- Junior year.
- Oh, God.
Dean Turner said he needed a thousand signatures before he'd consider your petition, and the look you gave him when you showed up at his fancy ass Regent's dinner with double that That look.
That man was an asshole.
Told you.
The look.
You already know you're going.
So at least you can enjoy this.
What if I never find him? You might not.
But if you give up now, then you definitely never will.
And you can't live with that, can you? I need to know.
Judith this baby, they deserve to know.
So go find him, Mich.
You found me after 15 years.
Last time I saw you, there was still a world.
It can't feel more impossible than that.
I am so glad that you are here.
So am I.
Remember way back when I told you you'd make a great father? You got to skip the exploding diapers part, but I was right.
A lot's changed.
Back then, we were still building bridges.
Stay safe.
Yeah, you too.
Thank you.
She's mad at me.
It's 'cause she don't know.
Why don't you tell her? She's not ready.
Neither am I.
She's a kid.
She gets to keep being one as long as I can help it.
That's not just a little kid you got there.
Dog! - Another sleepover? - Yeah Judith loves them.
Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
I'm good.
How are you? - Good.
Hello? Joss? Judith? Marcus? Marcus! Where you at, buddy? Judith! Michonne! - Oh, my God.
- Something's wrong.
The infirmary was raided.
No No.
No, no, no, no Joss, no Can I have more tomatoes, please? Of course you can, baby.
There you go.
Judith.
Eat, don't poke.
Sorry, Mom.
I'm not that hungry.
I had a snack before, so Is it okay if I go to my room? Sure.
Just wrap your food and put it away first, okay? I will.
Thanks, Mom.
Judith? Listen I know you're upset.
I'd like to talk.
There's something I-I want to tell you.
Has Judith been down here today? You just curious, or Answer the damn question.
I haven't seen her.
Not since yesterday.
What the hell does she talk to you about, anyway? So now you're curious.
For someone who wants to be helpful, you're doing a pretty shit job of it.
Nothing, really.
- Um, just chit-chat.
- Specifics.
Homework, sometimes.
Other times, how much she misses her Uncle Daryl.
She likes hearing stories about her dad.
- And Carl.
- So you feed her bullshit.
She'd smoke out the bullshit, you know that.
I let her know that she's just as much a badass as Carl was.
How he got into the Sanctuary and shot up a bunch of my men.
How dear ol' dad ninja-sliced my jugular.
They're all old stories, Michonne, - but they are new to her.
- Mm.
And you tell her these things why? Because you know that I haven't? Or because you're trying to earn some sort of trust with her? Something that you can use? - She likes listening to me talk.
- You like hearing yourself talk.
So we have that in common.
The point is, she comes down here to talk to me because I shoot straight with her.
And now, maybe if you did that, you'd be talking to her right now instead of me.
You shoot straight? Really? Did you tell her what you did to Glenn? To Abraham? Yeah, I didn't think so.
I've always been honest with her.
She asks questions, and I answer them.
So, yeah, she's heard those stories, too.
This some She hates that you're not letting new people in.
She thinks that things should be like Carl thought they should be in the letter that he wrote to her.
No, you don't get to talk to me about Carl.
And you definitely don't get to tell me what she wants or feels! She is my daughter! That is exactly right.
She is your daughter, so she has her own ideas about how things should be.
Oh, you didn't come down here because you're curious.
You came down here because you have no idea where she is.
Maybe she's off petting a horse.
Or maybe she is exactly like her mother, and she is not taking shit lying down.
Let's take a break.
I know you wanna be out here.
But you got a baby, you know? We'll find her.
We will.
I can't believe this.
She was a friend, you know? Like, a real one.
We went through everything together Figuring out who we were gonna be.
Heartbreak Losing my mom I wanted her to be that again, you know? I needed it.
I let my guard down, and now Hey.
This ain't on you.
Not even a little.
I should've known, Daryl.
I should've sensed something.
You didn't 'cause you ain't like her.
Some people just got so much evil in their hearts, and they hide it, like they're wearing a mask or something.
Nah.
This is on her, and she'll pay.
We'll find 'em.
We will.
We should keep moving.
PJ! Wait! Wait! Michonne? Where are my kids? Drop 'em.
Just tell me that they're safe.
Ohh! - Ohh! - Okay.
I said.
Drop it.
Okay.
Okay.
Aah! Nice, Linus, nice.
She's awake.
Go on, Linus.
Be strong.
Well done, Linus.
The strong survive.
And thrive.
I told you, children are capable of anything.
I taught them, helped them become what we are.
Because they can't be soft.
Not now.
Not like I was Where is she?! Control it, Winnie.
Don't let it control you.
Judith! Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Aah.
Hey.
We should split up.
All right.
I'm gonna tie him up.
Okay.
Send out another patrol.
There could be more of them.
They're both out.
Alert the others.
Load up the rest.
We need to go.
Where are my kids? Where's Judith? - Tell me! - Why? She's better off.
You live in the past, chasing a ghost, while Judith's been with me.
Judith! Judith! Come on! You know what's next, Linus.
Marked our kill, kill our mark.
Help him.
Let's go.
I don't want to have to hurt you.
Ohh! No! Judith! Ohh! Ohh! Judith! Back off! I didn't know it was going to be you, Michonne.
I'm truly sorry that it is.
It was just fate.
You can all come back to Alexandria.
We'll take care of you now.
Kill all of her children.
The rest of you are with me.
Winnie! No! No! No! Stop it! Please! Please! No! Stop! - Go, finish it! - Winnie! No! Please! Stop! Please! No! Winnie! Winnie please don't.
Judith Judith Mommy! Hi.
You okay? Oh.
Are you okay? Hi, guys.
Hi.
Judith! Mommy, help! - Mommy, help! - No! Mommy! No! - You okay? - Yeah.
We need to talk.
I was standing right there, and it was like you didn't know me.
For a second, I thought I thought I was too late.
I thought that you'd changed and that I'd lost you.
You didn't look like you.
Because of the blood.
But then I saw it was.
And I was happy you'd found me.
You remember that? What else? Jocelyn.
Her kids.
They were nice to us the whole time.
I remember they made it all seem like a game, so we went with them.
But she was a bad person.
They all were.
It's why you did what you did.
All this time, I thought you didn't remember.
I hoped you didn't.
And you You never said anything after that first year.
Because it made you sad.
What I've done at home I thought you didn't understand because you didn't know.
But you did.
So how the hell are we here right now? Our friends need our help.
Oh, Judith, it's not that simple.
Yes, it is.
You're my mom.
You chose to be.
Because you love me, and I love you.
I do.
And loving someone means doing whatever it takes to keep them safe, right? But when did we stop loving Daryl? Aunt Maggie? Carol? The King? We We didn't.
Then why does it feel that way? Mommy! Your father and I dug this together.
And that day, standing right here, I made a promise to never bury another child again.
But then your father was gone and I was lost.
And then you were lost.
And I was scared.
More scared than I have ever been before, or since.
And I wasn't the only one.
So we decided to make this place only about the people who lived here.
And that's not what Carl or your dad gave their lives to create, but it kept you and RJ safe.
That's what I wanted.
That is all I wanted.
You were right.
We have to protect the people we love.
All the people we love.
And we will.
Do you think it'll leave a scar? No.
But it's okay if it does.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Anyone headed to Kingdom? We must tell Alpha.
