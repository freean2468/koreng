1 Previously on "The Walking Dead" I'm not letting my men take five armed strangers into Hilltop.
I say we take our chances out there.
[CRYING.]
I should be dead.
Please kill me.
He's taken a stubborn interest in blacksmithing.
Oh.
We might be able to help with that.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
WALKER: Don't let them get away.
We found Rosita outside the walls yesterday.
And, uh, Eugene's missing.
We're headed out to go find him.
[GROWLING.]
It's about 130, 140 of them.
You ever see them do this before? No.
Never.
Rosita's back trail goes right through 'em.
We should get the horses, circle around, then we'll pick it up on foot.
- What about them? - What about 'em? They're just milling around.
That's not normal.
No.
No, it ain't.
[WIND RUSHING.]
We should go.
There's a storm coming.
Dog! [DOG BARKS, PANTING.]
[GROWLING.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS, HOOFBEATS.]
GABRIEL: You are here.
Aware of yourself.
Can't get me! Just let it go.
Better watch out! Hey, wait for me! - Don't judge the distraction.
- There it is! Accept it, consider it, and then release it.
Just let it wash over you.
It's all right You know what? Screw it.
Screw it.
My mind never "empties," anyway.
Generally goes straight to that place that would blush the collar right off of you.
[SIGHS.]
Although, now that you and Rosita are a thing, maybe I'm wrong.
- I mean - [BALL BOUNCING.]
hot damn.
I want to understand why you do this.
You clearly want help.
I can see you trying.
Yeah.
[CHUCKLES.]
Maybe we cooked it up, chewed it up, and shat it out already.
Maybe this is all we get.
You don't feel like you're getting any benefit to our sessions? Well, I am reminded that another week has passed, but other than that? [BALL BOUNCING.]
- [SIGHS.]
- [CHUCKLES.]
Ah, don't take it personally, Gabe.
I know I'm never getting out of here.
I do appreciate you coming down here and helping me when that was touch and go for me.
But now I got everything I need.
This little window right here It's as good as a TV.
And I loved the shit outta TV back when that was a thing.
Acceptance is an important first step.
But a life needs to have meaning.
Funny thing about this window here.
People stand out there, and they talk.
And it's like they don't remember I'm here.
And that Well, that is when I get the really good shit.
[BALL BOUNCING.]
You know, just the other day, Rosita was out there chatting up a storm.
She said some things that you would find very interesting.
[BALL BOUNCING.]
I don't need you to tell me how Rosita feels about me.
Now, who said she was talking about you? [BALL BOUNCING.]
We'll try this again next week.
It's your world, boss.
[BALL BOUNCING.]
[DOOR CREAKS.]
[DOOR CLOSES.]
[SIGHS, CHUCKLES.]
[HORSE WHINNIES.]
[HOOFBEATS.]
Who are those men? Messengers.
Came all the way from Hilltop.
They found Rosita.
She's hurt.
Riders! Riders are coming! - Go, quick! - Riders are coming! Riders! - Riders are coming! - Oh! Riders are coming! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING.]
Hey.
You guys seeing this? How many? Six.
No, wait Be ready.
Be patient.
If it were me, I'd have you up on that wall ready to shoot an arrow at anyone I didn't like the looks of.
What's not to like about us? We're a solid-looking group.
We're scrappy.
State your business.
We're here for Rosita.
We met your messengers on the road.
They told us what happened.
And the others? They're good people looking for a home.
I told them Hilltop would consider taking them in.
[BIRDS CHIRPING.]
[HORSE SNORTS LIGHTLY.]
[HORSE WHINNIES.]
[CLEARS THROAT.]
[THUD.]
[THUD.]
Just got these back.
[THUD.]
[FOOTSTEPS.]
MICHONNE: Where's Jesus? Out with the search party looking for Eugene.
Eugene's missing? Since when? I dunno.
Thought you would.
He went out with Rosita, but wasn't with her when we found her.
How is she? She was unconscious when she got here, but she'll be fine.
It's dehydration and heat exhaustion, mainly.
She should wake up soon.
If she's been out the entire time, how do you know Eugene was with her? - Aaron told us.
- Aaron's here? No, he's with Jesus and Daryl.
Daryl came down from his mountain with Carol and Henry.
It's like the old gang's back together.
Which way were they headed? ALDEN: You can pick up their trail, but you're not gonna catch them before nightfall.
TARA: It's Daryl.
Probably on their way back already.
You can have your weapons back when you leave tomorrow.
As for the rest of you, you're gonna have to wait until Jesus gets back.
And if you want to stay, stay, I'm gonna have to talk to him.
And you're gonna have to earn your keep.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.]
She says, "Thank you.
" We all do.
Okay.
It's good we're here.
Yeah [GATE CREAKS.]
[GATE CLOSES.]
So, the guy running things here calls himself "Jesus"? Sounds like a cult to me.
Well, let's assume that [CHUCKLING.]
it is.
If we plan on staying awhile, we should be thinking about how to prove our worth.
MICHONNE: So, what else don't I know? I didn't know anything about Eugene and Rosita But you knew Aaron was working a backchannel Hilltop is not a backchannel, Michonne.
We're talking about our friends here.
Hi, Carol.
Siddiq.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I didn't expect to see you here.
Same.
Who are your friends? - We're not friends yet.
- I'm Magna.
This is Yumiko and Connie.
- Sorry.
That's all I know.
- [CHUCKLES.]
It's nice to meet you, too.
Come on, let's figure out where they're putting us up.
- How's - Is You first.
How's Judith and RJ? Good.
Really good.
RJ's gonna be as tall as Judith any minute now.
Is Ezekiel here, too? No.
Just me.
I'm dropping off Henry.
He's gonna be apprenticing with the blacksmith.
- Good for him.
- Mm-hmm.
He's a good kid.
He's got a big heart.
And he sees his home falling apart, and he wants to help out.
I read Ezekiel's letter.
And I'm sorry for your troubles.
You can still help.
We really need this fair.
If Alexandria could just send a delegation I'm sorry.
I am.
I didn't want to turn you down.
You of all people.
But we've had our troubles, too.
You know that.
I know what you went through.
And I get why this is hard for you.
But we've all lost something.
You and me, we both lost children.
And we kept going.
For each other.
We've always been a family.
And we still are.
But Kingdom is Kingdom, Hilltop is here, and Alexandria is there, and in between, there's a whole lot of broken world, and we cannot pretend otherwise.
We've got to take care of our own now.
It's just the way it is.
That's a shame.
It is.
It was good to see you.
Give Ezekiel and Henry my best.
AARON: Daryl says he's been trading with Hilltop again.
JESUS: He used to come like clockwork a couple times a year.
Never stayed, though.
The gaps between the trips got longer and longer.
Prefers it out here, I suppose.
Sounds like somebody else I know.
[CHUCKLES.]
We used to be explorers.
The whole world was ours to rediscover.
Well, we were out looking for people.
Offering them a chance to be a part of something bigger.
Because of you, we were able to find each other.
Maybe showing those people a way forward is the next step in that.
- I just don't think that I'm - I do.
I think you'd be a damn good leader if you'd just stop fighting it.
You think that's what I'm doing? He's spent a long time keeping people away, but finding them it's kind of his thing.
Stay.
Maybe one day, he'll stop fighting it, too.
[WIND RUSHING.]
[GROWLING IN DISTANCE.]
The herd It's coming for us.
The wind is carrying the sound.
[WIND WHISTLING.]
[GRUNTS.]
C'mon.
Let's put some ground between us and them.
Yeah.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
Carol.
Mind if I hitch a ride? Back to Kingdom? I talked to Tara.
The Kingdom needs me now more than Hilltop does.
I'd like the company.
[HORSE SNORTS LIGHTLY.]
[BOX THUDS.]
[BOX THUDS.]
I talked Mr.
Sutton into an advance on my pay.
Got us some nails and screws for you to take home.
[HORSE WHINNIES.]
You didn't have to do that.
We'll take good care of him.
It's all right.
I wouldn't be leaving if I didn't trust him.
Keep out of trouble, kiddo.
Hey.
I'll be back for the fair, okay? Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna make you proud.
[VOICE BREAKING.]
You already have.
[BREATHES SHARPLY.]
[WOOD CREAKING.]
[HORSE WHINNIES.]
[HOOFBEATS.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
You put that herd around 140, right? Yeah.
Looks like more than double that now.
Could be a different herd.
Or it merged with another one.
Ain't gonna be there very long.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
Don't matter how big it is as long as it's going the other way.
Come on.
[SMOOCHES.]
[RINGING CONTINUES.]
[METAL CLANGING.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
Hey, Henry.
How's the first day going? It's good.
Good.
Yeah, um, Alden is showing me how to make a spearhead.
He's picking it up fast.
Well, of course he is.
Maybe we should keep him and send you back to the Kingdom.
[CHUCKLES.]
You got a sec? Yeah, sure.
Be right back.
[CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE.]
You got plans after dinner? Huh? After dinner.
Thought you might like to come over and spend the evening with Tammy and me.
Oh, I was gonna see if Enid wanted to Um.
Yeah, I mean, yeah, sure, Mr.
Sutton.
NEGAN: You know, I read something fascinating the other day.
You know what a smell is? It's when odor molecules activate neurons in your nasal passages.
So every time you come in here to change my bedpan and smell my shit, something that was actually in my ass goes right up your nose.
Shut up.
I'm sorry.
I never know exactly which eye I'm supposed to look at.
It's a little bit distracting.
Just.
Shut.
Up.
For once in your life, shut your damn mouth.
I keep scratching at you.
I keep trying to figure out what's underneath it all, 'cause I think, if I dig deep enough, I'll find a person.
Someone I can help.
But I never do.
All I find is more What happened? Rosita's at Hilltop.
I sent her out, and she got hurt.
The messenger doesn't know what happened or how bad it is.
And I can't go to help her because I have to be here with you.
Because somebody has to stay behind to be responsible for you.
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't know.
Don't.
It's bad enough I got to clean up your shit, I shouldn't have to listen to it, too.
[GATE CREAKS, SLAMS.]
[DOOR OPENS.]
[DOOR SLAMS.]
[HANDCUFFS CLICK.]
[SIGHS LIGHTLY.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS, LAUGHTER.]
GAGE: Hey, Huckleberry! We gotta cheer you up, man, you're depressing the hell out of us.
[DISHES CLATTER.]
Hey, I'm Gage.
Henry.
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember.
You were here during the war.
The kid with the stick.
Yeah, yeah, that was, uh, me.
Sorry, it was just a long time ago.
Oh, you're You're Abby, right? Addy.
With a "D.
" - It's short for "Adeline.
" - And this is Rodney.
RODNEY: With an "R.
" - [LAUGHS.]
- Shut up.
Yeah.
So, we've been watching you mope around down there.
Addy here's seriously worried about you.
I never said Are you all right? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm just, uh New place.
Getting used to everything.
You know.
GAGE: I don't, actually.
I've lived here more than half my life.
ADDY: Same here.
How's that for sad? At least you get to go someplace new.
RODNEY: Have you ever been to Oceanside? Is it really all women? Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Damn.
I should become a fisherman.
[LAUGHTER.]
Hey, you should hang out with us tonight.
Yeah, we've got a place in the woods.
We could show you what passes for fun around here.
Out in the woods? Don't they shut the gates down at sundown? [SCOFFS.]
You're telling me you've never snuck out of Kingdom? Dude, come on.
Look, whatever's got you down, it's not worth it, all right? You just got to keep moving forward.
Life's too short.
[SIGHS.]
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Let's do it.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE.]
I'm I'm sorry we kept so much from you.
But you know that I'm on your side.
It's not Coming here I knew people would still be angry, but that doesn't make it any easier.
No.
No, but it's not too late to go mend some of those fences.
No, it's not.
But I won't.
Not the way they want me to.
I didn't make the choices I made because I thought they'd be easy.
At least they're alive so they can hate me for it.
ROSITA: Michonne? - Hey.
- Hey, just rest.
- You're okay.
- Where am I? You're at Hilltop.
Jesus and Aaron found you.
How long have I been here? Hey, just a little over a day.
But you got to take it easy now.
No.
Eugene he's still out there.
We We know.
We know.
There's a group out there tracking him right now.
- They're already out there? - Yeah.
Daryl took Jesus and Aaron this morning.
They should be back any minute.
- No, we have to help them.
- W-W-W-Wait.
I know where he is.
I'm gonna take you to him.
Rosita, stop.
Okay? Whatever's going on, they can handle it.
No, they can't.
They have no idea what they're dealing with.
[THUNDER RUMBLING.]
[WIND RUSHING.]
[DOG PANTING.]
[RUMBLING CONTINUES.]
Go on, boy.
Go find him.
[DOG PANTING.]
[DOG WHINING.]
Move.
Good dog.
Hey.
JESUS: Here.
AARON: Eugene? Are you in there? [BREATHING HEAVILY.]
EUGENE: Affirmative.
Hey.
[BREATHING QUICKLY.]
Give me your hand.
[GRUNTING.]
[PANTING.]
Eugene, Eugene.
you all right? I took a bad step and dislocated my knee.
There was a herd on our six, and Rosita was forced to stash me here.
Well, if it's dislocated, - we can just pop it back in - No.
We have to get out of here.
The herd that followed us here is on its way back.
DARYL: I saw their tracks.
They're gone.
No, it's not.
It's already been through here twice.
It's looking for me.
We have to get away before it comes back.
[BREATHING SHAKILY.]
This wasn't a normal herd.
What do you mean? When When they passed us by, we could hear them.
They were [BREATHING SHAKILY.]
They were whispering to each other.
[BREATHING SHAKILY.]
You mean they were talking? I-I know how it sounds.
But Rosita heard it, too.
She'll corroborate.
- Yeah.
- We should get him back.
Yeah.
[DOG BARKS.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
There's no way that's the same herd.
They got us cut off.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
[GRUNTS.]
So we'll backtrack, we'll go around 'em.
Old Route 28 isn't far.
It's the straightest shot back to the horses.
- [GRUNTING.]
- Lead the way.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION, LAUGHTER.]
GAGE: Yeah? Do it, do it, do it.
Come on.
ADDY: You need another white lighting? Shut up, I'm gonna I'm gonna get it.
- [LAUGHS.]
- For showing me the way to be - [LAUGHTER.]
- Oh, good game, champ.
I'd like to see you do better.
'Cause when my soul got weak Hey, last laughs.
We have enough love, so maybe we won't have to borrow Yeah, I-I-I can't.
Come on, ride the lighting! It's last laughs! - Ooh, yeah - [LAUGHTER.]
- All right - Ohh.
- Wow, guys.
- I wanna love you, baby If this is your idea of fun, I'd hate to see what happens when you get bored.
I wanna love you, baby Hell, I can show you that right now.
For the hours I spent with you And I want to love you, baby, for holding me every day 'Cause when I start to worry, you know just what to say Yeah, we have enough love [GROWLING.]
We dug the hole a few years back.
Tried using a cat as bait, but we didn't catch anything, so we gave up.
Then, about six months ago, we came back, and voilÃ .
Dumb sack of shit must've just fallen in.
[LAUGHTER.]
You go.
Oh! Oh! Almost.
[LAUGHS.]
[BOTH LAUGH.]
Come on, Huckleberry.
[LAUGHS.]
Step right up and try your luck.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[RODNEY LAUGHS.]
- [GRUNTS.]
- Hey, what the hell? [GRUNTING.]
I'm sorry.
[STAFF PLUNGES.]
[GROWLING STOPS.]
Hey, asshole! What'd you do that for?! If I had to explain it, you wouldn't understand.
Whatever, man.
I'm outta here.
[GRUNTS.]
[THUNDER RUMBLING.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
EUGENE: You're gonna get me - [GROANING.]
- Come on.
It doesn't make any sense.
They shouldn't have doubled back like that.
And they definitely shouldn't have followed us all the way to the barn.
I do have a theory to posit.
The walkers are evolving.
Oh, that's bullshit.
They're dead, they're not evolving.
Being dead hasn't exactly stopped them from perambulating ad infinitum, though, has it? They're not dead in any sense that makes sense.
It takes an impact to the cranium to stop them, which means the brain is alive, degraded as it may be.
And if it's alive, it can change.
Maybe even start to remember things, too, like how to talk.
- What? - JESUS: It's not any crazier than the dead being alive in the first place.
If they can learn to talk, maybe they can learn strategy and how to hunt.
They're right on our asses.
We've gotta get to the horses fast.
You have to leave me behind.
I'm slowing you down and tiring you out.
- Every time we stop, the dead get closer.
- No! We came out here to find you - We're not going home without you.
- You don't have a choice.
It's not your call.
The numbers actually work for us.
We can split up.
You two get him back to the horses.
I'll wait for the herd to get here, then I'll draw them off in the other direction.
Then I'll ditch them and meet you back at the Hilltop.
We're stronger together.
That doesn't help us.
Our only way out of this is to avoid a fight.
No.
If anyone stays, it's gonna be me.
Go.
Hell, I'll probably beat you back.
- Go! - Come on.
Come here, boy.
Come on.
[EUGENE GRUNTING SOFTLY.]
[BALL BOUNCING.]
[BOUNCING STOPS.]

He threw up on a pig.
And then my boots.
- Sorry about that.
- Good.
I have too much to worry about tonight.
And I loved those boots.
I'm going back to bed.
[FOOTSTEPS DEPART.]
Thought you were too tired to do anything tonight.
"Beat from the trip," I think you said.
I assume from the reek of crappy moonshine coming off of you that that was a lie.
Yes, sir.
It was.
Tara says the guards found you outside the gate, shouting to be let back in.
You wanna tell me how you wound up out there? No, sir.
I do not.
Well, who gave you the booze? Okay, then.
I offered to take you on and teach you, but if this is how you treat your commitments, you can take your scrawny ass back to Kingdom.
Wait.
I know I screwed up.
But people back home are are counting on me.
My parents are are counting on me.
Well, I expect better, Henry.
What the hell got into you? I I saw my mom cry today.
She's so tough, you know? Before that, I was just too excited to really think and understand that this is a a huge deal.
I just [SIGHS.]
I don't know.
I guess I didn't wanna think about that for a while.
Well, I've been there.
Literally.
Right there on that cot.
The minimum sentence for drunk and disorderly is two days.
When Jesus gets back, I'll talk to him and see what I can do.
Thank you, Mr.
Sutton.
You better get some sleep.
You're gonna have a lot of work to catch up on when you get out.
