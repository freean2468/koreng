Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead You look at me, stay with me, you hear me? Bites kill you.
The fever burns you out.
But then after a while You come back.
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.
They're alive.
My wife and son.
That boy has been through too much, and he's not loosing his mother too.
Okay? Mom? You in the tank.
Cozy in there? ( Birds chirping ) Boy: Mom! Right here.
( Pots rattling ) Any luck? How do we tell if they're poison? Uh, there's only one sure way I know of.
Ask Shane when he gets back? Yeah, you've got it.
Thank you.
Dale, I'm heading out.
Sweetheart, I want you to stay where Dale can see you, okay? Yes, mom.
Dale: You too.
Don't wander too far.
Stay within shouting distance.
And if you see anything, holler.
I'll come running.
( Softly ) Yes, mom.
( Leaves rustle ) ( Bird wings flap ) - ( Branch snaps ) - ( Gasps ) ( Wings flap ) ( Branches snapping ) ( Gasps ) Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh.
You scared the hell out of me.
I bet.
That's what you get for keeping me waiting.
I was trying to be quiet.
- Where you been? - Amy the mushroom queen I had to wait for her to get back.
- How much time do we have? - Enough.
( Moans ) ( Both moaning ) - Come here.
- Okay.
( Both grunting ) ( Theme music playing ) ( zombies growling, moaning ) ( Radio beeping, hissing ) ( Zombies banging ) Man on radio: Hey, are you alive in there? ( Thuds, grunts ) - Hello? Hello? - There you are.
You had me wondering.
Where are you? Outside? Can you see me right now? Yeah, I can see you.
You're surrounded by walkers.
That's the bad news.
There's good news? - No.
- Listen, whoever you are, I don't mind telling you I'm a little concerned in here.
Oh man.
You should see it from over here.
You'd be having a major freak-out.
Got any advice for me? Yeah, I'd say make a run for it.
That's it? "Make a run for it"? My way's not as dumb as it sounds.
You've got eyes on the outside here.
There's one geek still up on the tank but the others have climbed down and joined the feeding frenzy where the horse went down.
- With me so far? - So far.
Okay, the street on the other side of the tank is less crowded.
If you move now while they're distracted, you stand a chance.
- Got ammo? - In that duffel bag I dropped out there, and guns.
Can I get to it? Forget the bag, okay? It's not an option.
- What do you have on you? - Hang on.
( Gun clicks, clatters ) Yeah.
Yeah.
I've got a Beretta with one clip, - 15 rounds.
- Make 'em count.
Jump off the right side of the tank, keep going in that direction.
There's an alley up the street, maybe 50 yards.
Be there.
Hey, what's your name? Have you been listening? You're running out of time.
Right.
( Breathing heavily ) ( Growling ) ( Groans ) - Ah! - ( Zombies moaning ) ( Gunshots ) Whoa! Not dead! Come on! Come on! Back here! Come on! Come on! ( Gunshot ) What are you doing?! Come on! ( Growling ) Come on, get up.
( Both panting ) Nice moves there, Clint Eastwood.
You the new sheriff come riding in to clean up the town? - It wasn't my intention.
- Yeah, whatever.
Yeehaw.
You're still a dumbass.
Rick.
Thanks.
Glenn.
You're welcome.
Oh no.
( Growling ) The bright side: It'll be the fall that kills us.
I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy.
Are you the one that barricaded the alley? Somebody did I guess when the city got overrun.
Whoever did it was thinking not many geeks would get through.
Back at the tank, why'd you stick your neck out for me? Call it foolish, naive hope that if I'm ever that far up shit creek, somebody might do the same for me.
Guess I'm an even bigger dumbass than you.
I'm back.
Got a guest plus four geeks in the alley.
( Zombies growling ) Let's go! Morales, let's go! You son of a bitch.
We ought to kill you.
- Just chill out, Andrea.
Back off.
- Come on, ease up.
Ease up? You're kidding me, right? We're dead because of this stupid asshole.
Andrea, I said back the hell off.
Well, pull the trigger.
We're dead All of us Because of you.
I don't understand.
Look, we came into the city to scavenge supplies.
You know what the key to scavenging is? Surviving! You know the key to surviving? Sneaking in and out, tiptoeing.
Not shooting up the streets like it's the O.
K.
Corral.
Every geek for miles around heard you popping off rounds.
You just rang the dinner bell.
Morales: Get the picture now? ( Growling ) Oh God.
What the hell were you doing out there anyway? Trying to flag the helicopter.
Helicopter? Man, that's crap.
- Ain't no damn helicopter.
- You were chasing a hallucination, - imagining things.
It happens.
- I saw it.
Hey, T-Dog, try that C.
B.
Can you contact the others? Others? The refugee center? Yeah, the refugee center.
They've got biscuits waiting at the oven for us.
Got no signal.
Maybe the roof.
- ( Gun firing ) - Oh no.
Is that Dixon? - What is that maniac doing? - Come on, let's go.
( Gun shots ) - Hey, Dixon, are you crazy?! - ( Dixon laughing ) - ( Gun fires ) - Oh jeez.
Hey! Y'all be more polite to a man with a gun! Huh? Ah! Only common sense.
- Man, you wasting bullets we ain't even got! - ( Laughs ) And you're bringing even more of them down on our ass! Man, just chill.
Bad enough I've got this taco-bender on my ass all day.
Now I'm gonna take orders from you? I don't think so, bro.
That'll be the day.
"That'll be the day"? You got something - you want to tell me? - Hey, T-Dog man, just leave it.
- No.
- All right? It ain't worth it.
Now Merle, just relax, okay? We've got enough trouble.
- You want to know the day? - Yeah.
I'll tell you the day, Mr.
"Yo.
" It's the day I take orders from a nigger.
- Mother - Hey, come on, Merle.
That's enough.
- Andrea: Come on.
- ( All shouting ) Dixon! Whoa, cut it out, man! Stop it! Dixon, get off him! Dixon, you're gonna hurt him.
Merle, cut it out! ( Grunts ) No no no, please.
Please.
( Thunder rumbling ) ( T-Dog whimpering ) - ( Yells ) - ( Grunts ) Yeah! All right! We're gonna have ourselves a little powwow, huh? Talk about who's in charge.
I vote me.
Anybody else? Huh? Democracy time, y'all.
Show of hands, huh? All in favor? Huh? Come on.
Let's see 'em.
Oh, come on.
All in favor? Yeah.
That's good.
Now that means I'm the boss, right? Yeah.
Anybody else? - Hmm? Anybody? - Rick: Yeah.
( Grunting ) - Who the hell are you, man?! - Officer friendly.
Look here, Merle.
Things are different now.
There are no niggers anymore.
No dumb-as-shit, inbred white-trash fools either.
Only dark meat and white meat.
There's us and the dead.
We survive this by pulling together, - not apart.
- Screw you, man.
I can see you make a habit of missing the point.
Yeah? Well, screw you twice.
- Ought to be polite to a man with a gun.
- ( Gun cocks ) Only common sense.
You wouldn't.
You're a cop.
All I am anymore is a man looking for his wife and son.
Anybody that gets in the way of that is gonna lose.
I'll give you a moment to think about that.
Got some on your nose there.
What are you gonna do? Arrest me? ( Laughs ) Hey! What are you doing? Man, that was my stuff! Hey! ( Grunts ) If I get loose, you'd better pray Yeah, you hear me, you pig?! - You hear me?! - Yeah, your voice carries.
Do you hear me, you filthy pig?! You're not Atlanta P.
D.
- Where you from? - Up the road a ways.
Well, officer friendly from up the road a ways, - welcome to the big city.
- ( Thunder rumbling ) ( Zombies moaning ) My God, it's like Times Square down there.
- How's that signal? - Like Dixon's brain Weak.
- Morales: Keep trying.
- Why? There's nothing they can do.
Not a damn thing.
Got some people outside the city is all.
There's no refugee center.
That's a pipe dream.
Then she's right.
We're on our own.
It's up to us to find a way out.
Good luck with that.
These streets ain't safe in this part of town from what I hear.
Ain't that right, sugar tits? Hey, honeybunch, what say you get me out of these cuffs, we go off somewhere and bump some uglies? - Gonna die anyway.
- I'd rather.
Rub muncher.
I figured as much.
The streets ain't safe.
Now there's an understatement.
What about under the streets? The sewers? Oh man.
Hey, Glenn, check the alley.
You see any manhole covers? ( Growling ) No, must be all out on the street where the geeks are.
Maybe not.
Old building like this built in the '20s Big structures often had drainage tunnels into the sewers in case of flooding down in the subbasements.
- Glenn: How do you know that? - It's my job was.
I worked in the city zoning office.
This is it? Are you sure? I really scoped this place out the other times I was here.
It's the only thing in the building that goes down.
But I've never gone down it.
Who'd want to, right? Oh.
Great.
- We'll be right behind you.
- No, you won't.
Not you.
Why not me? Think I can't? I wasn't Speak your mind.
Look, until now I always came here by myself In and out, grab a few things No problem.
The first time I bring a group Everything goes to hell.
No offense.
If you want me to go down this gnarly hole, fine But only if we do it my way.
It's tight down there.
If I run into something and have to get out quick, I don't want you all jammed up behind me getting me killed.
I'll take one person Not you either.
You've got Merle's gun and I've seen you shoot.
I'd feel better if you were out in that store watching those doors, covering our ass.
And you've got the only other gun, so you should go with him.
You be my wingman.
Jacqui stays here.
Something happens, yell down to us, - get us back up here in a hurry.
- Okay.
Okay, everybody knows their jobs.
( Water splashing ) ( Rats squeaking ) - ( Rat squeals ) - Dah! ( Zombies banging, growling ) Sorry for the gun in your face.
People do things when they're afraid.
Not that it was entirely unjustified.
You did get us into this.
If I get us out, would that make up for it? No, but it'd be a start.
Next time though, take the safety off.
It won't shoot otherwise.
- Oh.
- Is that your gun? It was a gift.
Why? Little red dot means it's ready to fire.
You may have occasion to use it.
Good to know.
T-Dog: Anybody out there? Hello? Anybody read? I'm hoping to hear somebody's voice 'cause I'm getting sick and tired of hearing mine.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.
Why don't you knock that crap off? You're giving me a headache, boy.
Why don't you pull your head out of your ass? Maybe your headache will go away.
( Chuckles ) Try some positivity for a change.
Damn.
I'll tell you what You get me out of these cuffs and I'll be all "Sammy Sunshine" positive for you.
Hey, see that hacksaw over there in that toolbag? Get it for me, hmm? Make it worth your while.
What do you say, man? Come on.
Get me out of these things.
So you can beat my ass again? Or call me nigger some more? Come on now.
It wasn't personal.
It's just that your kind and my kind ain't meant to mix.
That's all.
It don't mean we can't Work together, parley, as long as there's some kind of mutual gain involved.
So about that hacksaw I guess you want me to get that rifle over there too so you can shoot that cop when he comes back up, huh? - Huh.
- ( Door clangs ) ( Rats squeaking ) Yeah, we've got ourselves a sewer tunnel.
Jacqui was right.
Can we cut through it? If we had a blowtorch and half a day, sure.
Dale's hacksaw sure as hell won't do it.
- ( Rats squeaking ) - ( Crunching ) ( Growling ) ( Zombies banging, growling ) Oh.
See something you like? Not me, but I know someone who would My sister.
She's still such a kid in some ways.
Unicorns, dragons She's into all that stuff.
But mermaids They rule.
She loves mermaids.
Why not take it? There's a cop staring at me.
( Chuckles ) Would it be considered looting? I don't think those rules apply anymore.
Do you? ( Glass shatters ) - What did you find down there? - Not a way out.
We need to find a way And soon.
( Thunder rumbling ) That construction site, those trucks They always keep keys on hand.
You'll never make it past the walkers.
You got me out of that tank.
Yeah, but they were feeding.
They were distracted.
Can we distract them again? Right.
Listen to him.
He's onto something.
A diversion, like on "Hogan's Heroes.
" - God.
Give it a rest.
- They're drawn by sound, right? Right, like dogs.
They hear a sound, they come.
- Rick: What else? - Aside from they hear you? They see you, smell you and if they catch you, they eat you.
- They can tell us by smell? - Can't you? They smell dead, we don't.
It's pretty distinct.
If bad ideas were an olympic event, - this would take the gold.
- He's right.
Just stop, okay? Take some time to think this through.
How much time? They already got through one set of doors, that glass won't hold forever.
( Zombies growling ) ( Sighs ) Wayne Dunlap.
Georgia license.
Born in 1979.
He had $28 in his pocket when he died And a picture of a pretty girl.
"With love, from Rachel.
" He used to be like us Worrying about bills or the rent or the Super Bowl.
If I ever find my family, I'm gonna tell them about Wayne.
Glenn: One more thing He was an organ donor.
- ( Grunts ) - Oh! - Madre de Dios! - ( Chopping ) Oh! God! Gack! - Oh God.
- Andrea: Oh.
- ( All groan ) - Morales: Dios! Oh God.
( All groaning ) ( Groans ) Keep chopping.
( Glenn groaning ) - I am so gonna hurl.
- Later.
Everybody got gloves? Don't get any on your skin or in your eyes.
( All groaning ) Oh God! Oh jeez.
Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.
Think about something else Puppies and kittens.
Dead puppies and kittens.
( Vomiting ) That is just evil.
What is wrong with you? Next time let the cracker beat his ass.
- I'm sorry, yo.
- You suck.
- Do we smell like them? - Oh yeah.
Glenn.
Just in case.
If we make it back, be ready.
What about Merle Dixon? Give me the axe.
- We need we need more guts.
- Oh God! ( Door creaks ) ( Growling ) Hey, what's happening, man? Hey, T-Dog, try that C.
B.
Hey, come on.
Talk to me, y'all.
Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me? Can anybody out there hear me? - There.
- ( Thunder rumbling ) That asshole is out on the street with the handcuff keys? Boy, that hose isn't long for this world, is it? No sir.
Where the hell are we gonna find a replacement? It's late.
They should've been back by now.
Worrying won't make it better.
- Shane: Attaboy.
- Carl: Yeah.
Shane: And three, two, one pull it.
- Carl: Ah! Aw.
- ( Both laugh ) Start it over.
Make your "p" the other way around your finger.
- Oops.
- Good, just tie it like around your finger.
Attaboy.
- ( Radio squawks ) - T-Dog: Hello, base camp! Can anybody out there hear me? Base camp, this is T-Dog.
Anybody hear me? Hello? Hello? Reception's bad on this end.
- Repeat.
Repeat.
- Shane, is that you? Is that them? - ( Static ) - We're in some deep shit.
We're trapped in the department store.
- He say they're trapped? - There are geeks all over the place.
Hundreds of 'em.
We're surrounded.
T-Dog, repeat that last.
Repeat.
( Static ) - ( Radio stops ) - He said the department store.
Dale: I heard it too.
- Lori: Shane? - No way.
We do not go after them.
We do not risk the rest of the group.
- Y'all know that.
- So we're just gonna leave her there? Look, Amy, I know that this is not easy She volunteered to go to help the rest of us.
I know, and she knew the risks, right? See, if she's trapped, she's gone.
So we just have to deal with that.
There's nothing we can do.
She's my sister, you son of a bitch.
- ( Thunder rumbling ) - Lori: Amy Come on.
It's all right, buddy.
( Growling ) ( Whispers ) It's gonna work.
I can't believe it.
( Whispers ) Don't draw attention.
( Growling ) ( Growling ) ( Rain pattering ) Oh man.
( Thunder crashes ) It's just a cloudburst.
We get 'em all the time.
It'll pass real quick.
( Growling ) The smell's washing off.
Isn't it? - Is it washing off? - No, it's not.
- Well, maybe.
- ( Roars ) Run! ( Zombies roaring ) Come on, come on, come on.
( Gunshots ) Rick! ( Engine starts ) Go go go go! ( Tires screech ) - They're leaving us.
- Dixon: What? What? - Where they going? Where they going? - No no, come back.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
They're all over that place.
You need to draw them away.
Those roll-up doors at the front of the store That area? That's what I need cleared.
Raise your friends.
Tell them to get down there and be ready.
And I'm drawing the geeks away how? I I missed that part.
Noise.
