Little girl? I'm a policeman.
Little girl.
Don't be afraid, OK? Little girl.
What's the difference between men and women? - Is this a joke? - No, serious.
I never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light.
They're born thinking the switch only goes one way On.
They're struck blind the second they leave a room.
I mean every woman, I ever let have a key I swear to God.
It's like I come home, house is all lit up, and my job, you see, apparently because because my chromosomes happen to be different cause I then gotta walk through that house, turn off every single light this chick left on.
- Is that right? - Yeah, baby.
Alright, Reverend Shane's preaching to you now, boy.
The same chick, mind ya.
She'll bitch about global warming.
That's when Reverend Shane wants to quote from the Guy Gospel and say "Um, darling?" "maybe you, and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figured out that the light switch see, goes both ways," maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming.
" - You say that? - Yeah.
Anyway, uh Polite version Still man, that that earns me this.
This look and loathing you would not believe.
And that's when the exorcist voice pops out.
"You sound just like my damn father.
"Always, always yelling about the power bill," "telling me to turn off the damn lights.
" What do you say to that? You know what I wanna say.
I wanna say,"Bitch, you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life "and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch? You know I don't actually say that, tho.
- That would be bad.
- Yeah, go with the uh the polite version there - Very wise.
- Yes, sir.
So how's it with Lori, man? She's good.
She's good at turning off lights.
Really good.
And I'm the one who sometimes forget.
Not what I meant.
We didn't have a great night.
Look, man, I may have a fail to amuse with my sermon, but I did try.
The least you could do is speak.
That's what she always says: "Speak".
"Speak".
You think I was the most closed mouth son of a bitch you'd ever hear to hear her tell it.
Do you express your thoughts? You share your feelings and that kind of stuff? The thing is lately whenever I try everything I say makes her impatient, like she didn't want to hear it after all.
It's like she's pissed at me all the time, and I don't know why.
Look, man, that's just shit couples go through.
Nah, it's It's a phase.
Last thing she said this morning? Sometimes I wonder if you even care about us at all.
She said that in front of our kid.
Imagine going to school with that in your head.
Difference between men and women? I would never say something that cruel to her.
Certainly not in front of Carl.

Hey, we'll get them on one of those video shows, you know, like World's craziest police chases, what do you think? What I think, Leon, is that you need to stay focused.
Make sure you got a round in the chamber and your safety off.
Would be kind of cool to get on one of them shows.
Holy shit.

- Put it down! Put the gun down! - Rick! - I'm alright! I saw you get tagged, man, it scared the hell out of me.

Everybody pitched in on these.

Linda and Diane from dispatch, they picked these out.
You probably could tell, hmm? I'll just set this on your side table, ok? That vase has something special.
Fess up.

I hope you left her that spoon collection.
Shane? Shane, you in the john? Nurse, help.

- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.
Hey, mister! What's that bandage for? - What? - What kind of wound? You answer me, damn you! What's your wound? You tell me! Or I will kill you.
Got that bandage changed out.
It was pretty rank.
What was? The wound? - Gun shot.
- Gun shot? What else? Anything? Gun shot ain't enough? Look, I ask and you answer, It's common courtesy, right? Did you get bit? - Bit? - Bit.
Chewed.
Maybe scratch? Anything like that.
No, I got shot.
Just shot, as far as I know.
Hey Just let me Feels cooler now.
Fever would have killed you by now.
I don't think I have one.
Be hard to miss.
Take a moment, eh? Look how sharp it is.
You try anything I will kill you with it, and don't you think I won't.
Come on up when you're able.
Come on.
This place It's Fred and Cindy Drake's.
Never met them.
I've been here.
This is their place It was empty when we got here.
Don't do that.
They'll see the light.
There's more of them out there than usual.
I never should have fired that gun today.
The sound draws them, now they're all over the street.
Stupid using a gun It all happened so fast - I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.
Man? No man What the hell was that out of your mouth just now? - It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.
In this street, out front, a man.
For him, you need glasses, that was a walker.
Come on.
Sit down, before you fall down.
Here.
Eat.
Daddy Blessing Yeah.
Father, we thank thee for this food Thy blessings We ask you to watch over us in these crazy days.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Hey, mister, do you even know what is going on? I woke up today.
In a hospital.
Came home, that's all I know.
- But you know about the dead people, right? - Yeah, I saw a lot of that.
Out on the loading dock, hauling trucks.
No Not the one's they put down The one's they didn't.
The walkers.
Like the one I shot today.
Cause he would have ripped into you.
Try to eat you, take him some flesh at least.
But I guess if this is the first you're hearing, I know how it must sound - They're out there now, in the street? - Yeah.
They're even more active after dark sometimes.
Maybe it's the cool air or Hell, maybe it's just me firing up that gun today.
But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet.
Probably wander off by morning.
Well, listen One thing I do know Don't you get bit! We saw your bandage and that's why we were afraid of.
Bites kill you.
The fever burns you out.
But then after a while You come back.
Seen it happen Come on Carl He your son? William.
He said his name today He's a little younger than your boy.
And he's with his mother? I hope so.
- Dad? - Yeah? Did you ask him? Your gun shot We got a little bet going.
My boy say you're a bank robber YeahThat's me.
Deadly as Dillinger Kapow.
Sheriff's deputy Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.
It's nothing.
One of them must've bumped a car You sure? Happened once before.
Went off a few minutes.
Get the light, Dwayne.
It's the blue one, down the street.
Same one as last time.
I think we're ok.
That noise Will it bring more of them? Nothing to do about it now.
Just have to wait 'em out till morning.
She's here.
Don't look.
Get away from the windows.
I said go! Come on! Come on, quiet.
It's ok, here.
Cry into the pillow.
Can you remember? She, uh She died in the other room, on that bed Nothin' I can do about it here That fever, man Her skin gave off heat like a furnace Should have put her down, I should have put her down, I know that, but You know what I just didn't have it in me She's the mother of my child.
You sure? They're dead.
They have to ask, at least one more time.
They're dead.
Except for something in the brain.
That's why it's gotta be the head.
You alright? Need a moment They're alive.
My wife and son.
At least they were when they left.
How can you know? By the look of this place I found empty drawers in the bedroom.
They packed some clothes.
Not a lot.
But enough to travel.
You know anybody could've broken in here and stolen clothes, right? You see the framed photos on the walls? Neither do I.
Some random thief took those too, you think? My photo albums, family pictures, all gone.
Photo albums My wife Same thing Here I am, packing survival gear, she's grabbing photo albums.
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.
That's right.
- Why there? - Refugee settle.
Huge, when they said it, before the broadcast stopped.
Military protection food, shelter They told people to go there.
Said to be safest.
Plus they got that disease place.
Center for Disease Control.

Atlanta sounds like a good deal.
Safer anyway.
People That's where we were heading.
Things got crazy.
Man, you won't believe.
The panic Streets won't fit to be on, and then we'll My wife couldn't travel.
No, not with our herds, so we had to find a place to lay low.
And then, after she died We just stayed hunkered down.
I guess we just froze in place.
Plan to move on? Haven't worked up to it yet.
A lot of it's gone missing.
Dad, can I learn to shoot? I'm old enough.
Hell yes you're going to learn.
We gotta do it carefully, teach you to respect the weapon.

You pull the trigger, you have to mean it.
Always remember that, Dwayne.
