1 (Announcer) Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead" I mapped out some of the agricultural supply places in the area.
(Grunting) - What's your name? - Call me Jesus.
He swiped your keys, didn't he? (Grunting) (Man) Rick, wake up! (gun cocking, sword unsheathing) We should talk.
Abraham: So there we were, scraping our sacks in the sandbox.
Open targets in the dunes.
All of us sweating and swearing.
Sure as hell beat sitting on our asses 30 clicks to nowhere waiting for our humpbacked friend to defecate the keys to our transport.
Sasha: Camels don't eat keys.
They do, it did.
And it shit it out.
(chuckles) I shit you not.
You're an idiot.
I've never denied it.
(giggles) Brave new world.
I still can't stop thinking about Maggie having a pup.
In this.
What about it? You know, the way things go.
The way they can.
Yeah.
Maybe that's why.
Because the way things go.
Uh You already called me an idiot.
Never had to.
(chuckles) Yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Nope.
I'm, uh, starting a new shift.
The watch post on Baggarly.
That so? Yeah, I already talked to Eugene.
He wants to help out more.
Said he'd take over my patrol with you.
Uh how about that? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
How about that? Um see you around? Yeah.
Yeah.
See you around, Abraham.
(sighs) Hey.
Hey, Abraham.
Hey.
You're still here? You know Eugene's gonna start patrolling? Mm-hmm.
He asked me to teach him how to fieldstrip automatics.
He's gonna teach me chemistry.
Mm.
You can't teach chemistry.
- (laughs) Really? - Mm-mm.
(moans) Sweet flaming mercy.
That was just beyond.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah? Mm.
Catch.
It's from the fuel truck.
Had to crack a brake light.
You made this? Thought your neck looked a little lonely.
Rosita Espinosa, you are damn near perfection, you know that? (chuckles) Show me.
In the shower.
In a minute.
(water running) Glenn: Maggie.
Hey.
We get the trellises in, we can start going vertically.
Double our yield of tomatoes per square foot.
We can only keep stretching our rations so far.
Still haven't seen a single bud.
Babe.
It'll grow.
We're gonna be okay.
(gate opens) (sighs) What the hell are you doing in our house? I'm, uh, sitting on the steps looking at this painting, waiting for your mom and dad to get dressed.
Hi - I'm Jesus.
- (door opens) (footsteps approach) Carl, hey, um - (door closes) - (hammers click) It's-- it's okay.
Rick: You said we should talk.
So let's talk.
So, how'd you get out? One guard can't cover two exits or third floor windows.
Knots untie and locks get picked.
- Entropy comes from order, right? - Right.
I checked out your arsenal.
I haven't seen anything like that in a long time.
You're well-equipped, but your provisions are low.
Very low for the amount of people you have.
- 54? - More than that.
Well, I appreciate the cookie.
My compliments to the chef.
Yeah, she ain't here.
Look, we got off to a bad start.
But we're on the same side-- the living side.
You and Rick had every reason to leave me out there, but you didn't.
I'm from a place that's a lot like this one.
Part of my job is searching out other settlements to trade with.
I took your truck because my community needs things, and both of you looked like trouble.
I was wrong.
You're good people.
And this is a good place.
I think our communities may be in a position to help each other.
Do you have food? We've started to raise livestock.
We scavenge, we grow.
Everything from tomatoes to sorghum.
Tell us why we should believe you.
I'll show you.
If we take a car, I can take you back home in a day, and you can all see for yourselves who we are and what we have to offer.
Wait, you're looking for more settlements.
You mean you're already trading with other groups? Your world's about to get a whole lot bigger.
(theme music playing) Here.
Homemade oat cake.
Complex carbohydrates, omega-3s.
Nah, I'm good.
We're gonna make a pit stop.
I'll pick up something then.
Like rabies? Is this 'cause I tried to get you that stuff? Yeah.
And you remind me of someone I used to know.
Well I hope it tastes better than it looks.
'Cause it looks like shit.
Shit's still better than roadkill.
Okay, maybe-- just eat it.
You sure? No.
But if he's telling the truth, this could be the start of everything.
(chatter) Look, I was gonna tell you about me and Michonne, but it just happened.
It just happened.
Last night.
This is-- this is different.
It's cool.
All right.
Well, get your stuff.
Gabriel can take care of Judith while we're gone.
No, I'm not coming.
Someone's gotta stay back, keep this place safe.
A kid with a messed-up face probably wouldn't make the best first impression anyway.
(babbling) Let's chew up some asphalt! Hey.
Can I ask you a question? Sure.
When you were, uh, pouring the Bisquick, were you trying to make pancakes? Uh yes? Oh, okay, um it's something that we talked about, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Why? No, I just Well, given the precarious state of affairs on any given Sunday, I am damn near floored that you or anyone else would have the cojones to make a call like that.
I mean, well we're trying to build something, me and her.
All of us.
For the record, I see rain coming, I'm wearing galoshes.
I double up.
(brakes squealing) Yo, Rick.
What's going on? We got a crash ahead.
Looks like it just happened.
It's one of ours.
(walkers snarling) If this is a trick, it won't end well for you.
My people are in trouble.
They don't-- we don't have a lot of fighters.
I know how it looks, but I'll play it out.
Can I borrow a gun? No.
We got tracks right here.
(bangs on door) Jesus: They gotta be in there.
We moving in or what? How do we know this ain't firecrackers in a trash can? You don't.
We'll get your people.
You're staying here with one of us.
That's the deal.
- Glenn: Will you stay? - Maggie: Yeah.
Y'all go.
Just be careful.
Yeah.
We're gonna be careful.
Just hurry.
You hear me whistle, shoot him.
I will.
(walkers snarling) (snarling continues) - (grunting) - (flesh squelching) Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're friends of Jesus.
We're here to get you out.
- There more of you? - Two more.
They ran ahead.
(walkers snarling) (snarling) (clatter) Come on.
We're with Jesus.
Let's go.
I can't go with you.
I'm looking for my friend.
He's close, and he's hurt from the crash.
(walkers snarling) - (man yelling) - (walker snarling) No! Daryl: Come on, man, let's go.
Come on! - You got him? - Go.
Come on.
Come on.
(walker growls) Name's Harlan, by the way.
Maggie.
That's my husband, Glenn.
Harlan: We're bringing back medication, so you may have saved more people than just us back there, Glenn.
- You're a doctor? - Yeah, that's right.
You have any prenatal vitamins in there? - For you? - Mm-hmm.
Well, uh, I was an obstetrician before, and I most definitely owe you.
So, I'd say you two just hit the jackpot.
You okay, Freddie? For a second back there, just when I thought he was gonna I saw my wife.
She died before all this.
(voice breaking) Just when I thought it was over, there she was.
(laughs) Clear as day.
(splats) (tires spinning) Damn it.
(revs motor) A storm must've passed through.
We're stuck.
No worries.
We're here.
That's us.
That's the Hilltop.
Man: Stop right there.
- Whoa! - Daryl: You gonna make us? Jesus, what the hell is this? Open the gates, Cal.
Freddie's hurt.
Look, sorry about these guys.
They get antsy standing up there all day doing nothing.
They give up the weapons.
Then we'll open the gates.
Why don't you come down here and get 'em? Gentlemen, look, we vouch for these people, all right? They saved us out there.
Jesus: Lower the spears.
Look, I'm not taking any chances.
Tell your guy Gregory to come out here.
No.
Don't you see what just happened? I'm letting you keep your guns.
Look, we ran out of ammo months ago.
I like you people.
I trust you.
Trust us.
Open the gates, Cal.
(gates squeaking) (clucking) Hey, thanks again.
Come see me whenever.
I'm just over here in the medical trailer, okay? There was a materials yard for a power company nearby.
That's how we put up the walls.
A lot of people came from a FEMA camp.
Trailers came with them.
How did people find out about this place? That's called Barrington House.
The family that owned it gave it to the state in the '30s.
The state turned it into a living history museum.
Every elementary school for 50 miles used to come here for field trips.
The place was running a long time before the modern world built up around it.
I think people came here because they figured it'd keep running after the modern world broke down.
Those windows up there let us see for miles in every direction.
It's perfect for security.
Come on.
I'll show you inside.
Good gracious, Ignatius.
Jesus: Most of the rooms have been converted to living spaces.
Even the ones that weren't bedrooms.
People live here and the trailers? We plan to build.
There's babies being born.
Jesus.
You're back.
With guests.
Jesus: Everyone, this is Gregory.
He keeps the trains running on time around here.
I'm the boss.
Well, I'm Rick.
We have a community-- Why don't y'all go get cleaned up, hmm? We're fine.
Jesus will show you where you can get washed up.
Then come back down here when you're ready.
It's hard to keep this place clean.
Yeah.
Sure.
Follow me.
You clean up first.
You talk to him.
Why? I shouldn't.
And you gotta start doing these things.
How long do you think Rick and Michonne been ugging bumplies? I don't know.
You ever think about it? Settling down? You think shit's settled? Gregory.
- Natalie, right? - Maggie.
That's pretty close.
Not really.
She calls them like she sees them.
I like that.
Come in, let's chat.
Yeah.
I-- I came to this place once before, when it was a museum, this, um, Chamber of Commerce thing.
Love that painting.
I never figured it'd be mine, here it is.
It's like it was waiting for me the whole time.
Hmm.
Jesus told me your group saved Dr.
Carson.
Obviously, a doctor's a rare commodity today, so I want to thank you for bringing ours back.
My husband saved him.
I'll be sure to thank him, too.
This place, what you have here, has been here since the start? That's right.
And how-- how is it-- how have you survived here? You're looking at how.
I'm good at this.
And I don't get hung up on the details.
Where you live, is it as nice as the Hilltop Colony? It's just different.
How do you feed everyone? Jesus said you had land for gardens, but no crops.
We just started planting.
- Planting what? - Cucumbers, tomatoes.
Oh, crops-- soy, corn, hemp, sorghum.
- Garden stuff.
- But you have guns, so I assume you have a decent weapons cache.
It's decent.
And your infirmary, is it stocked? Is yours? We came here hoping to talk trade.
Do you have enough here for that? You see what I have here.
You see what I've built.
Jesus said that your food situation was challenged right now.
You don't keep people fed, it comes apart.
Let's speak the common tongue here, huh? You don't have shit.
Now, I'm happy to help.
I'm a nice guy.
But we can't just give things away for free.
How's this? Since you can't offer much, I'll let your people work here for their share.
You'd be a welcome addition to the community, a smart and beautiful woman.
Getting back to that common tongue, I can tell ya, I can make it worth your while.
- Let me stop you right there.
- Listen, honey.
Stop coming on to me with calling me honey.
You don't have any ammunition.
Who said that? You're low on medication.
You need things.
We need things.
What, are you gonna give us a bottle of aspirin and a box of bullets? Our communities can help each other.
Thank you, Natalie.
Been a good talk.
We can help each other.
We're doing fine.
Are you? Jesus: We want to generate trade.
Gregory does.
But ammo isn't something we urgently need.
- Well, how's that? - The walls hold.
We just brought in more medicine.
Gregory wants the best deal possible.
Yeah, well, we want things, too.
Rick: We need food.
We came all this way, we're gonna get it.
I will talk to him and we will work this out.
Circumstances change.
We're doing well now, and you will next.
I will make him understand that.
Can you give me a few days? We can.
Yeah.
(soft laugh) What's wrong? They're back.
Gregory: Nathan, what happened to everybody else? Where's Tim and Marsha? They're dead.
- Negan? - Yeah.
- We had a deal.
- Man: He said it wasn't enough.
Was the drop light? Gregory: No.
They still have Craig.
They said they'd keep him alive, return him to us, if I deliver a message to you.
So, tell me.
I'm sorry.
- (groans) - (flesh squelches) Get off of me! I had to! (grunting) - (ears ringing) - (heart pounding) Sasha's voice: Maybe that's why.
Because the way things go.
(screams) - (yells) - Glenn: Hey! Stay back! Anybody who tries to stop me is killing my brother! Michonne: Drop it.
(groaning) (groaning) What? Nathan! You killed him.
He tried to kill Gregory, then me.
(grunts) Ah! Don't.
Drop it now! I don't think I will.
Everyone, this is over! (panting) It's over.
Ethan was our friend, but let's not pretend he was anything more than a coward who attacked us.
He did this.
And these people stopped him.
(crying) What can I do? Put the gun away.
You've done enough.
You need to know that things aren't as simple as they might seem.
Just give me some time.
(groaning) - Daryl: Hey, man.
- Huh? You good? Yeah.
I'm better than all right.
(laughs) (Abraham grunts) (door opens) Jesus: Dr.
Carson was able to patch Gregory up.
He's in pain, but he'll live.
So, what happens now? Things like that don't usually happen here, but, uh, it's settled.
We heard the name Negan.
A while back, Daryl and Abraham had a run-in with his men.
Who is he? Negan's the head of a group of people he calls the Saviors.
As soon as the walls were built, the Saviors showed up.
They met with Gregory on behalf of their boss.
They made a lot of demands, even more threats.
And he killed one of us-- Rory.
He was 16 years old.
They beat him to death right in front of us.
Said we needed to understand, right off the bat.
Gregory's not exactly good at confrontation.
He's not the leader I would've chosen, but he helped make this place what it is, and the people like him.
He made the deal.
Jesus: Half of everything.
Our supplies, our crops, our livestock, it goes to the Saviors.
And what do you get in return? They don't attack this place.
They don't kill us.
Why not just kill them? Most of the people here don't even know how to fight, even if we had ammo.
Well, how many people does Negan have? We don't know.
We've seen groups as big as 20.
Now, hold up.
So, they show up, they kill a kid, and you give them half of everything? These dicks just got a good story.
The bogeyman, he ain't shit.
Well, how do you know? A month ago, we took his guys out PDQ.
Left them in pieces and puddles.
You know, we'll do it.
If we go get your man back, kill Negan, take out his boys, will you hook us up? We want food, medicine, and one of them cows.
Confrontation's never been something we've had trouble with.
I'll take it to Gregory.
They have food, we don't.
We don't have enough of anything.
Except us.
What we can do.
This is the trade.
It's gonna cost us something.
(door opens) Gregory's up.
He wants to talk.
To Maggie.
He wants to talk to Maggie.
You got this.
Deanna was right about you.
I'm sorry in advance.
Gregory can be a real prick.
I know.
(knock on door) Come in.
Mm.
Sorry for the gloom.
They have me on these antibiotics that make me sensitive to the sunlight.
This is agony.
It's like somebody's twisting my intestines with a cement mixer.
It could've been worse.
You're lucky we were here.
Jesus told you about our offer? He did.
What makes you think you can do what we haven't done? We've handled people like Negan.
- How? - They're dead.
We can get your man back.
I don't know if Craig's worth the trouble.
I mean, it's his brother who did this.
He was fighting to save someone he loves.
He was afraid.
That makes him weak.
Frankly, I don't know if I want him back in our gene pool.
My dad used to tell me forgiveness takes more strength than anger.
Yeah, I guess.
He's a hell of a cook.
He makes these amazing baked eggs with green tomatoes.
You give us supplies, we'll save Craig and take care of Negan and the Saviors, permanently.
(Gregory laughs) I'm sorry, I find this whole conversation pretty funny.
I mean, you balked when I proposed that your people work for our supplies, but now isn't that exactly what's happening here? See, I had leverage and I used it.
See? It wasn't personal.
Yes.
We need food.
You have it.
We're willing to work for it.
Then I'll get supplies for your people.
Good.
I'll talk to Jesus and he'll make the arrangements.
See, this was fun.
Exciting.
Half.
Excuse me? Half of what you have.
I saw what happened out there.
Negan's expecting more supplies from this place.
And more and more.
And if it keeps going like that, pretty soon you won't have anything left.
What happens then? Without ammo, without fighters you'd be a dead man.
So half of everything you have right now or the deal's off.
You see? I have leverage.
(groans) Congratulations.
You have yourself a deal.
You want anything else? Kidney, maybe? Not that but I do want something.
Even Negan didn't get this much up front.
What? Jesus said you've been taking supplies to Negan since the beginning.
We're gonna get Craig back.
The only way to get Craig back is to bring them Gregory's head.
We're gonna get Craig back.
How? We need to know what you know about Negan's compound.
We need your help.
We need you to come.
Yeah.
Okay.
You got room for one more, right? I mean, we're talking about righting the world here.
Plus, you still have my knives.
(chuckles) Hey, you up for this? It's gonna be a fight.
We'll win.
We have to.
We'll win.
(heart beating) (sighs) (theme music playing)
