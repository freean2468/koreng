1 (announcer) Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead" You are mine.
The people back there they are mine.
You failed.
Your life was about to get so much cooler.
Screw it.
You answer to me! You provide for me! I provide for you.
You belong to me! Right? Right.
[Clock ticking.]
[Breathes deeply.]
[Ticking continues.]
[Weapon thuds lightly.]
[Bag rustling.]
[Door creaks.]
[Birds chirp in distance.]
[Birds chirping, crows cawing.]
[Bag thuds.]
[Chirping continues.]
Good morning.
Tch-tch-tch.
Oh, here, look at that.
- Shh.
-[Fusses.]
[Vehicle approaching.]
Could you open the gate? [Sharply.]
Eugene.
Yeah? [Exasperated voice.]
Open the gate.
Goin' out to see if we can find anything for when they come.
You want to help? [Engine idling.]
I don't believe I'd be up to that.
Yeah, sounds about right.
I'm repairin' this portable audio system for them.
We'll have a perfectly respectable music player when they arrive.
I'm dealing in certainties, and I'm doing my part to give them what they want.
[Vehicles, motorcycles approaching.]
[Air brakes hissing.]
[Whistling brightly.]
Dun-dun-dun dun [Banging.]
[Singsong voice.]
Little pig, little pig, let me in! [Gate rattles.]
Well? Um, who are you? Oh, you better be jokin'.
Negan, Lucille.
I know I had to make a pretty strong first impression.
Well, hello, there.
Do not make me have to ask.
You said a week.
You're early.
[Gate creaking.]
I missed you.
[Walker growling.]
[Chuckles.]
Oh, Rick, come on out here.
Watch this.
Calling it! [Walker growling.]
[Grunts.]
[Body thuds.]
Ha ha ha! Easy peasy lemon squeezy! All right, everybody.
Let's get started.
Big day.
Hey, Rick, you see that, what I just did? That is some service! I mean, we almost get turned away at the gate.
"Who is that guy, anyway?" Do I get mad? Do I throw a fit? Do I bash some ginger's dome in? Nope.
I just take care of one of these dead pricks that could've killed one of y'all.
Service.
Hold this.
[Ominous music builds.]
Hot diggity dog! This place is magnificent! An embarrassment of riches, as they say.
Yes, sir, I do believe you are gonna have plenty to offer up.
[Chuckles.]
Daryl, hey -- [Sternly.]
No.
Nope.
He's the help.
You don't look at him, you don't talk to him, and I don't make you chop anything off of him.
[Low-key sinister music plays.]
Same goes for everyone Right? [Exhales sharply.]
A lot of suspense there.
I don't think she even knew how much.
All right, let's get this show on the road.
See what kind of goodies you got in the cupboard.
We put aside half the supplies.
No, Rick.
No.
You don't decide what we take.
I do.
Arat.
You heard the man.
Move out! They're just gonna search the houses a bit, keep the process movin'.
[Sighs.]
All right.
You gonna show me around or not? Well? [Singsong voice.]
Rosita! Where you going with your friend here? We were just heading back to -- You know what? I don't care.
[Sighs.]
[Sighing.]
[Sighs.]
Now that that's all settled, I got a job for ya.
Go get me Daryl's bike.
It ain't here.
Well, if it ain't here, then you know where it is, right? We both know you know where it is.
[Sharply.]
Uh Now you're good to go.
So go.
Oh, oh.
[Car door slams.]
Oh.
[Sighs.]
Don't take too long.
[Engine starts.]
[Birds chirping.]
[Growling in distance.]
[Gunshot booms.]
[Shell casing rattles.]
[Gunshot booms.]
[Shell casing rattles.]
[Gunshot booms.]
[Gunshot booms.]
[Shell casing rattles.]
[Walker growling.]
[Gunshots booming.]
[Growling continues.]
[Panting.]
Damn it.
[Growling.]
Negan: You see this? This is the kind of thing that just tickles my balls.
A little cooperation and everything is pleasant as punch.
You see, we really are reasonable people once you get to know us.
Honest.
Ohh.
Man.
[Tab pops.]
Ahh! [Can thuds lightly.]
Damn, I love this place! Man: Negan.
Somethin' you might wanna see.
Well, well, well.
What do we have here? I got my fingers crossed for a little freaky-deaky.
[Video camera beeps.]
Rick: know me.
I've killed people.
I don't even know how many by now.
Jee-hee-sus! But I know why they're all dead.
Is that you, Rick, underneath all that man-bush? They're dead so my family, all those people out there, can be alive.
Shee-ot.
I would not have messed with that guy.
[Video camera beeps.]
But that's not you anymore is it? Nope.
I really gotta shave this shit.
Whatever happened to that sick girl? That seemed like a hell of a stressful night for her.
The way she was carrying on, she was married to number two, right? Careful.
Careful how you're lookin' at me, Rick.
Widows, especially ones that look like that [Exhales sharply.]
theyare special.
I love 'em.
Right after their husbands go, they are just empty side.
[Singsong voice.]
But usually not for long.
[Chuckles suggestively.]
Ahh.
Where is she? I would love to see her.
Father Gabriel: Do you care to pay your respects? Ho-ly crap! You are creepy as shit, sneaking up on me, wearin' that collar with that freaky-ass smile.
My apologies.
I'm Father Gabriel.
[Chuckles.]
She didn't make it? Damn tragedy.
That's what this is.
[Breathes deeply.]
Well, this must really suck for you guys.
Number one? That was on me.
No choice there.
Lessons had to be learned.
But number two? That didn't need to happen.
Daryl, there, he forced my hand.
Probably put her right on her back, huh? Damn.
I was gonna ask her to come back with me.
Oh, I know what you're thinkin'.
How could I have a shot, guy that just bashed her husband's head in? [Chuckles.]
You'd be surprised.
Boy, people, they -- [Gunshot in distance, glass shatters.]
[Ominous music plays.]
Put some back or the next one goes in you.
[Chuckles.]
Kid what do you think happens next? You die.
Carl, Carl, put it down.
No.
He's taking all of our medicine.
They said only half our stuff.
Negan: Of course.
Oh-ho.
Really, kid? And you should go.
Before you find out how dangerous we all are.
Well, pardon me, young man.
Excuse the shit out of my goddamn French, but did you just threaten me? Look, I get threatening Davey here, but I can't have it.
Not him, not me.
Carl, just put it down.
Negan: Don't be rude, Rick.
We are having a conversation here.
Now, boy, where were we? Oh, yeah.
Your giant, man-sized balls.
No threatening us.
Listen, I like you, so I don't want to go hard proving a point here.
You don't want that.
I said half your shit, and half is what I say it is.
I'm serious.
Do you want me to prove how serious? Again? [Sighs.]
[Exhales sharply.]
[Sighs.]
You know, Rick, this whole thing reminds me that you have a lot of guns.
There's all the guns you took from my outpost when you wasted all my people with a shit-ton of your own guns, and I'm bettin' there's even more, which adds up to an absolute ass-load of guns, and as this little emotional outburst just made crystal clear I can't allow that.
They're all mine now.
So tell me, Rick -- where are my guns? [Garage door motor whirring.]
Olivia: Ifigured you were coming.
Show him where the guns are, Olivia.
The armory's inside.
Negan: You run the show in here? I I just keep track of it all, the rations, the guns.
Good.
Smart.
Don't let me stop you.
Take her out, boys.
Show 'em the goods.
Wait, wait, wait.
Negan: While they're at it, I just want to point out to you that I'm not taking a scrap of your food.
Slim pickin's in here.
And I can't be the only one to notice that you got a fat lady in charge of keeping track of rations, can I? Either way, you starve to death, I don't get shit, so for now, you get to keep all the food.
How 'bout that? What do you want me to say? I don't know, Rick.
How about a thank you.
You think that might be in order? Or is that too much to ask?! [Chuckles.]
Ohh.
I know we started off on the wrong foot, but what can I say? You forced my hand, Rick.
But it's like I've been tryin' to tell you -- I'm a very reasonable man as long as you cooperate, so let me ask you a question, Rick.
Are you cooperating? What's it look like? Oh-ho-ho.
I know what it looks like.
But what I really want to know is if we're gonna find all the guns back there or if maybe you got a few just waitin' for their moment just like my Lucille.
They're all in there, to the best of my knowledge.
Mm.
I am countin' on that, Rick.
[Engine shuts off.]
[Car doors close.]
Still here.
Look, I know this sucks, but you saw what happened.
You saw how many of them are there today.
That's it.
It's over.
This is our life now.
This is where Rick got us.
Maybe if Rick thought it through, it would've been different.
[Thudding.]
People might still be with us.
This is where we are.
We just got to learn to live with it.
[Clatter.]
Rosita! You know what today is, Rick? Today is a banner day.
Yes, it is.
I think this little arrangement we have is gonna work out just fine.
Hold up.
Let's see if you've been taking care of my guns.
[Gun cocks.]
[Gunshot, glass shatters.]
[Chuckles.]
Feels good.
Sounds good! Oh, I do believe Lucille's gettin' a little jealous.
Well, ho-ly smokes! Look at this! It was you guys that took out Little Timmy and the Dick Brigade? Wow, Rick.
Gettin' in your last licks.
Ooh, man, I'm gonna have some fun with this.
Please, I-I don't know for -- Arat, we don't do that unless they do somethin' to deserve it.
Yeah, we went through the inventory.
Guns in the armory, guns they had around the walls, they're short.
Glock 9 and a .
22 Bobcat.
Is that true? [Ominous music plays.]
We had some people leave town.
Those guns probably went with them.
So Olivia sucks at her job.
Is that what you're sayin'? No.
No, I'm not sayin' that.
There should be a full accounting here, right? Top to bottom.
Am I right? No.
I mean, yes.
The inventory is correct.
Good.
But not so good, too.
You see, what's in here isn't in there.
You're two handguns short.
Do you know where they are? No.
I [Sighs.]
That's disappointing, Rick.
I thought that we had an understanding.
But this -- well, this shows that someone's not on board, and I can't have that.
I don't enjoy killing women.
Men -- I can waste them all the live long.
But at the end of the day, Olivia, my dear, this was your responsibility.
-Look, we can work this out.
-Oh, yes, we can.
And I'm going to -- right now.
[Whimpering.]
This was your job, and you screwed up.
Keeping track of guns? [Whimpers.]
That shit is life and death.
I thought about hiding some of the guns.
I did it before.
I figured I could bury some out there.
Maybe we don't touch them for years.
Years? Yeah.
That's right.
But what if the Saviors find those guns? What if we run into them when we have those guns on us? One of us dies.
Maybe more than that.
Maybe a lot more.
Doesn't matter how many bullets we have.
It isn't enough.
They win.
It's that black-and-white.
Hiding a couple of guns isn't the answer, not anymore.
We don't have to like it, but we need to give them over.
A Glock 9 and a .
22.
That's what they're looking for.
Who has it? Someone knows where they are or they know who does.
If we don't find them, they're gonna kill Olivia.
They'll do it.
Why do they care? Two guns aren't a threat to them.
But those guns could help protect us from whatever else is out there.
Do you have 'em? Wish I did.
Rick: Most of you weren't there.
You didn't have to watch.
But you can look away now when someone else dies, or you can help solve this.
We give them what they want, and we live in peace.
[Speaking in hushed voice.]
Don't.
Now is not the time.
[Speaking in hushed voice.]
It is.
Say we find the guns.
How are we gonna get out of this, Rick? There is no way out of this.
Let me put this to all of you as clearly as I can.
I'm not in charge anymore.
Negan is.
Now, who has the guns? Not everyone's here.
[Suspenseful music plays.]
[Walkers growling.]
Spencer: Rosita! Where are you?! [Growling intensifies.]
[Grunts.]
[Growling continues.]
[Growling.]
[Grunting.]
[Groans.]
[Panting.]
[Spits.]
Rosita! So that's why you're out here? They killed Denise.
[Speaks Spanish.]
It's empty.
So what if it was full? What could you do with it? Don't you get it? That asshole back there took our guns because he's gonna take all our guns.
What? What are you gonna do, tell them? [Scoffs.]
This is not our life.
[Floorboard creaks.]
[Low-key ominous music plays.]
[Sighs shakily.]
Father Gabriel: Nothing.
Still.
I just I feel like I know this is going to work out.
How? We'll find the guns.
We'll get through today.
Then we'll find a way to go forward, how to beat this.
There is no beating this.
Yes, there is, somehow.
I have faith in us.
I have faith in you.
Things change.
You're my friend.
It wasn't always that way.
Where's Michonne? Could she possibly have -- She doesn't have anything they're lookin' for.
What you did with the graves, it was quick thinkin'.
Thank you.
It was nice digging a grave I knew would stay empty.
No luck? We searched the house, Rosita's.
There's nothing.
So what do we do now? If they were anywhere, they'd be here.
Spencer's done this kind of thing before.
We keep looking.
Maybe today works out.
I'll check the garage.
I'll look in Deanna's office again.
[Sighs.]
[Floorboard creaks.]
[Door opens, closes.]
Man: Balloons? You going to a party, little girl? Can I keep them, please? [Bird chirps.]
It's just Let me keep them.
Say please again, little girl.
Please.
Yeah.
One more time.
[Chuckles lasciviously.]
[Sharply.]
Please.
Be careful, little girl.
They'll be gone soon.
[Indistinct conversations in distance.]
What you got for me, Rick? [Breathes deeply.]
[Chuckles.]
Well, would you look at that? They were here after all.
Funny how a little "Holy shit! Somebody's gonna die!" lights a fire under everybody's ass! [Olivia whimpering.]
So, tell me, Rick -- which one of your fine folks almost cost Olivia the rest of her days? -It doesn't matter anymore.
-No, it matters.
See, you need to get everybody on board.
Everybody.
Or we just go right back to square one.
[Door rattles, slams.]
[Brakes squeal.]
[Engine idling.]
[Ominous music plays.]
[Engine shuts off.]
[Brakes squeal, engine shuts off.]
Hell of a place you got here, Rick.
Give me a second.
No.
Please, can you just give me a second? He had me hold it.
I need the rifle.
What? I know it's in the bag.
I know what you're doing out there.
What am I doing out there? You're practicing.
We have to give up our guns, all of them.
We can't.
If you keep it, and they find it, someone dies.
I'm not losing you or Carl or anyone else.
[Emotionally.]
I'm not losing anyone else! Now I'm giving it to them.
Are you gonna let me? [Humming.]
Look at this! Rick: I thought she was scavenging.
She was hunting.
This one never came inside.
We kept it near the line.
Look at this.
This is something to build a relationship on.
Good for you, Rick.
This is readin' the room and gettin' the message.
I've said it before, I'm gonna say it again.
You, sirare special.
Now that you know we can follow your rules [Unctuously.]
Yes? I'd like to ask you if Daryl can stay.
Not happenin'.
You know what? I don't know.
Maybe Daryl can plead his case.
Maybe Daryl can sway me.
Daryl? [Chuckles.]
Well, you tried.
Now what you got to do is get over that tall wall of yours and try harder out there.
Earn for me.
Because we're coming back soon, and when we do, you better have something interesting for us, or Lucille, she's gonna have her way.
I want you to hear that again.
If you don't have something interesting for us somebody's gonna die.
And no more magic guns.
Arat, grab that deer.
It's getting late.
Let's go home.
[Carcass thuds.]
Man, I love a gal that buys me dinner and doesn't expect me to put out.
[Chuckles.]
I'll take that.
Rosita! Got a little thank-you.
That's all you're getting back.
Took all your guns, most of your beds.
I hope you find a place to lay your pretty little head.
[Chuckles.]
Did you find anything else out there? Just your dead friends.
[Chuckles.]
[Engine starts, revs.]
[Engine idling.]
You can have it back.
Just say the word.
[Engine revving.]
So, nobody died.
And you know what I think? I think you and I, we've refined our understanding.
Let me ask you something, Rick.
Do you want me to go? I think that'd be good.
Then just say those two magical words.
Thank you.
[Chuckles.]
Don't be ridiculous.
Thank you.
[Walker growling in distance.]
Another one.
[Growling continues.]
You need our help.
Davey, hand me that candlestick over there.
You know what I think, Rick? I think we're both gonna come out of this winners.
Watch my form! [Walker growling.]
[Splat! Guts squishing.]
Ahh.
Yep.
Win-win.
[Candlestick clatters.]
You should clean that up for me for next time.
Let's move out! Oh, wait.
[Chuckles.]
How careless of me.
You didn't think I was gonna leave Lucille, did ya? I mean, after what she did, why would you want 'er? Thank you for being so accommodating, friend.
In case you haven't caught on I just slipped my dick down your throat, and you thanked me for it.
[Engine starts.]
[Soft music plays.]
[Gate creaks.]
Rick: Spencer.
We took the guns you had in your house.
The Saviors wanted ours, all of them.
There were two missing from the inventory.
They were gonna kill Olivia.
Spencer.
You went into my house? They were gonna kill Olivia.
Look, I'm not faulting you for having the guns.
I did it myself.
But the food and liquor? [Sighs.]
That's 'cause you're small, Spencer.
You're weak.
You got lucky with the walls.
You got lucky with us.
We should've made a deal with them when we could've.
Oh, yeah, we're so lucky.
You've led us all to the Promised Land! Isn't that right, Rick?! Here we are! I guess Glenn and Abraham were lucky, too? You say anything like that again to me, I'll break your jaw, knock your teeth out.
You understand? Say yes.
Yes.
[Vehicle door slams.]
You had guns? Uh-huh.
Why didn't you tell me after I -- You saw what I did to get one, that I need bullets.
I had them for a while because I didn't trust Rick.
'Cause I was worried about him being in charge.
You know what? You were right.
This doesn't have to be our life.
[Engine starts.]
[Vehicle drives off.]
They took our mattresses -- most of them.
That rifle was one of theirs from the outpost.
They didn't have a list? Unh-unh.
Could've hidden more.
Did you? [Sighs.]
No.
Everything we have, we got from fighting.
I made the choice.
There aren't enough of us.
It's about numbers.
There's the Hilltop.
They'd still have the numbers.
We play by their rules, and we get some kind of life.
[Emotionally.]
What kind of a life? [Sighs.]
You know, I had a friend.
I don't talk about him.
He was my partner.
He got Lori and Carl to safety right after it all started.
I couldn't.
I was in the hospital.
I-I didn't know what was happenin'.
My friend His name was Shane.
Well, him and Lori they were together.
They thought I was dead.
I know Judith isn't mine.
I know it.
[Breathes deeply.]
I love her.
She's my daughter.
But she isn't mine.
I had to accept that.
I did.
So I could keep her alive.
I'll die before she does, and I hope that's a long time from now so I can raise her and protect her and teach her how to survive.
This is how we live now.
I had to accept that, too, so I could keep everyone else alive.
It's not your fault when people die.
Not always, but sometimes -- sometimes it is.
You have to accept this -- all of us do -- or it won't work.
I'm gonna try.
[Insect buzzing.]
