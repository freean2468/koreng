" (screaming in pain) (Rick) Get the doctor at the hilltop.
He's gonna make things better.
We're gonna get there.
You gotta route? Yeah.
There are two more routes north from here.
They're probably waiting for us right now.
Go back.
Where? Hi, I'm Negan.
I don't wanna kill you people.
I want you to work for me.
But you killed my people.
For that, you're gonna pay.
I'm gonna beat the holy hell outta one of you.
[Breathing heavily.]
Negan: What? Was the joke that bad? I'm gonna kill you.
What? I didn't quite catch that.
You're gonna have to speak up.
[Sniffles.]
Not today not tomorrow but I'm gonna kill you.
[Inhales sharply.]
Jesus.
[Chuckles softly.]
Simon what did he have, a knife? Simon: Uh, he had a hatchet.
A hatchet? He had an ax.
[Chuckles.]
Simon's my right-hand man.
Having one of those is important.
I mean, what do you have left without them? A whole lot of work.
Do you have one? Maybe one of these fine people still breathing? Oh.
Or did I [Clicks tongue.]
[Sighs.]
Sure.
Yeah.
Give me his ax.
[Footsteps.]

Are you kiddin' me? Did you see what just happened, what I just did? You just [Sighs.]
[Scoffs.]
Your best chance is to stand up, grab that ax, and drive it through the back of my head.
See how you do.
Keep actin' tough.
Go ahead.

[Grunts.]

[Walkers growling.]
Not anymore.
Think about what happened.
[Walkers growling.]
Negan: [Echoing.]
I simply cannot decide.
[Chuckles.]
Negan: I got an idea.
Eenie meenie miney mo catch a tiger by his toe.
If he hollers let him go.
My mother told me to pick the very best one and you are it.
Negan: Anybody moves, anybody says anything, cut the boy's other eye out and feed it to his father, and then we'll start.
You can breathe.
You can blink.
You can cry.
Hell, you're all gonna be doing that.
[Thud echoes.]
Oh! Look at that! Taking it like a champ! Suck my nuts.

[Breathing shakily.]
Take a damn look! [Grunting.]
Rick: Daryl! No! Oh, no.
[Chuckles.]
That? Oh, my! That is a no-no.
The whole thing -- not one bit of that shit flies here.
[Woman crying.]
Do you want me to do it? Right here.
[Grunting.]
No.
No, you don't kill them not until you try a little.
[Grunting.]
And anyway that's not how it works.
Now, I already told you people -- first one's free, then -- what'd I say? I said I would shut that shit down! No exceptions.
Now, I don't know what kind of lying assholes you've been dealing with but I'm a man of my word.
First impressions are important.
I need you to know me.
So back to it.
[All gasping.]
Woman: No! [Groaning, gasping.]
[Walkers growling.]
Buddy, you still there? [Grunting, sputtering.]
I just don't know.
It seems like you're trying to speak, but you just took a hell of a hit.
I just popped your skull so hard, your eyeball just popped out, and it is gross as shit! Maggie, I'll find you.
[Sobbing.]
[Grunting.]
Oh.
Oh, hell.
I can see this is hard on you guys.
[Grunting continues.]
I am sorry.
I truly am.
But I did say it.
No exceptions! [Grunts.]
[Walkers groing.]

[Thudding, squelching.]
[All sobbing.]
[Walkers growling.]

Lucille is thirsty.
[Laughs.]
She is a vampire bat.
[Sobbing continues.]
[Breathing shakily.]
Negan: What? Was the joke that bad? [Thumping.]
[Walkers growling.]
Negan: People died, Rick.
It's what happened.
Doesn't mean the rest of them have to.
[Growling continues.]
Get me my ax.
Get memyax! [Walkers growling.]
Negan: I thought you were the guy, Rick.
Maybe you're not.
We'll give it one more go.
Now, I really want you to try this time.
Last chance.
Bring me my ax! [Gunshots.]
[Growling continues.]
[Growling.]
[Groaning.]
[Growling.]
Aah! Aah! Aah! [Growling continues.]
[Gunfire.]
Aah! [Gunfire continues.]
Clock is ticking, Rick! Think about what can still happen.
[Grunts.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Growls.]
[Grunts.]
[Sighs heavily.]
[Growling.]
[Horn honking.]
[Grunting.]
[Grunting.]
[Grunts.]
[Grunting.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Rick breathing heavily.]
Attaboy! [Walkers growling.]
[Breathing heavily.]
[Growling fades.]
[Engine starts.]
[Brakes squeal.]
[Engine stops.]
[Keys jingling.]
[Claps hands.]
We're here, prick.
[Scoffs.]
This must be hard for you, right? I mean, you have been King Shit for so long.
Losin' two of your own like [Snaps fingers.]
Gettin' 'em clipped like that, one nut, then the other, and in front of your boy? That is some screwed-up shit! Ah.
Oh.
Goody.
[Cap clatters.]
[Sighs.]
You were in charge.
Negan: [Grunts.]
Hell you were probably addic7ed to it.
And now, well, clip, clip -- that's over.
But you can still lead a nice, productive life producing for me.
I think you're gonna need it.
I just got a feelin'.
[Sighs.]
So take it.
[Breathing heavily.]
Here we are.
Let me ask you something, Rick -- do you even know what that little trip was about? Negan: Speak when you're spoken to.
[Breathing heavily.]
Okay.
Okay.
That trip was about the way that you looked at me.
I wanted to change that.
I wanted you to understand.
But you're still looking at me the same damn way like I shit in your scrambled eggs, and that's not gonna work.
So do I give you another chance? [Breathing raggedly.]
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
[Chuckling.]
All right.
And here it is -- the grand-prize game.
What you do next will decide whether your crap day becomes everyone's last crap day or just another crap day.
Get some guns to the back of their heads.
[Guns cocking.]
Good.
Now level with their noses, so if you have to fire [imitates explosion.]
it'll be a real mess.
Kid Right here.
Kidnow.
You a southpaw? Am I a what? You a lefty? No.
Good.
That hurt? No.
Should.
It's supposed to.
All right.
Get down on the ground, kid, next to Daddy.
Spread them wings.
Simon you got a pen? Yeah.
[Grunts.]
Sorry, kid.
This is gonna be as cold as a warlock's ballsack, just like he was hanging his ballsack above you and dragging it right across the forearm.
There you go.
Gives you a little leverage.
Please.
Please.
Please don't.
Please don't.
Me? [Chuckles.]
I ain't doing shit.
Ahh.
Rick, I want you to take your ax cut your son's left arm off, right on that line.
Now, I know -- I know.
You're gonna have to process that for a second.
That makes sense.
Still, though, I'm gonna need you to do it, or all these people are gonna die.
Then Carl dies, then the people back home die and then you, eventually.
I'm gonna keep you breathing for a few years, just so you can stew on it.
Michonne: You -- You don't have to do this.
We understand.
We understand.
You understand.
Yeah.
I'm not sure that Rick does.
I'm gonna need a clean cut right there on that line.
Now, I know this is a screwed-up thing to ask, but it's gonna have to be like a salami slice -- nothing messy, clean, 45 degrees -- give us something to fold over.
We got a great doctor.
The kid'll be fine.
Probably.
Rick this needs to happen now -- chop, chop -- or I will crush the little fella's skull myself.
It can -- It can -- It can be me.
It can be me.
W-W-- [Sniffles.]
Y-You can do it to me.
I c-- I can go with -- with you.
No.
This is the only way.
Rick pick up the ax.
Not making a decision is a big decision.
You really want to see all these people die? You will.
You will see every ugly thing.
Oh, my God.
â[Groans.]
Are you gonna make me count? Okay, Rick.
You win.
I am counting.
3! âPlease.
[Crying.]
Please.
[Gasping.]
It can be me.
Please! [Crying.]
2! Please, don't do -- [Sobbing.]
[Dramatic music plays.]
This is it.
Aaah! â[Sobbing.]
[Sobs.]
Dad just do it.
Just do it.
[Sobbing.]
[Sobbing.]
Rick.
[Breathing heavily.]
You answer to me.
You provide for me.
You belong to me.
Right? Speak when you're spoken to! You answer to me.
You provide for me.
Provide for you.
You belong to me, right?! [Breathing heavily.]
Right.
Right.
That is the look I wanted to see.
We did it all of us, together even the dead guys on the ground.
Hell, they get the spirit award, for sure.
[Sighs.]
Today was a productive damn day! [Sighs.]
Now, I hope, for all your sake that you get it now that you understand how things work.
Things have changed.
Whatev you had going for you that is [Chuckling.]
over now.
Ah.
Dwight load him up.
[Vehicle doors close.]
He's got guts -- not a little bitch like someone I know.
I like him.
He's mine now.
But you still want to try something? "Not today, not tomorrow.
" "Not today, not tomorrow"? I will cut pieces off of Hell's his name? Daryl.
Wow.
[Chuckles.]
That actually sounds right.
I will cut pieces off of Daryl and put them on your doorstep -- or, better yet, I will bring him to you and have you do it for me.
[Chuckles.]
Ahh! Welcome to a brand-new beginning, you sorry shits! I'm gonna leave you a truck.
Keep it.
Use it to cart all the crap you're gonna find me.
We'll be back for our first offering in one week.
Until then ta-ta.
[Insects chirping.]
Rick: Maggie.
Maggie.
[Sobs.]
Maggie you need to sit down.
Maggie.
No.
We need to get you to the Hilltop.
You need to go get ready.
For what? To fight them.
They have Daryl.
They have an army.
[Breathing heavily.]
We would die -- all of us.
Go home.
[Voice breaking.]
Take everybody with you.
I can get there by myself.
You can barely stand up.
I need to go.
You need to go to Alexandria.
[Breathing heavily.]
You were out -- out here for me.
We still are.
[Sobbing.]
I can make it now.
I need you to go back.
I can't have you out here.
I can't have you all out here anymore.
I need you to go back.
Maggie we're not letting you go.
Okay? You have to.
[Sighs.]
It's not gonna happen.
[Breathing heavily.]
I'm taking her.
I'm gonna get her there.
I'm gonna keep her safe.
I'm not giving you a choice.
I'm taking him with me.
[Groans.]
I'm gonna take him.
[Voice breaking.]
That's what I'm gonna do.
[Sniffles.]
[Exhales sharply.]
[Breathing heavily.]
I need to do this.
Please.
We need to help you.
I got it.
I got it.
No.
No.
Pl-- Pl-- Please let us.
He-- He's our family, t-- He's our family, too.
[Sobbing.]
You're okay.
All right.
On three.
1, 2 [Sobbing continues.]
Yeah.
Negan: Bet you thought you were all gonna grow old together, sittin' around the table at Sunday dinner and the happily ever after.
No.
Doesn't work like that, Rick.
Not anymore.
[Slow music plays.]
[Growling.]
[Engine starts.]
[Music continues.]
[Growling continues.]
