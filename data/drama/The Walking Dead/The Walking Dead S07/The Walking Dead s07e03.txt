" I'm sorry.

You got something to say to me? I shoulda killed ya.
Yeah, you probably should've.

You want me to do it? Welcome to a brand new beginning, you sorry shit.
[The Jam's "Town Called Malice" plays.]
Better stop dreaming of the quiet life 'Cause it's the one we'll never know And quit running for that runaway bus 'Cause those rosy days are few And stop apologizing for the things you've never done 'Cause time is short and life is cruel But it's up to us to change This town called Malice Rows and rows of disused milk Stand dying in the dairy yard And a hundred lonely housewives Clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts Hanging out their old love letters On the line to dry It's enough to make you stop believing When tears come fast and furious In a town called Malice Yeah-eah-eah Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-da-ba Ba, ba, ba-da-ba Oh, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-da-ba Ba, ba, ba-da-ba Struggle after struggle Year after year The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice I'm almost stone-cold dead In a town called Malice Ooh-ooh, yeah A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef Gets dashed against the co-op To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear It's a big decision in a town called Malice Ooh-ooh, yeah Ooh [Walkers growling.]

Well, maybe next time.

Still getting used to being my own assistant.
Whatever they say just do it.

Okay, let's take a look.
[Door closes.]
It'll get better -- if you let it.
Negan will take care of you.

Go about your business.
Except for you.
You, stand right there.
Sit.

Man: Coming.

And you? You are hustling.
It's working.
It's working slow, but, hey, man, some people are harder to break than others.
Yeah.
He's close.
Yeah, he is.
Since you're doing such an awesome job, you want to have a little blast from the past with you-know-who? [Chuckles.]
I'm kidding, man.
Lighten up.
Pick whoever you want, as long as she says yes.
Oh, crap.
Are you okay down there? Your penis? I mean, that guy, he, uh clomped on it.
Or is it pckww? Down for the count? [Chuckles.]
I'm fine.
But I'm gonna pass.
Man, I'm cool.
Huh.
Are you cool, though, Dwight? I mean, I just said that it was happy hour at the Pussy Bar and Dwight eats for free, and you're telling me no? Is that cool? I haven't finished the job.
I-I haven't earned it yet.
Right? The hell you talking about? You earn what you take.
[Walkie-talkie clicks.]
Woman: We have an orange situation.
Give me that.
Arat, what do you got? Grab-a-go? Yeah, he could've only gone three ways -- the moth, the angel, or the hard way.
Good.
It's D.
I'll meet you at the gate.
I mean, I want my shit back, but that is grunt work.
Why don't you have Fat Joey go and do it? God knows he needs the exercise.
You? You don't have to do it, Dwight.
I'd like to do it.
[ Chuckles .]
Good boy.
[Engine shuts off.]
[Upbeat music playing.]
Let's have a moment in the sun [Lock clicks.]
The magic's only just begun It's time to have a little fun We want everybody to come and see why you should be On Easy Street Yeah, we got a front-row seat Oh, to a life that can't be beat Right here on Easy Street 'Cause the world is but a treat When you're on Easy Street 'Cause the world is but a treat When you're on Easy Street [Upbeat music plays.]
We're on Easy Street And it feels so sweet 'Cause the world is but a treat When you're on Easy Street And we're breaking out the good champagne I'm sittin' pretty on a gravy train [Muffled.]
It's time to have a little fun We want everybody to come and see why you should be On Easy Street Yeah, we got a front-row seat Oh, to a life that can't be beat Right here on Easy Street [Door opens.]
[Footsteps approaching.]
[Walker growling.]
[Walker growling.]
[Walker growling.]
[Bones crunch.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Kickstand creaks.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Growling.]
[Grunting.]
[Breathing heavily.]
Go back while you can.
You know I did.
Whatever he's done to you, there's more.
There's always more.
You won't get away.
And when you're back, it'll be worse.
[Negan whistling.]
[Chuckles.]
[Sighs.]
Are we pissing our pants yet? Who are you? Negan.
Who are you? Negan.
Who are you? Negan.
Negan.
[Chuckles.]
You see that? I am everywhere.
And this was your shot to prove to me that that fundamental fact was sinking in, and you failed.
Which sucks, because your life was about to get so much cooler.
Am I right? Damn right.
[Chuckles.]
Now, Dwight gave you some options.
I don't think you get it yet.
So I'm gonna break it down for you.
You get three choices.
One, you wind up on the spike and you work for me as a dead man.
Two, you get out of your cell, you work for points, but you're gonna wish you were dead.
Or three, you work for me, you get yourself a brand-new pair of shoes, and you live like a king! Choice seems pretty obvious.
You should know, there is no door number four.
This is it.
This is the only way.
[Chuckles.]
Screw it.
Wow! You don't scare easy.
I love that.
But Lucille Well, it kind of pisses her off.
She finds it to be disrespectful.
Lucky for you, she's not feeling too thirsty today.
But I am.
So I'm gonna go get me a drink! [Chuckles.]
[Whistling.]
[Walker growling.]
[Walker growling.]
[Growling.]
[Grunting.]
Sherry: Daryl? There's so many things I wish I never found out I wish I didn't try Back in the woods after I lost Tina when we took your stuff, when we decided to go back I told you I was sorry.
And you said, "You're gonna be.
" I am.
[Footsteps departing.]
I'm screwed up.
My bike's screwed up, and you're going back because you owe.
And now you owe a hell of a lot more.
Was it worth it? Just let me go.
I can't.
Why? Shut up.
We used to be friendly.
Shut up.
After everything he did to you, to your wife Don't talk about her.
She's not my wife.
Not anymore.
Look, there's nowhere to go.
Everything's his or will be.
I know.
Keep walking.
I said keep walking! It's okay.
What? It's okay if you do it.
I get it.
Hell, I want you to.
Please.
Shut up.
Keep walking.
I can't go back.
You will.
'Cause that's the only way.
See, that's what he tells us.
That there's no choice, no way but his way.
Thug swoops in with a baseball bat and a smile, and we're all so scared that we gave up everything.
Well, there's only one of him and all of us, so why are we living like this? Because look where we are! We were losing.
Now we're not.
[Scoffs.]
You know after me and Maria survived those first few months when we got there we thought it would be okay.
We thought we knew how to fight the monsters.
Get up.
It's okay, D.
Get up! There's nothing back there for me.
This is the last time I'm going to kneel.
Get up! You feel.
Get up I remember, D.
or I'll put every person you ever talked to on the fence.
I'll blindfold them, and I'll make them eat shit sandwiches for the rest of their short, sorry lives.
I'll dig up your dead wife and feed her body to the crows.
You feel that? You feel it?! Okay, D.
You won.
But you know there's nothing left.
[Gunshot, body thuds.]
[Door opens, closes.]
Can I have one? [Lighter clicks.]
[Sighs.]
He good to you? Yeah.
Good.
Are you, um -- [Clears throat.]
You happy? Yeah.
That's good.
I did the right thing.
It's a hell of a lot better than being dead.
Yeah.
[Upbeat music plays.]
Let's have a moment in the sun [Music shuts off.]
[Lock clicks, door opens.]
Eat.
You got your friend killed.
I got Tina killed.
And don't pretend like you don't know the score.
You should be dead.
But Negan's taken a shine to you.
You're lucky.
Don't forget.
Bon appetit.
[Door closes, lock clicks.]
I was all right For a while I could smile for a while But I saw you last night You held my hand so tight As you stopped to say hello Oh, you wished me well You couldn't tell That I'd been crying over you Crying over you When you said, "So long" Left me standing all alone Alone and crying [Crying.]
Crying Crying Crying It's hard to understand But the touch of your hand Can start me crying I thought that I Was over you But it's true, so true [Lock clicks, door opens.]
Dwight: Step in.
[Chuckles.]
Ahh.
Jesus.
You look awful.
Don't you worry.
We'll have Carson fix you all up.
You thirsty? Here.
Ah, hell, I forgot.
Your mouth is all puffed up like a baboon's ass.
Need a straw? D, give him a straw.
What's wrong with you? See that guy? He hustles.
I like hustle.
But believe it or not, things weren't always cool between us.
See, D here -- he worked for points, him and his super hot wife and her super hot sister.
But, see, sis -- she needed meds.
And that shit is hard to scavenge, so it cost more.
Sis fell behind on points, so I asked her to marry me.
Told her I would take care of her in sickness and in health, blah blah blah, because I am a stand-up guy.
She tells me that she's gonna think about it.
Next thing you know, I'm dealing with an orange situation.
Dwighty boy here stole all the medication and took off with his super hot wife and my super hot maybe soon-to-be fiancÃ©e.
[Lucille taps.]
So I had to send my guys after him.
Because I can't let something like that stand.
Therearerules.
Cost me an arm and a leg going after him.
And you know what -- Dwighty boy? [Chuckles.]
He still got away.
But here's the thing.
D -- he saw the light.
He manned up.
He came back.
He asked for my forgiveness.
I like that.
Made me take notice.
But Lucille Wellyou know how she is.
She is a stickler for the rules.
So, Dwight he begged me not to kill Sherry, which I thought was kind of cute, so I was just gonna kill him.
But then Sherry says that she will marry me if I let Dwight live, which, if you think about it, that's a pretty screwed-up deal, 'cause I was gonna marry her sister until she wound up dead, but Sherry is super hot.
Anyways, it was a start.
But it wasn't enough.
So Dwight he got the iron.
And then I married his super hot wife.
Ex-wife.
And then after all that, he still got on board.
And now look at him.
Pow! One of my top guys.
And we are totally cool.
The point being, I think you can be that guy.
I think you are ready to be that guy.
You look around here.
This? Well it can all be yours.
All you got to do is answer one simple question.
Who are you? [Chuckles.]
What, does the cat got your tongue? You're just overwhelmed by the awesomeness of this? I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Who are you? Daryl.
Oh.
This is the only -- Hey.
Sst, sst, sst.
It's cool, D.
He made his choice.
Ain't my problem if he made a dumbass choice.
[Grunts.]
You're gonna wind up in that room or hanging on the fence! Daryl: I get why you did it.
Why you took it.
You were thinking about someone else.
That's why I can't.
[Walkers growling.]
[Bottle shatters.]
[Sighs.]
