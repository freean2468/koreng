1 (announcer) Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead.
" I can't believe he would just take our stuff and go.
He obviously doesn't wanna be found.
(Rick) Yes, he does.
We came to ask you to join us in fighting the Saviors.
People will die, and not just the Saviors.
I offer our friend Daryl asylum.
He will be safe here.
It's time to fight.
No this is something I am not a part of.
(grunting) Gavin, tell your man to stop.
(grunting) [Walker growling.]
Diane.
Got it.
[Growling continues.]
[Growling stops.]
Man: Good shot.
My sister had that dress.
Don't think about it.
[Vehicles approaching.]
Nice.
[Sighs.]
It's getting to be like clockwork.
Now, boss? Yes, Jerry.
It looks light.
Perhaps you might look again, Gavin.
We've met our obligations.
Huh.
You're right.
Doesn't seem like much, but 8, 9, 10.
You're right.
Jared: I want his gun.
In fact, I don't think this asshole should have a gun ever.
No guns for bad boys.
You hit me first, prick.
[Chuckles.]
[Guns cock.]
What's that? Gavin: Okay.
Where do we go from here? That's right, Your Majesty.
Where do we go from here? Hand him your weapon, Richard.
Stand down, idiot.
Suck on it, you little shit.
Richard! [Grunts.]
Aah! [Grunts.]
[Grunting.]
Gavin: Stand down! [Grunts.]
Gavin: Ezekiel, you know I can't have this.
Ezekiel: We can't have this.
Richard will refrain from attending our future exchanges.
No.
No, Ezekiel, you're gonna keep bringing him.
'Cause if this doesn't stop, if this starts becoming a real problem, you remember what I said.
He is still batting first on the lineup.
Almost did it myself just now.
Hey.
I know it's not his fault, but this has got to stop.
So things might need to get a little visceral.
Jared, get the hell up! Let's get the hell out of here.
Can I, um Can I have my stick back, please? Someone gave it to me.
Someone who's gone.
Gavin, you got to let me turn up this dipshit.
No! No! Just read the goddamn room, sensei.
Let's go.
[Car doors opening.]
[Car doors closing.]
[Engines start.]
[Brakes squeal.]
Yeah.
My sister loved that dress.
[Truck door closes.]
You were quick with that today.
Impressive, Benjamin.
Told you I'm getting better.
You were a trifle too quick.
Just because you now know how to fight doesn't mean you should seek one.
Yeah, but it just happened.
I wasn't thinking.
You have to.
Every time from this time forward, so you shall.
Yes? Yes.
[Truck door closes.]
Richard.
We shall speak later.
Jerry.
You're sick with this stick, man.
Ezekiel: Jerry! Hey, uh, do you want to head to the infirmary? No.
I'm okay.
Daryl: Hey.
Where'd you go in them trucks? I need to speak to Daryl alone.
That okay? Yeah, I'll get you something for that cut.
Yeah.
You went to see them, right? Yeah.
Part of your deal? What the hell's wrong with you? You're bleeding.
They did that to you.
You know what they are.
I do.
You know, if Carol were here, she saw all that if she knew about Abraham and Glenn she'd be leading us right to them, ready to kill them all.
She would.
And that's why she left, man.
[Scoffs.]
[Horse neighs in distance.]
I'm practicing.
Gonna have to start using these more.
The Saviors are smart enough to know I shouldn't have a gun around them.
Morgan said you're a bowman.
Why? 'Cause we want the same things.
I need your help.
Richard: We need something to move Ezekiel.
This is it.
Alexandria, the Hilltop, and the Kingdom hitting first, hitting hard, and then we wipe the Saviors from the Earth.
Keeping people -- dozens and dozens and dozens of good people keeping them safe.
They ride this road.
If we see cars, it's the Saviors.
They've been coming in packs of two or three lately.
That's why I need you.
I can't take them alone.
We're gonna hit them with the guns first and then the Molotovs.
Then back to the guns until they're dead.
Why the fire? Needs to look bad.
The Saviors who discover what's left we want them to be angry.
I left a trail from here to the weapons cache I planted, to the cabin of that someone Ezekiel cares about.
Who's that? It's just some loner he met.
Sometimes he brings food.
Why don't they live in the Kingdom? I don't know.
She lives out there, she'll die out there.
It's a woman? What does that matter? She's got more balls than you and me.
She's gonna die either way.
When the Saviors come and find their buddies dead, if they know their elbow from their asshole and can follow an obvious spoor, they're gonna go to the weapons cache and then to the cabin, and they're gonna attack this woman.
What's her name? Maybe they kill her, maybe they don't, but it's gonna show Ezekiel what he needs to do.
Her name.
What is it? She's tough.
Maybe she'll live.
Say her damn name! [Sighs.]
Carol.
I hoped you didn't know her, but I didn't think you'd care, 'cause you know what needs to happen.
No.
Maybe she'll live.
Look, this -- this is how -- this is how this could happen.
This is how we can get rid of the Saviors, how we all can have a future.
She's living out there on her own, just waiting to die.
No! If we don't do anything, a hell of a lot more people are gonna die, people who want to live! You stay the hell away from Carol, you hear me? [Vehicles approaching.]
It's them.
Look, we can wait for things to go bad, we lose people or we can do the hard thing and choose our fate for ourselves.
No.
Sorry.
[Both grunting.]
[Breathing heavily.]
[Panting.]
There'll be more.
Or those -- they're gonna ride back this way later.
We'll have another chance.
But we're running out of time.
If you and your people want to move against the Saviors you need to do it soon, and you need the Kingdom.
What we have to do requires sacrifice one way or another.
Guys like us we've already lost so much.
You don't know me.
I know that Carol, living on her own like that she might as well be dead right now.
She gets hurt, she dies, if she catches a fever, if she's taken out by a walker if she gets hit by lightning -- anything -- anything happens to her, I'll kill you.
I would die for the Kingdom.
Why don't you? Woman: Are you a collective, or does one lead? This.
Hi.
I'm Rick.
We own your lives.
You want to buy them back? Have anything? Well, you have one of my people.
Gabriel.
I want to see him first.
Then we can talk.
The boat things you took got taken.
Saw them, so we took the rest.
And we took him.
Well, then you know we have nothing to buy back our lives with.
That's what you'll have soon -- nothing.
Because me and my people already belong to that group who took those supplies from the boat.
They're called the Saviors.
They own our lives.
And if you kill us, he'll be taking something from them.
And they will come looking.
You only have two options when it comes to the Saviors -- either they kill you or they own you.
But there is a way out.
Join us.
Join us in fighting them.
No.
[Grunts.]
Rosita, don't! [Grunting.]
Everybody, stop! Just wait! Gabriel: Let us go, or I will kill her! Away from Tamiel now.
The Saviors, they -- they have other places, other communities.
They have things -- food, weapons, vehicles, fuel.
Whatever you want, the Saviors have it.
Away from Tamiel.
Your words now.
If you join us and we beat them together, you can have much of what's theirs.
Fighting with us, you'll be rewarded, more than you can imagine.
Want something now.
Rick can do anything.
This group? They found me -- here, so far from our home.
What do you need? Just tell us -- we'll get it for you.
We'll show you what we can do.
Now.
[Wind whistling.]
Tamiel, Brion show Rick Up Up Up.
It's okay.
Here.
Sit.
Thanks.
I'm okay.
Who are these people? [Clatters.]
New best friends, I guess? Where are they taking him? All of us, here since the change.
We take.
We don't bother.
Things grow harder.
We open cans, sometimes inside's rotten.
Time's passed.
Things are changing again.
So maybe we change.
Maybe.
Need to know you're real with this, that you're worth it.
Unh! Michonne: What did you do?! [Breathing heavily.]
[Panting.]
[Grunts.]
Michonne: Rick! I'm all right.
[Clattering.]
[Walker growling.]
[Growling continues.]
Rick! [Grunting.]
Aah! Aah! [Groans.]
[Growling continues.]
[Groans.]
Aah! Michonne: The walls! Use them! [Growling continues.]
[Growling continues.]
[Grunting.]
[Walker gurgling.]
[Walker gasping.]
[Breathing heavily.]
You believe us now?! Just tell us what you want and we'll get it.
[Clatters.]
[Panting.]
[Grunting.]
[Panting.]
Guns.
A lot.
A lot.
And then we fight your fight.
[Chuckling.]
You know we will win? Oh, I know it.
After, we get half of what's won.
Oh, you'll get a third.
And we're taking back what you just stole from us.
Half.
A third.
Half.
[Chuckles.]
A third.
A third, and we keep what we stole.
[Chuckles.]
Half of the jars, the ones we took.
One time, this time.
Yes? Say yes.
Yes.
And the guns.
[Chuckles.]
And the guns.
Waited by the boat long time.
Want something for it.
So it's this.
Jars and guns, guns and jars.
You waited for someone to get the supplies off that boat for you? Long time.
We take.
We don't bother.
You had that thing down there for someone to prove themselves? No.
His name was Winslow.
What were you gonna do with Gabriel? Go.
Deal expires.
Soon.
What's your name? Jadis.
[Wind whistling.]
We have a deal.
[Door creaks.]
I told Richard no more visits.
Ezekiel: I am aware.
Your desire is solitude.
That's what I've ordered to be facilitated.
My men are here clearing the wasted.
The dead are quite inconsiderate when it comes to those who are wanting to be alone.
I thought our efforts would be quiet enough to fall beneath your notice.
You're the one who opened the door.
Tripped my wire.
Thought I caught it in time.
Sorry.
You hid them well, lady.
Don't call her "lady.
" Ma'am, Ms.
, missus You can shut up now.
Copy.
Goodbye, Your Majesty.
Jerry: Hold up.
Cobbler.
Kevin said you like it.
Just in case you did open the door.
Go.
[Door closes.]
[Sighs.]
[Knock on door.]
[Sighs.]
[Sniffles.]
Okay.
Oh.
Jesus took us to the Kingdom.
Morgan said you just left.
I was out here.
I saw you.
Why'd you go? I had to.
I heard something when I was on watch, from inside the wall.
I went into the pantry, one of them jumped me.
She was angry because she didn't get the supplies from the boat after all the waiting.
So they made me pack up everything else.
But she said they were at the boat, so I hoped No.
You didn't just hope.
You got us here.
I was beginning to lose faith.
But then I saw you.
And you nodded at me.
I mean, just the fact that you knew I didn't leave, that you searched and found me, that you, seeing these numbers, you seemed so glad.
We will set things right.
But things are gonna get very hard before that time.
We have to hold on.
I will.
Thank you.
What made you smile? [Chuckles.]
What made you so confident? [Chuckles.]
Someone showed me enemies can become friends.
[Chuckles.]
Rosita: We shouldn't be going back to Alexandria.
We need to stay out and look for the guns for this deal.
Rick is hurt.
Aaron is hurt.
I'm more nervous about what Eric will say if he sees my face like this again.
People back home need food.
Rick wants to bring supplies back and we regroup, so that's what we're doing.
Then I'll go on my own.
We are sticking together, and that's it.
What is your problem? We're not looking for a fight right now, Rosita! We're getting ready for one.
It's always a fight, Tara.
I'm not letting anyone get in our way or slow us down.
If we got to stop people from taking from us or we got to take from other people, I don't care.
We win.
Grow up.
Woman: Guns.
Soon.
Soon.
Or else.
Michonne: Once we get you stitched up, we'll go right back out and find the guns, right? That's right.
Do you have any idea where? No, but that's never stopped us before.
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.
At least you can tell us where not to look.
Yeah.
[Chuckles.]
Sure thing.
Rosita: Let's go already.
Hold -- Hold on.
Why are you? [Chuckles.]
Because we won.
And to replace the one you lost.
All right? Let's go.
I couldn't lose anyone.
I couldn't lose any of them.
I couldn't lose you.
I couldn't kill them.
I could.
I would.
If they hurt any of our people -- any more of them -- that's what I would do.
And there wouldn't be anything let of me after that.
The Saviors -- did they come? Yeah.
Did anyone get hurt? Is everybody okay? [Voice breaking.]
Did the Saviors Is everybody back home okay? Daryl They came.
We got them all.
Made a deal with the rest of them, like Ezekiel.
[Sobs.]
Everyone's all right.
Everyone's all right.
[Sniffles.]
[Sighs.]
[Clears throat.]
We gonna eat or -- or I got to be a king or something to get food around here? [Chuckles.]
[Sniffles.]
Shut up.
[Chuckles.]
[Chuckles.]
Ezekiel is he okay? Yeah, I think he is.
Watch out for yourself, all right? [Door creaks.]
[Shiva grunting.]
Morgan: Well, you're good with her.
Ezekiel will be impressed.
Well, figure any guy that has a pet tiger can't be that bad.
He's okay by Carol.
Yeah, I found her, out in that little house.
Look, what I said when I said she just went away it's what she told me to do.
No, I get it.
We need the Kingdom.
You got to make that happen.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I -- I really am, but, uh it can't be me.
[Sighs.]
Look, whatever it is you're holding on to it's already gone, man.
Wake the hell up.
You're the same as me, Daryl.
You don't know shit about me.
No, I do.
'Cause you didn't tell Carol what happened.
You didn't, 'cause she'd be here otherwise.
And I'm glad for that.
See, we're all holding on to something.
[Shiva grunts.]
I'm going back to Hilltop in the morning and getting ready.
