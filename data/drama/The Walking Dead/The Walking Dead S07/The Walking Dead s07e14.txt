1 (announcer) Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead" (Eugene) I need a search party.
See if Daryl ran home, like the dumb animal that he is.
Daryl does turn up here, just know there's no statute of limitations on this.
One utterly, completely, stone cold Negan.
How many people here can fight? Who would train all this cannon fodder? I will.
Give me a week.
I memorized everything.
Daryl and Carl took Rick by the inside of Negan's place.
There's only two of us.
Are you changing your mind? I'm ready to kill him.
[Sighs.]
[Birds chirping.]
[Birds chirping.]
[Gate opens.]
[Gate closes.]
Sasha: Hi.
Are you here -- I'm here because I need your help.
Sorry for taking over your trailer.
Oh.
I grew up with a lot of people around.
I'm used to it.
Big family? Uhgroup home.
This isn't like that, though.
Not the bad parts, at least.
For the first time, I feel like I belong.
Trying to make sure you and Sasha became a part of this made me a part of this.
When I was first here I was never here.
I, um I always found it hard getting close to anyone -- neighbors, friends boyfriends.
You should try it sometime.
Even if it doesn't last.
I'm gonna talk to our blacksmith about making more spears.
Maybe we can trade with the Kingdom for some body armor.
Thing is, what we really need is riot gear.
[Indistinct conversations.]
[Sighs.]
[Door opens.]
I was looking for something to read the other day.
You can have the bullets.
I didn't know you had a gun.
I didn't.
I do now.
Sasha, don't go -- not yet.
[Sighs.]
Rosita didn't come here to train people.
You're both going after Negan.
But you can't do that without people.
A lot of people.
We've talked about this.
I know what you think.
And I appreciate that.
But I'm not gonna change my mind.
She's not.
Does Maggie know Rosita's here yet? Uh, I-I-I don't think so.
I didn't You should tell her.
About all of it.
No.
Not yet.
Sh-- I'm still -- I'm still getting ready.
And the thing is, Rosita is going, with or without me.
So it should be with me.
Then I'll go, too.
Me, too.
No.
The Hilltop has to be ready for what happens after.
Maggie needs you.
She needs you, too.
Not anymore.
She has everyone else, and they have her.
You can stay.
I know you can.
But I know you won't and she won't, but I wish you would.
'Cause it's a long life, and then it isn't.
You can take anything else you need.
But you and Rosita need to talk to Maggie.
You owe her that much.
[Door closes.]
Listen Enid Maggie trusts you.
You have to protect her, no matter what.
She's the future of this place.
I know it.
So are you.
Hold on to this for me.
It's for the baby.
Maybe you can work on it while I'm gone.
Okay.
Sasha Yeah.
In 10 minutes, I'm gonna tell Maggie what's going on.
It's up to you what you want to do with that.
I'm doing what you asked.
[Door closes.]
[Clanging.]
The Saviors are coming! [Clanging continues.]
The Saviors are coming! We have to get Maggie.
Where is she? Come on! Where do we hide? We're not hiding.
All right, get in.
It goes to the other side.
We got to get out before Maggie does.
[Grunts.]
[Vehicles approaching.]
We'll never make it in time.
Come on! Just stay down there.
I'll keep them away.
They aren't the same ones who came to Alexandria.
Gregory: Simon! Hello.
Right back at you, Gregory.
Hello.
Ahh.
[Both laugh.]
We weren't, uh, expecting you back so soon.
You want to talk in my office? I got a bottle of gin my people found.
You're a gin man, right? Oh, I'm a man of shifting specifics of tastes in transition.
I'm into tequila now.
AÃ±ejo.
Reposado.
Sipping, mixing Un mundo de sabor.
[Chuckles.]
Gin seems like turpentine.
[Chuckles.]
It happened quick with a gimlet the other night.
I'm an unusual kind of creature.
You know what? I respect that.
Yeah.
Tequila.
Mental note.
Locked.
Great.
Oh, no need to talk.
This is hopefully a quick visit.
Oh.
Well, what can I do for you? That's an excellent question.
Alas, the answer's not so excellent.
You have a certain somebody that, uh now needs to be Negan's certain somebody, so what you can do for me is point me in their direction.
So, who is it? You get your pointy finger up, and I'll tells ya.
[Chuckles.]
Daryl.
[Door creaks.]
Daryl.
Daryl.
Did you dig that tunnel? Maggie thought we needed a quick way out.
So I made one.
Well, we're out.
So now what? You know.
If this one starts, I'll siphon some gas.
I just got to find -- There's an empty water bottle.
I thought this was the one, but Like it? I made it.
Car's dead.
[Bird squawking in distance.]
[Car door creaks.]
Where'd you learn to disarm bombs? [Car door creaks.]
Were you in the Army? [Sighs.]
Someone I knew.
Not him.
Listen, I'm not here to play "Get to Know You," so either we talk about the mission or we don't.
Okay.
Jesus said there's some buildings, two, three, four stories, just outside the sanctuary to the east of it.
At least one of them should have a line of sight to the rear courtyard, past the fence with the walkers on it.
We hole up, we wait, we take a shot from there.
If we have to get closer, there's some weak spots in the perimeter we might still be able to take advantage of, but if we can, I say we stay outside, do it clean.
Maybe make it out of there alive.
You see a problem with that? I want to make sure we get him.
That means we go in.
If we shoot from a distance and miss, we don't get another chance.
I won't miss.
Even if you shoot and graze him, he doesn't die.
I won't miss.
If we go in and get caught -- I won't get caught.
What the hell's wrong with you? They take us, we don't get another try.
Because they'll kill us.
If we're out here, we're alive.
We get another go.
[Walkers growling.]
Nothing is wrong with me, Sasha.
I'm gonna make sure he's dead.
Look, if this is too much for you, you want to bail, now's your chance.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, I'm done talking about it.
Good.
Maybe you'll think about it.
Maybe you'll change your mind about what it takes to get what you want.
Hi! Uh, I've got fresh veggies -- Stop.
They're vegetables.
Use the whole word.
We have time.
Uh Okay.
I have these vegetables they told me to bring over, uh, and the basket's pretty heavy.
[Chuckles.]
For me, I mean.
Probably not you.
Uh, here.
Load them in the truck, and, uh, if you meet me by the garden, I can get you the rest -- Stop.
I don't know who you think I am or who we are.
Load them yourself.
I'm busy.
Oh.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Girl, pick that shit up right now and scram.
And I'll take that.
Now.
Don't make me cut it off you, girl.
[Door creaks.]
[Footsteps.]
[Door creaks.]
[Sniffs.]
Dr.
Harlan Carson, correct? Do you need a checkup? Simon: Probably.
It's been a few years, but I'm not here for that.
[Door closes.]
We already gave you as much medicine as we could spare the last time you were here.
Yes, you did.
But we're not here to take more of that.
Congratulations! You're moving up in the world.
Negan wants you where he is.
You're an important fellow, Harlan.
You're coming with us.
Look, I -- I have patients here that need me.
Why does Negan need two doctors? Well, I think my look may have conveyed the information.
People say I have an expressive face.
But if not, let me repeat your question.
Why do we need two doctors? Answer -- we don't.
So my brother pissed someone off, get himself killed? Something like that.
Very, very ugly stuff.
My condolences.
But it's time.
All of my charts are in order.
You need to make arrangements for some kind of medical care here, especially for my ongoing patients.
I will.
I need to pack.
Simon: You don't.
We have everything you need, and what we don't, we'll get.
Hey, you like ice cream? We have ice cream.
We have a lady that makes cardamom gelato.
Shit you not.
Oh! Almost forgot.
Set that down.
[Box thuds.]
Well, fair is fair.
We're not leaving you high and dry when it comes to medical solutions.
Go on.
[Sighs.]
[Box closes.]
Simon, a word? Mm.
Look, I think I've proven that I can work with Negan.
I'm a can-do guy, but I got to hang on to my peoples' trust.
Otherwise, you don't know who might take over.
You know, someone else might not be so cooperative.
They might have crazy ideas.
Who might take over? What crazy ideas? I don't know.
I'm just considering worst-case scenarios.
You know, What I'm saying is, I know human nature, and it isn't inconceivable.
I hear your concern.
Mm.
I'm not insensitive to it.
Mm.
Right? If you're having problems of that nature come to see me.
Anytime.
I don't know where to go.
[Chuckles.]
I'll arrange it so that you just tell the guard who you are Mm-hmm.
and he'll let you right in.
Long as there's no shenanigans afoot.
There will be none.
[Chuckles.]
I just -- I just would like you to consider -- Wonderful.
Hmm? We'll crack open some tequila.
We'll talk.
We'll work it out.
You're a good producer for us.
I don't want you to be so stressed.
Yeah.
I'd be a lot less stressed if you'd leave my doctor.
Gregory Got it.
Okay.
I won't ask again.
[Footsteps.]
[Box thuds.]
[Door creaks.]
[Footsteps depart.]
He's gone.
[Sighs.]
You were gonna kill that guy.
He was gonna find us.
He wasn't, and he didn't.
He deserved to die.
Ever since you got here, you haven't said a word to me.
Would you look at me? Please? [Sniffles.]
Daryl [Voice breaking.]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[Sniffles.]
It wasn't your fault.
[Sniffles.]
It was.
No.
It wasn't.
You're one of the good things in this world.
That's what Glenn thought.
And he would know, 'cause he was one of the good things, too.
[Shuddered breathing.]
And, uh I wanted to kill that guy, too.
I wanted to string them all up and watch them die.
But we have to win.
Help me win.
[Truck engines start.]
[Walkers growling.]
This'll work.
[Glass shatters.]
[Growling continues.]
Now.
[Growling continues.]
[Grunts.]
[Electricity crackles.]
[Engine starts.]
Get in! [Growling continues.]
[Engine revs.]
[Tires screech.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Sighs.]
Anything? Negan still hasn't come out.
But Eugene's out there.
Eugene? It looks like he's ordering people around.
Playing some angle.
Will you teach me those knots? I know a bunch, but not those.
Won't matter soon.
It might.
[Sighs.]
Yeah, I'll show you.
All right, here's the first one.
Cross it over your hand like that.
Mm.
Then you take the top loop, bring it down, up, and back through, then Got it? Let me try.
[Chuckles.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
[Insects chirping.]
You know we got lucky, having you with us.
You know how to do everything.
[Sighs.]
Johnny.
That's who taught me about bombs.
Survivalist, prepper-type shit.
[Both chuckle.]
Marcus taught me about cars.
He was a mechanic and a wannabe stunt driver.
And an asshole.
Knot-tying was from Chaser.
Yeah, that wasn't his real name.
[Both laugh.]
There were others.
Were those people you lost on the way to D.
C.
? No, not them.
A lot of guys wanted to protect me, like there was no way I could know how to take care of myself.
And I didn't.
And I hated the way that felt.
So I rolled with it.
They didn't even notice I was picking up everything they knew how to do and doing it better.
Then I'd outgrow them and bounce.
The sex was just for fun.
[Both laugh.]
When the world's over, everyone should be getting their rocks off.
Was that how it was with him? Abraham? No.
I fell in with him because he saw I could handle my shit.
And I never looked back.
Well, no, I did.
When it was over.
Yeah.
You know the thing that killed me? When we got to Alexandria, I was acting like I was all good 'cause he wasn't.
[Chuckles.]
Then, the son of a bitch was actually all good.
[Chuckles.]
And I couldn't figure this one out.
Living there, feeling like we had made it, I couldn't pick that up.
Then, when he bounced, I I thought I hated you.
But maybe I just hated that he figured out his shit first.
[Scoffs.]
I've never told anyone any of that stuff.
Who I was, what I did I'm glad that you felt like you could.
I was stupid to waste so much time.
Now I'll never get to tell Abraham I'm happy he was happy.
Were you happy? I was.
[Sniffles.]
[Sighs.]
It wasn't his time.
Abraham would've wanted to go out fighting.
And that asshole with the bat took that away, too.
To go out with a point to going out.
I guess we all want that.
No matter how it all goes down, I got your back.
And I've got yours.
You think that prick's out there yet? Hmm.
[Vehicles approaching.]
[Walkers growling.]
Sasha: Ohshit.
Rosita: What? Dr.
Carson, Maggie's doctor.
They brought him here.
[Walkers growling.]
Negan's out.
Oh, he's too close.
Ah, I can't get a clean shot.
Turn on the walkie.
[Walkie-talkie clicks, static.]
This is Dr.
Eugene Porter, Chief Engineer, speaking.
I'm gonna need a dozen more walkers, a.
k.
a.
"dead ones" in the local parlance, for expanding the fence protocol PDQ.
Actually, PFQ.
This is per Negan, who I also am, even if it takes all night to procure them, so I need able-bodied persons out there in the surrounding blocks of buildings snoopin' and snatchin', stat.
Negan will be indisposed in the boudoir, so in the meantime, any questions should be directed to yours truly.
Dr.
Eugene Porter, Chief Engineer, also known as Negan, who I am.
Change of plans.
So we go in.
[Gun cocks.]
I'm ready.
[Knock on door.]
Come in.
Freddie said you wanted to see me? Yes, have a seat.
I noticed you've been slacking on your scavenging and recruiting lately.
And there are too many people in your trailer.
Fire hazard.
Plenty of room here at Barrington House for our guests.
Speaking of which, I have job assignments for the newcomers.
People are gonna stay, they're gonna chip in.
No more free rides on the teat.
You let them take Dr.
Carson.
Surprised you didn't kneel again.
You must be really worried if you're trying to split everyone up.
[Chuckles.]
Shouldn't talk to me like that.
Who knows what might happen with all these Saviors coming around? Did you just threaten me? I was being sarcastic, okay? No, I think you just threatened me.
Think what you want.
You know, what I'm saying is, I look out for my friends, and I realized we're not friends.
[Knock on door.]
Come in.
Ah, wonderful -- tequila.
Crack that open for me, would you? You may go now.
Show him out, will you, Kal? [Sighs.]
Everything okay? Where's Sasha and Rosita? You see that over there? That is a half-assed attempt at a safety protocol.
We need a full-assed, full-court press.
That stuff out front with the spikes and the chains and the heads, that's good for the optics.
It sends a message to would-be intruders of the "Don't Mess with Texas" variety.
[Inhales deeply.]
But we need to drill down on actual safety protocol, especially at points that have proven to be janky.
Well, yeah.
That's why I'm on guard duty now.
No offense to that last guy, but he could hardly handle a gun.
[Silenced gunshot.]
[Body thuds.]
Get up.
You're getting out.
Eugene, get up.
We're breaking you out.
Eugene! No.
I'm not going with you.
What? I didn't ask you to come, so go.
People got to be en route.
[Door closes.]
That weak, lying sack of shit.
This is it.
I'm going in.
Hold on.
This is gonna take a second.
More could be coming back.
Keep an eye out.
[Fence clattering.]
Just another second.
What the hell are you doing? Go.
It's not your time.
There's got to be a point to it, right? They need you.
[Silenced gunshot.]
[Groans.]
[Indistinct shouting, machine-gun fire.]
[Machine-gun fire continues.]
[Crying.]
Damn it.
Damn it! [Sobbing.]
