" That true? You wanna help? I do.
Okay.
We have to get ready.
We have to fight.
We do.
(Rick) We get you the guns, we fight together.
Say yes.
Yes.
They're out there, so I'm gonna be there with you.
We are.
Package deal.
You have to get me something.
A knife, a gun (Eugene) This will do it.
It's a poison.
[Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free" plays.]
[Buzzing in distance.]
Hang on to the world As it spins around [Breathing shallowly.]
Just don't let The spin get you down Think of moving fast Hold on tight, and you will last Give your [Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free" plays.]
[Low rumbling in distance.]
Hey, darlin'.
Wake up.
Abraham: Hey, darlin'.
Wake up.
What is it? Do we need to -- No, no, no.
We're okay for now.
[Sighs.]
Well, good afternoon to you.
You're here.
Yeah.
[Sighs.]
And I'm feelin' all kinds of glad to see you right now.
[Chuckles.]
Are they back? Not yet.
I know you were pullin' late shift, and you wanna tonight, so I didn't want to wake you up.
[Sighs.]
Maggie's in trouble.
What? Something with the baby.
Rick's taking her to the doctor at Hilltop.
He doesn't know it yet, but I'm going with him.
I just I know we just started this, but I wanted you to -- Don't.
[Chuckling.]
"Don't" what? Don't go.
[Lock disengages, latch clicks.]
[Door opens, hinges creak.]
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life, Sasha.
You are gonna help make sure things get back on track today.
You are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit, and you don't suffer one goddamn fool.
No one's gonna wanna watch you die.
I don't wanna see that.
So you don't have to.
But someone does.
Maybe a couple others -- tops.
But not you and not most people.
We are gonna help solve some shit.
Tuck in.
Big day.
What do you need from me? Rick: Look at me.
Why? 'Cause I want it stopped.
I want Negan dead.
So why don't you kill him? Can't just be me.
They're all Negan.
That girl you murdered she had a name.
Her name was Denise, and she was a doctor.
And she helped people.
I wasn't aiming for her.
[Gasps.]
[Grunts.]
[Breathing heavily.]
Do it.
Do it.
You wanna end it this way you go ahead.
I'm sorry.
I am.
I know you want to.
He could just be here to see if you were here.
We can't trust him.
Dwight: He owned me.
But not anymore.
What I did, I was doing it for someone else.
She just got away.
So now I'm here.
So are you because of her.
Tara: Do it! There's another choice.
Daryl.
Daryl, you knew her.
Negan trusts me.
[Breathing heavily.]
We work together, we can stop him.
You knew me then, and you know me now.
You know I'm not lying.
I'm not.
Do it.
Do it! [Breathing sharply.]
[Breathing heavily.]
[Breathing shallowly.]
They have Sasha, if she's even alive.
Jesus: Why didn't you say something? He could be our only chance to get her back.
Rosita: Because I don't trust him.
But I trust Daryl.
Negan's coming soon.
Tomorrow.
Three trucks probably.
20 Saviors and him.
I can slow them down, bring some trees down in the road, buy a little time for you guys to get ready.
If you can take them out, that's where we start.
You kill them, I'll radio back to the Sanctuary.
The Sanctuary? Where Negan lives.
That's what they call it.
I can radio back to them and say everything's okay.
You drive the trucks back, and I can lead you right inside, and, with the right plan, we can wipe out the rest.
Check to see if your friend's still alive.
Then, we get the workers on our side, build our numbers up, and go from outpost to outpost and end this.
Keep talking.
[Gate creaking.]
Rick: We just started it -- the whole thing.
[Vehicle door closes, engine starts.]
If he's lyin', I'm gonna kill him real slow.
When this is done, I don't give a damn if he's sorry.
I will kill that son of a bitch.
If he's lying, this is already over.
[Gate creaking.]
Someday we'll all be free, yeah Oh, I gotta go.
Abraham: Oh, I gotta go.
Fact is, I figured we'd -- I had a dream.
You You had a dream about me? You died.
Negan: That's the plan.
That's what I need from you.
And when you come out, not a peep.
They will stand down, if they haven't already.
And then, Lucille here, well, she gets her three, and we move forward with a new understanding.
[Chuckles.]
Are you -- Are you shitting me? Is that real? I can do it, but no one has to die.
You are wrong.
Punishment -- can't do anything without that.
Punishment is how we built everything we have.
You think I'm gonna sit here and let you -- Careful! You are not letting me do anything.
No one has to die.
[Scoffs.]
Okay.
How about this? One.
Just one.
I mean, I was gonna pull three outta the pool, but just one and just for you.
Okay.
Just one person has to die.
[Chuckles.]
[Sighs.]
You got me wrapped around your little finger.
You know that? And it's not a man/woman thing.
I mean, if you had a dick, I would still have these feelings.
We roll out in 45.
[Hinges creaks, door slams.]
So we don't have Oceanside, but we have their guns.
Negan has Sasha.
Daryl wants us to trust Dwight.
Rick wants us to stay here in case things go wrong so there's another card to play, another safe place the Saviors think they control.
But he doesn't know that Gregory's gone that maybe he's telling them things that'll make them think something else.
And it's all about to happen.
You're thinking of leading the Hilltop over there to fight.
I am.
If Negan finds out they're planning something, they're gonna need help, even with those Scavengers on their side.
Well, you'd have to decide right now, and it's a very tough decision.
Why are you smiling? 'Cause I'm glad you're the one making it for us.
[Scoffs.]
Judith: [Coos.]
How do I? Jesus: I don't know.
I just know you can.
[Coos.]
Let me take her.
You take this.
[Babbles.]
Enid: Yeah.
Mm.
Hmm? Guns up, now.
[Guns cock, Shiva growls lightly.]
What the hell? He's dead.
What is it? We've seen this before.
[Shiva growling softly.]
Morgan: Same ones.
[Sighs.]
Jerry: Dude, you okay? You're gonna ambush them on your own? Yeah.
Going alone doesn't work for this.
It works for me.
Have you killed any of them? Because if you have and they've found out, they may think it was the Kingdom, and we lose our advantage.
It's from walkers.
Daniel: Can we move them aside? [Shiva growls lightly.]
Do you seek to extinguish everything of who you were? I don't seek it, but I'm stuck.
You want the Saviors dead? Morgan.
Yes, I do.
Cease this folly.
Accompany my regiment.
The Saviors are a dragon with many heads, their numbers legion.
We must seek allies in this endeavor.
That's Benjamin's armor.
Do you wear it to serve you, or do you wear it in his honor? Morgan you are not stuck.
Join us on this journey to create an alliance.
Fight with us, and we shall defeat them so that no one will suffer under their capricious malevolence ever again.
And we start once more for the fallen for the Kingdom [Shiva growling softly.]
Ezekiel: for the glory of victory.
Ho! [Birds chirping.]
[Vehicles approaching.]
[Brakes squeak.]
[Engines stop, air brakes hiss.]
[Gate creaking.]
[Creaking stops.]
[Gate bangs.]
What you fight for.
Not the place -- the people, each other.
You're a part of that now.
We take.
We don't bother --our way.
Maybe another way.
Yours? Yeah, we're together.
I lay with him after.
You care? We should get back to work.
Yeah.
[Suspenseful music plays.]
[Chainsaw buzzing.]
Think this was them? Negan: Crossed my mind.
We got a plan "B.
" If I might be so bold this unexpected stoppage has given me the chance for an exhaustive mull.
Now, given the loaded circumstances and potential for casualties and resource expenditure, I was wondering if you would give me the opportunity to attempt to slow their jets and cool their roll.
[Chainsaws buzzing.]
[Brakes squeak, engine shuts off.]
You shoot one of these before? Good.
Worry? [Sighs.]
No.
Good.
I'll be on the next one over.
Why? It's more sight lines if we split up.
I'll go.
You sure? Okay.
We win.
Yeah.
[Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free" plays.]
[Breathing shallowly.]
[Rumbling in distance.]
You know what's gonna happen, how this is gonna end.
You know what's gonna happen, how this is gonna end.
We're gonna walk out that door together.
We kick shit and eat snakes.
That's us.
We can sit this one out.
They need us here, anyway.
Rick said to get ready for a fight.
How'd I die? [Sighs.]
We were at the beach.
It was before.
Mm.
You got pulled under and you didn't come back up.
I was trying to find you, but you were gone.
And then, I started to drown.
I hate the beach.
[Sighs.]
End of the day in a wet suit? It's like you're sandblasting your nutsack every single step you take back to the car.
[Laughs.]
[Chuckles.]
Luckily, the seaside ain't on the agenda today.
Just security and some road to chew.
All right? So, come on.
Let's go help Maggie.
Abraham.
What? They can use us here.
[Sighs.]
Just once, we sit one out.
Someone else -- It should be us.
Maggie's gotta take care of Maggie.
Have you, uh, changed your mind about taking that allergy medication? Yes.
Good.
I think you'll get adjusted to the place, sinus-wise.
No, I won't.
Not like you.
Everyone has a way out.
Don't go and yuck my yum for takin' mine, which, I may add, is the same as yours now.
If people die today, it's 'cause of the choices they made.
Yeah.
It is.
[Sighs.]
Why are we here? [Birds chirping.]
For this.
[Turkey call sounding.]
[Turkey call sounds in distance.]
[Suspenseful music plays.]
Rosita.
Get into position.
I'll signal you.
And the wall's gonna hold? It'll hold.
[Vehicles approaching.]
Eugene: All points are covered.
Every contingency is already met.
I come armed with two barrels of the truth.
A test is upon you, and I'm giving out the cheat sheet.
[Brakes squeak.]
[Air brakes hiss.]
[Engines shut off.]
H-Hello.
I come salved with the hope that it is my dropped knowledge that you heed.
Options are zero to none.
[Sighs.]
Compliance and fealty are your only escape.
Bottom-lining it -- You may thrive, or you may die.
I sincerely wish for the former for everyone's sake.
The jig is up and in full effect.
Will you comply, Rick? Where's Negan? I'm Negan.
[Suspenseful music plays.]
[Sighs.]
[Sighs.]
[Sighs.]
[Guns cock.]
[Lock clicks.]
[Gate thuds.]
[Breathing heavily.]
No.
[Rifle cocks.]
We win.
[Suspenseful music plays.]
You ever hear the one about the stupid little prick named Rick who thought he knew shit but didn't know shit and got everyone he that gave a shit about killed? Negan: It's about you.
You're all gonna wanna put your guns down now.
No one drops anything.
We had a deal.
Tamiel came for the boat things.
Followed ones who took.
Made a better deal.
[Sighs.]
Negan: You push me, and you push me.
And you push me, Rick.
You just tried to blow us up, right? I mean, I get me, my people.
But Eugene? He's one of yours.
And after what he did -- He stepped up.
You people are animals.
Universe gives you a sign, and you just shove your finger right up its ass.
[Laughs.]
Dwight, Simon, chop-chop.
[Sighs.]
So, you don't like Eugene anymore.
You guys gotta like Sasha.
I do, too.
Got her right here packaged for your convenience, alive and well.
Now, I brought her so I wouldn't have to kill all of you, and not killing all of you could get complicated.
See, I know there's a lot of firepower left in there, Rick.
So I'm gonna make this simple.
I want all the guns you've managed to scrape up.
Yep, I know about those, too.
I want every last grain of lemonade you got left.
I want a person of your own choosing for Lucille.
Daryl -- Ooh, I gotta get me my Daryl back.
I see you.
And the pool table and all the pool cues and chalk.
And I want it now or Sasha dies, and then all of you.
Probably.
C'mon, Rick.
Just because I brought her in a casket doesn't mean she has to leave in it.
[Sighs.]
[Chuckles.]
You know what? You suck ass, Rick.
You really do.
I don't want to have to kill her, but that's exactly what you're gonna make me do.
Let me see her.
[Chuckling.]
Oh.
All right.
Just give me a second.
I might have to get her up to speed.
You can't hear shit inside this thing.
Sash.
You're not gonna believe this crap.
[Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free" plays.]
It felt real.
It felt real.
Like we lost this.
[Sighs.]
And this just started.
[Sighs, sniffles.]
C'mon.
Wait.
[Sighs.]
I like the way you call bullshit.
So let me return the favor.
The next thing you're gonna tell me is that you'll go and that I can stay.
Because I know you didn't like hearing yourself just say that, "Maggie's gotta take care of Maggie.
" I know those words are gonna choke in your ears a good, long while and you're gonna wanna make up for even thinking that.
Am I right? Yeah.
We lay our big meaties across the chopping block ahead of someone else's.
It's always for someone else.
Both of us know, if we're gonna kick, there sure as hell better be a point to it.
So maybe we feel there was a-a point to all of this.
Alpha to omega.
Whether it's on the battlefield or the beach or somewhere out there today.
Maggie -- She's carrying the future.
You're right.
[Sniffles.]
I knew how this was gonna end.
C'mon.
Layin' your ass on the line for someone else, tearin' it to shreds for 'em -- You said it before.
Oh, my, that is living.
[Chuckles.]
You're an idiot.
I never said otherwise.
[Sighs.]
A couple hours to get there, right? At least.
Might be a circuitous and janky route.
With what they're planning, they could be watching the roads.
"What they're planning.
" That's right.
Got it in the marketplace.
It's chock-full.
Doubt conversation will be on tap for the commute.
And though I am a selfish coward, I do tend to think of other people on occasion.
Please take it with my compliments.
I truly wish I measured up.
You still can, Eugene.
I'm not giving up.
Not on you.
Jesus, you don't have to take the trip in the thing.
I could use the rest.
No shit? Yeah.
I just want to go to sleep.
I just need a little bottle of water, and I'm fine.
[Breathes deeply.]
Arat? [Sighs.]
Listen I know how tough this is.
And I appreciate it.
Damn, you are something else.
[Knocks twice on coffin.]
[Lid creaks, thuds.]
[Music player clicking.]
[Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free" plays.]
[Engine starts.]
[Engine rumbling.]
Hang on to the world As it spins around [Sighs.]
Just don't let The spin get you down Things are moving fast [Knock on lid.]
Sash.
You're not gonna believe this crap.
[Growling.]
Holy goddamn! [Dramatic music plays.]
[Gunfire.]
[Groans.]
[Both grunt.]
[Gunfire continues.]
[Grunts.]
[Groaning.]
Man: Go! Go! No.
[Growling.]
Aah! [Grunts.]
Honey, God damn it! [Screaming.]
[ Gunfire continues .]
[Shouts.]
Plan "B" it is! [Gunshot.]
Down.
Now.
We can make another deal.
Aah! [Groaning.]
Aah! [Gunfire continues.]
Said "down.
" [Gunfire.]
[Dramatic music plays.]
[Gunfire in distance.]
[Man shouting indistinctly.]
[Gasps, groans.]
Move.
Hello again.
Farron: [Growling.]
Michonne: [Choking.]
Aah! [Gunfire in distance.]
Down.
Or again.
[Suspenseful music plays.]
[Men shout indistinctly in distance.]
Well, shit, Rick.
You just couldn't stick with us, huh? You had to go with these filthy garbage people? No offense.
Deal is for 12, yes? People are a resource.
[Gunfire in distance.]
[Chuckles.]
[Sighs.]
Rick.
This is just gonna make you sad.
Broken.
You're gonna wish you were dead.
[Sighs.]
I like having fun.
I do.
But maybe you think that the guy that did what he did to your friends wasn't me, like that was some sort of a put-on, like I'm not the guy with the bat -- I'm just the guy that makes your kid spaghetti.
[Gunfire in distance.]
Oh.
Oh, shit.
Maybe this is on me.
Maybe this is all on me.
[Gunfire continues.]
I gotta make it right.
I guess I gotta start all over again.
I gotta tell you, Rick, if I had a kid, I'd want him to be just like your kid, which makes this so much harder.
You're not gonna win.
Carl.
It is over.
Why don't you point your one ball up the street there and take it all in? [Dramatic music plays.]
[Grunting.]
We'll win! We live! We're the ones! Us! [Grunts.]
[Woman screams.]
[Gasps lightly.]
[Chuckling.]
Ohh.
Oh.
Wow.
You just lost somebody important to you right now -- like, just now.
Jesus.
That is timing.
Well, Rick you chose this.
I truly don't know what more I could've done to warn you.
And this isn't a warning.
This is punishment.
I'm gonna kill Carl now.
I'm gonna make it one nice, hard swing, try to do it in one because I like him.
I just want you to put that in your brain and roll it around for a minute.
I'm gonna kill Carl, and then Lucille here, she's gonna take your hands.
You can do it right in front of me.
You can take my hands.
I told you already -- I'm gonna kill you.
All of you.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but nothing is gonna change that -- nothing.
You're all already dead.
[Chuckling.]
Damn.
Wow, Rick.
Okay.
Negan: [Grunts.]
[Ominous tones play.]
You said I could do it.
[Shiva roars, all shout indistinctly.]
Man: [Screaming.]
[Gunfire.]
[Horse neighs.]
[Dramatic music plays.]
End these Saviors and their accomplices! Alexandria will not fall, not on this day! [Gunfire continues.]
[Screaming.]
[Rifle cocks.]
Aah! Phalanx out, third group, now! Move up! Now we got your backs! [Horse neighs.]
A goddamn tiger! [Gunfire continues.]
That widow is alive, guns a-blazin'! [Machine gun clicks.]
You taste that, Simon? That is the taste of shit! [Shiva growls.]
[Gunfire continues.]
[Gunfire continues, bullets ricochet.]
[Gunfire in distance.]
Rick: They're falling back.
Maggie: Eduardo, Bertie, between the houses -- Cover the gate! [Gunfire in distance.]
Let's go.
Ezekiel: Now we finish this! [Horse neighs, gunfire continues.]
[Gunfire, bullets ricocheting.]
[Horse neighs.]
[Gate creaking.]
Now! Pull! [All grunt.]
[Ominous tones play.]
[Both panting.]
[Breathing heavily.]
[Somber music plays.]
[Latch clicks, door opens.]
Michonne.
Michonne.
[Breathes shallowly.]
[Sighs.]
Oh, you're alive.
[Breathing heavily.]
We -- W-We're We're I know.
I know.
[Gasps.]
I know.
We are.
We will.
[Crying.]
Getting preparations in place.
Everyone's on "blue level.
" You say the word, they're ready to go.
That's good.
How the hell do you think she wound up dead in that box? My, um, best possible posit fingers the tarp.
That sealed up said box good and tight.
She ran out of air.
[Ominous tones play.]
Maybe.
[Sighs.]
So we are going to war! All: Yes, sir! [Somber music plays.]
Rick: Do you think Sasha did that herself? Maggie: I don't know how, but I know she did.
She gave us a chance.
You did.
You made the right decision to come.
The decision was made a long time ago, before any of us knew each other, when we were all strangers who would have just passed each other on the street before the world ended.
And now we mean everything to each other.
[Knife unsheathes.]
You were in trouble.
You were trapped.
Glenn didn't know you, but he helped you.
He put himself in danger for you.
And that started it all -- From Atlanta, to my daddy's farm, to the prison, to here to this moment now not as strangers -- as family because Glenn chose to be there for you that day a long time ago.
That was the decision that changed everything.
It started with both of you, and it just grew to all of us to sacrifice for each other to suffer and stand, to grieve, to give, to love, to live to fight for each other.
[no dialogue.]
Glenn made the decision, Rick.
I was just following his lead.
