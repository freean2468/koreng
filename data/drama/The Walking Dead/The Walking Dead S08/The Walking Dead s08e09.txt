Previously on AMC's "The Walking Dead" Save him.
Like you saved me.
- Wait.
- I liked you, Ezekiel.
Your people are gonna look up at the sanctuary fence, and they're going to see their king is dead.
We can't just let them have this place.
We can.
All we need to do is survive tonight.
[BREATHES SHARPLY.]
"My mercy prevails over my wrath.

[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
Jerry! S'up, Jude?! [LAUGHS.]
Hey, Rick.
Everything okay? Just came for some of that butternut skillet cake - you guys make.

You rode out from the Kingdom for dessert? Hells yah.
[CHUCKLES.]
You got roped into masonry duty.
[SIGHS.]
Siddiq, man.
[CHUCKLING.]
Dude's impossible to say no to.
Back to it.

[BRIGHT EYES' "AT THE BOTTOM OF EVERYTHING" PLAYS.]
1, 2 1, 2, 3, 4 It's just 'til I can talk to my dad.
We must talk in every telephone Get eaten off the web We must rip out all the epilogues From the books that we have read And to the face of every criminal Strapped firmly to a chair We must stare, we must stare, we must stare We must take all of the medicines Too expensive now to sell Set fire to the preacher Who is promising us hell Into the ear of every anarchist That sleeps but doesn't dream We must sing, we must sing, we must sing It'll go like this, all right? While my mother waters plants My father loads his gun He says death will give us back to God Just like the setting sun Is returned to the lonesome ocean If he's not back soon, we'll meet him there.
Hopefully, they'll be with him.
What about Michonne? Ah.
We must blend into the choir Sing a static with the whole We must memorize nine numbers And deny we have a soul And in this endless race for property And privilege to be won We must run, we must run, we must run We must hang up in the belfry Where the bats and moonlight laugh We must stare into a crystal ball And only see the past Into the caverns of tomorrow With just our flashlights and our love We must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge And then we'll get down there Way down to the very bottom of everything And then we'll see it, oh, we'll see it We'll see it, we'll see it Oh, my morning's coming back The whole world's waking up All the city buses swimming past I'm happy just because I found out I am really no one [SHUTTER CLICKS, WHIRS.]

[WOMAN SINGING OPERATICALLY OVER SPEAKERS.]
[CLANGING.]
Hey! Hey! [WALKERS GROWLING.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[ENGINES RUMBLING.]
[SOFT CLATTERING.]
[WALKER GROWLING SOFTLY.]
CAROL: I see it.
It got tripped up on my wire.
I got it.
[GROWLING STOPS.]
The cottage is just ahead, out of the tree-line.
It's got a wrought-iron fence.
There's food and water inside.
The Saviors don't know about it.
You'll be safe there until I make it back with Ezekiel.
You versus all of them? Yeah.
They don't stand a chance.
It's not just Carol.
I'm going, too.
No.
You're not.
They killed my brother.
And I'm not gonna let 'em kill you.
[SCOFFS LIGHTLY.]
I can do it.
I can help you.
Morgan taught me the stick.
You taught me the gun.
It's not happening.
[INSECTS CHIRPING.]
Come on.
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
[MUFFLED EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE.]
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE, ROCKS CLATTER.]
I-I don't CARL: Dad.
- How - Dad it's all right.
It's gotta be.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it back before But just in case, you know I wanted to make sure I was able to say goodbye.
No.
It's them.
It's them.
They They don't It wasn't [CRYING.]
Carl.
No.
I got bit.
I was bringing someone back.
His name's Siddiq.
We saw him at that gas station, before It wasn't the Saviors.
It just happened.
I got bit.
GAVIN: Negan's gonna kill you now.
I said he's gonna kill you.
And there's nothing I can do to stop that.
Hey.
You hear me? I ferried my people to freedom.
What befalls me now matters not.
No.
It matters, idiot.
I liked you, Ezekiel.
You got it.
You got that you couldn't do better than you had it.
You accepted things for what they were, and you didn't get any big ideas in your head.
And then Rick went and planted one right in there.
And here we are.
Shit's getting shittier.
And you're gonna die.
I made a choice I could live with.
Now it's your turn to do the same.
[WHISPERING.]
Henry! Hey.
[WHISPERING.]
They don't have enough people to guard all the walls.
No, but they do have people.
- And they have Ezekiel.
- I saw him.
They got him on the other side of this place.
We can take them.
One by one.
No, if we hit one of them, that could call them all.
It's better just to avoid them until we can't.
Henry.
He's here, too.
Where? Did you see him? Do they have him? Yeah, I saw him run this way, and then he was gone.
But he'll hide.
He won't take them on face-to-face.
We have to do this now.
So if we have to take them, we take them.
[GRUNTS.]
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS IN DISTANCE.]
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
Is that better? Yeah Thanks.
SIDDIQ: I, um, I got these.
They're over-the-counter, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.
They'll, um They'll help a little with the fever.
They did for my mom and dad.
[VOICE BREAKING.]
Please take them.
Your son he should have them.
You're a doctor? I was a resident before.
Yeah.
Your name is Siddiq? Yes.
Did you know he was a doctor? Is that why you brought him back? He wasn't gonna make it alone.
He needed us.
That's why.
He was the one at the gas station.
[LOUD THUMP, ROCKS CLATTER.]
[COUGHING.]
Shh! MICHONNE: Water.
Give him water.
[COUGHING CONTINUES.]
Easy.
You got it? Slowly, slowly.
[GRUNTING.]
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE.]
Make it stop.
Make them stop.
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE.]
- I can't.
- You can.
You're one of them.
They'll listen to you.
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
Please.
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE.]
Please.
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE.]
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE.]
You said that Hilltop's safe, right? Yeah.
We need to get everybody there.
We can get Carl there.
And they think all of you got away in the woods.
They're out there, looking.
They saw us go West, so we won't go West.
Your best chance is to stay here until they're gone.
DARYL: No.
They find us here, we're dead.
They're almost done.
They gotta be.
It wasn't about destroying the place.
They don't have the ammo for that.
After they let up, after they're gone, that's when we go.
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE.]
Okay.
We wait.
You sure going to Hilltop's the best plan? You got a better one? All of you in one place, together DARYL: All of us together We'll be their worst damn nightmare.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS.]
[FIRE CRACKLING.]
[FIRE EXTINGUISHER SPRAYING.]
[WHISPERING.]
If we don't go through 'em, we gotta go through the courtyard.
Exposed.
This is it.

[GROANING.]
No.
No.
[THUDS.]
[FLESH TEARS.]
Got all of 'em.
They could've found Henry.
I know.
I'm not worried about them.
GAVIN: Come on, boys.
Get the damn gum off your shoes.
Let's go! Is it gonna go bad, Ezekiel? Is this going to turn into something else? EZEKIEL: You are the author of this night, Gavin.
Its close shall be fashioned by your start.
You left.
[MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS IN DISTANCE.]
You were supposed to be resting.
I'm not tired.
Yeah.
You look great.
[CHUCKLES SOFTLY.]
[SIGHS.]
It's gotta stop, Michonne.
It's not supposed to be like this.
I know it can be better.
[WATER DRIPPING SOFTLY.]
SCOTT: Sounds like they're letting up.
Looks like you were right.
They're leaving.
DARYL: Maybe.
[SIGHS.]
Want me to go take a look? JUDITH: [COOING.]
[WHISPERING.]
Hey.
Hey.
[FOOTSTEPS.]
CAROL: There.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
MAN #1: sure as shit gonna beat living in that chemical dump.

You're gonna have to fight me for it [WHISPERING.]
Leave it.
Leave it.
Hey.
- [SILENCED GUNSHOT.]
- [GROANS.]
Let's go.
GAVIN: Leave some room for Ezekiel.
Get him a pillow or something.
It's gonna be his last ride.
Let's at least try to make him comfortable.
You try, and you try, and you try, and you hope, and you hope, and you hope.
Just wantin' things to finally just settle.
Achieve some goddamn, hard-fought equilibrium.
But, no.
It always comes down to this.
It always has to get dark and ugly and inhuman.
You know I don't like this, right? It is not too late to walk back from something decided.
[SCOFFS LIGHTLY.]
You did, and look where it got you.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
Duke.
Paulie.
Where you at? [CLICKS.]
Stop pickin' dingles, grab your walkie, and respond! [CLICKS.]
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS.]
[CLICKS, STATIC HISSES.]
Gomez? [CLICKS.]

[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
[MID-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYS.]
[BIRDS CHIRPING.]
EUGENE: I calibrate this cooker properly, we'll be lousy with baked apples ad infinitum.
It would be my honor if you considered to be the sous to my chef.
Or I could be said sous, and you shall surely chef.
'Til then, this Golden Delicious has your name on it.
Thanks, Eugene.
Thanks.
The Saviors are gone.
We can get everyone to Hilltop.
We can get Carl there.

CARL: Let me say goodbye.
[CREAKING.]
[BREATHES SHARPLY.]
You be good, okay? For Michonne.
For Dad.
You gotta honor him.
Listen when he tells you stuff.
You don't have to always.
Sometimes, kids got to show their parents the way.
[SIGHS.]
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
This was Dad's before it was mine.
Now it's yours.
[SNIFFLES.]
I don't know Just Just having it and It always kept Dad with me.
It made me feel as strong as him.
It helped me.
Maybe it'll help you, too.
Before Mom died she told me that I was gonna beat this world.
I didn't.
But you will.
[JUDITH WHINES SOFTLY.]
I know you will.
[CRYING.]
DARYL: Here we go.
[CRYING CONTINUES.]
These people.
You saved them all.
That's all you, man.
You were helping me honor my mom Not just yours.
Mine, too.
You brought me here.
You gave me a chance.
I know I can never repay you but I can honor you by showing your people, your f-friends, your your family that what you did wasn't for nothing.
That it mattered.
That it That it meant something.
Because it did.
So that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna honor you, Carl.
[BREATHING DEEPLY.]
Congratulations.
You're stuck with us.
[BREATHES SHARPLY.]
[CREAKING.]
[FOOTSTEPS.]
GAVIN: Okay.
There can't be a lot of 'em 'cause there aren't a lot left.
We got room for us and controlled access.
Force projected on the doors, now! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING.]
We end this, whatever the hell it is.
I gotta settle this shit under the penalty of that goddamn bat.
You don't.
Shut up about that, okay? This is it! It is too late.
I'm the "author," you're the dead man, and that's how it's gonna be.
You think I can be someone else? This is who I am.
I live, you die This is what this is! The petty compromises I made to avoid conflict were always done in the name of saving my people's lives.
Now I realize I was saving yours.
No more.

He was He was giving it up, and I I just I shot him.
I think about him.
What I did to him and how How easy it was to just kill him.
GAVIN: [GRUNTING.]
You're sick! Only a sick man would do it like this.
You think I wanted this? There wasn't a lot on the menu.
I ran a good crew.
I kept my word.
You ask Ezekiel I kept my word! [GROANS.]

For you and for them.
