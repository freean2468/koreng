1 Previously on AMC's "The Walking Dead" I can't leave, not until they join the fight.
You are gonna be in charge of your very own outpost.
You see, I need my bullet maker making bullets.
Don't matter if the big man ain't here.
He could very well be back.
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- Carl's dead.
He wrote letters.
He wrote one to you.
[HAMMERS POUNDING IN DISTANCE.]
CARL: I remember my 8th birthday at the KCC with that giant cake and Aunt Evie showing up on leave, surprising all of us.
I remember Mom.
I remember Codger.
I remember school and going to the movies and Friday-night pizza and cartoons and Grandma and Grandpa and church, those summer barbecues in the kiddie pool you got me.
Could've used that at the prison.
[CHUCKLES.]
You told me about the walks we'd take when I was 3, you holding my hand, around the neighborhood, all the way to Ross' farm.
I didn't know that I remembered them, but I do.
'Cause I see the sun and the corn and that cow that walked up to the fence and looked me in the eye.
And you told me about all that stuff, but it isn't just that stuff.
It's how I felt.
Holding your hand, I felt happy and special.
I felt safe.
I thought growing up was about getting a job and maybe a family, being an adult, but growing up is making yourself and the people you love safe As safe as you can, because things happen.
They happened before.
You were shot before things went bad.
Kind of felt like things went bad because you were shot.
I want to make you feel safe, Dad.
I want you to feel just like I felt when you held my hand.
Just to feel that way for five minutes.
I'd give anything to make you feel that way now.
I wanted to kill Negan.
I wish I did.
Maybe it would've been done.
I don't think it's done now.
You went out there again, but I don't think they surrendered.
I don't think they will surrender.
There are workers in there, Dad.
They're just regular people Old people, young people, families.
You don't want them to die, Dad.
We're so close to starting everything over, and we have friends now.
It's that bigger world Jesus talked about The Kingdom, the Hilltop There's there's got to be more places, more people out there, a chance for everything to change and keep changing, everyone giving everyone the opportunity to have a life A real life.
So if they won't end it, you have to.
You have to give them a way out.
You have to find peace with Negan, find a way forward somehow.
We don't have to forget what happened, but you can make it so that it won't happen again, that nobody has to live this way, that every life is worth something.
Start everything over.
Show everyone that they can be safe again without killing, that it can feel safe again, that it could go back to being birthdays and school and jobs and even Friday-night pizza somehow.
And walks with a dad and a 3-year-old holding hands.
Make that come back, Dad.
And go on those walks with Judith.
She'll remember them.
I love you.
Carl.
[SIGHS.]
[BED CREAKS.]
I came back here to make amends.
You made me look like an ass.
[SIGHS.]
[SIGHS.]
My intel wasn't current.
You know, things changed at Alexandria.
Juice.
Juice and momentum can change the game.
They had it, and they did it.
Margaret had the Hilltop by the nuts.
I didn't know it.
And, yes, we paid a price.
But let me make it right with Negan, hmm? I'm Negan.
And not in a collective, "We're all Negan" sense.
I have assumed control of the Saviors.
Negan is no longer on the field of play.
You're the man now? I am.
[GLASSES CLINK.]
I knew it.
I knew you could do it.
Negan was a big personality, I get it, but, uh too unconventional.
Pulled his punches.
Exactly.
Whereas you are the kind of man people can look at and say, "Now there is a leader.
" Which is why I can't be seen going easy on you.
Optics.
You don't have to worry about optics now.
- 'Cause you - Oh, I know.
I have that juice.
I have that momentum.
I want to keep it.
Ergo, you go.
[GLASS THUDS.]
Well, that is just breathlessly stupid.
Yep.
You think these Troglodytes here are gonna advise you in managing communities, in resource reallocations? In politics? That's right, yeah, the bare-knuckle gnad mash of politics? It is ended, Gregory.
No! I've achieved too much! I-I-I've suffered too much! I've survived too much for it to end like this! I've lashed myself to the bow, seen through the storm, and I have been reborn as a-a certified shit kicker! I make things happen! I've always made things happen.
And it's not gonna end with me wandering off into the wilderness with my dick in my hand.
I put things together when everything fell apart, and I can do it again.
I will do it again.
You know, who the hell are you to tell me I'm done? Yeah, you think you have the juice? Well, I am the juice! - No! - Whoa! [BREATHING HEAVILY.]
[GROANS.]
First I wasn't gonna send you away.
I was gonna kill you.
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
Second do you make coffee? Best in the land.
We'll start with coffee and see where it goes.
RACHEL: He's still out here.
Didn't see him when we left.
Maybe he finally gave up.
Nope.
He won't.
Not unless we make him.
We should just kill him.
[WALKER GROWLING.]
I got it.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[GRUNTS.]
Told ya.
KATHY: Has he eaten? [BREATHING HEAVILY.]
We made our choice.
He wants to die in the woods, hoping we change our minds.
That's his choice.
Find yourself some water.
Seems like a waste of good garlic to me.
And everything else.
That sardine mac-and-cheese recipe I gave you was a staple from my college days when, as a cash-strapped student, I had to pad out the budget-minded goodness of M-and-powdered-C with the protein power of canned sardines which provided a longer-lasting energy source than pure carbohydrates.
The garlic sautÃ© alleys what originated as a purely "oops" dish.
Mmm.
Takes me back.
Start plating it up.
This is all that's on the menu for the rest of the time till this order's complete.
[SPOON TAPPING.]
[TAPPING CONTINUES.]
I'd like to remind everyone that our lives are not on lock.
Out of personal respect to the mutual nature with Negan, but Negan is MIA.
Simon has taken over, and he has requested an exponential acceleration of production.
More shots on the lickety-quick.
Even if we're double-timing it around the clock with nary a carey for workplace safety, it isn't gonna prevent us from meeting our quixotic quota by the proverbial crap-ton.
The best that we can hope for is that we somehow manage to squeeze out the bare minimum number of rounds necessary to avoid the consequences of Simon finding out how short we are.
[GABRIEL COUGHING.]
[COUGHING CONTINUES.]
- No.
- [SNIFFLES, COUGHS.]
Put that mask back on now.
The last thing we can afford is for yours truly to contract whatever kind of nasty infected you with your improper gut handling.
My current theory is that it's either influenza or cryptococcosis and therefore airborne.
If it was of the blood variety, you would've already been dead.
But the fact remains you're packing pathogens that can sting with a sneeze, making it imperative that you maintain your PPE at all times while your meds run their course.
Now hold out your hand.
Feel that.
Primers aren't flush.
The finished rounds pose the deadly risk of slam-firing as soon as they're loaded into the chamber.
Given that this imperfection is readily evident to the touch, I can only assume that this oversight was purely intentional.
No.
I didn't know.
I just wanted to make it so that the bullets didn't work.
I wasn't trying to hurt anyone.
I don't want any of my people to die.
If you cannot accept that we're your people now, you may as well cut to the chase and chew the next bullet coming off that line.
Is that what you want? No.
That's not what I want.
I don't want that.
I don't want to help you.
But I do fear death.
Maybe all this Maybe this is just His way of showing me that I haven't changed a way of showing me that I'm still the same person who locked my parishioners out so long ago.
I'm still the same scared animal, doing what I must to survive just like you.
Being alive may be something we don't have in common for much longer.
You are hereby suspended from the line.
Go find an unobtrusive corner and stow your load and keep your mitts to yourself.
[CRYING.]
And try not to cry too loud.
I want to go outside and test-fire some of these rounds that you didn't compromise with your chicanery.
[DOOR CREAKS.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[WHISTLES.]
Surprised to see me? Shouldn't be.
[CHUCKLES.]
Hell yeah, I'm surprised.
We found your car, and Simon thought that Give me a hand with this, will you? Not gonna lie A real punch in the dick when Rick cornered me in the basement with those decomposing assholes and you fellas never showed up.
Simon thought I want to know what you were thinking.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
See, I want to know if you remember who you are.
This little talk is just between me and you.
Simon's your number two.
I thought you wanted him calling it.
I remember who I am.
I'm Negan.
Good.
That's what I like to hear.
Now do me a favor.
Put that smoke out right there.
See, when the time comes And you will know when it comes I want you to remember this little talk.
I want you to remember what we've done and what we can still do together.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[GROWLING.]
I thought they killed you and that you were gone, like - [FINGERS SNAP.]
- Like that.
I lacked discipline.
And I made it personal.
And that's why I moved things from infection to extermination at the Hilltop.
Yes things went bad.
Though I think it's possible we may have found ourselves in a similar tactical situation, regardless of approach.
We don't know that.
So I'll own it.
I just ask that you give me a pass on this one.
I'll make it up to you.
I promise you that.
[CHUCKLES.]
You know, I remember when I took this place.
[GRUNTS.]
When you helped me take this place.
Wasn't sure I wanted to keep you on board.
I mean, before me, before there was a system in place, what you did, killing all those men, those boys in that settlement so long ago, a lot of people would think that is some psychotic shit.
Like that is the work of a demented, broken, goddamn ghoul.
Like that's not someone that you want to work with, let alone stand next to.
So I figured I'd keep my eye on you.
And I did.
And everything seemed to work out right up until this point.
I'm gonna need you on your knees.
You gonna make a move, or is that it? No move to make.
No.
There isn't.
All is forgiven.
Get your ass up.
We're good.
I won't let you down.
Not you.
I appreciate the hell out of that.
This is where we start The first of our new staging posts.
See, we do not have to take the Hilltop.
We just have to make sure that the farmers can't leave.
We stay nimble.
We stay light.
We plink their asses every time one of them tries to poke their head out.
Sometimes right in front, sometimes from a mile away, but every goddamn time.
[SIGHS.]
Tomorrow afternoon, I am going to take a 10-head team to this spot.
I am stocking it with supplies and ammo that Dr.
Smartypants are making.
Everyone else here is gonna do the same thing, same time, different spot.
End of day tomorrow, we will have cache after cache around that Hilltop and always be spitting distance from a reload.
There will be teams 24/7 around that place snipin' them, one by one, day after day, until we have full attrition.
It's an ambitious plan with testicular heft, I'll give you that.
Very happy to have you back, boss man.
Damn good to be back.
All right, everybody, clear out.
Except for you, Dwight.
Got a few things we need to kick around.
[SIGHS.]
[DOOR CLOSES.]
You are smart as hell.
You know that? I mean, after everything Sherry, the sizzle you didn't stew, you didn't do anything stupid.
You just went about the business of getting yours.
Nothing shook you.
You kept your eyes on what could keep you alive and well.
You keep on keeping that shit clear.
[SIGHS.]
[DOOR OPENS.]
I can't help but suspect that the reason I'm being taken alive is, despite what completely warranted bad blood exists between us, you still harbor a vestigial nostalgia for our erstwhile camaraderie.
And in light of that, I'm willing to just shut my grub flap and give you your space until you see such a time as you're ready to break the ice, one traveling companion Shut your mouth before I cut your tongue out! All right! We got to keep going.
They have to be out looking for him by now.
- Thank you.
I - Shut up.
- Let's go.
- [GRUNTS.]
When I told Negan I made the bullet, it was to save your life.
I didn't think.
I just acted on your behalf.
And I fully expected the crack of the bat to be the last thing I heard, but that didn't happen.
And then I thought they would torture me.
But they didn't.
They gave me a chance to live.
And I tried to resist.
I tried to rise above my biological imperative, but that is not who I am.
I know who you are.
You're the reason they were able to escape the Sanctuary.
Everything that's happened since then, everyone who's died, that's on you.
Rick's the one who pushed us all to take the Saviors on.
He's the one who jumped headlong into this shit-storm with no waders.
[GASPS.]
- [BREATHING HEAVILY.]
- You're selfish, and you're a coward, and you're a traitor.
You turned you back on the only friends you ever had.
Shooting you in the head right here would actually make the world a better place.
But we're not gonna kill you, not because we give a rat's ass about you.
We just need what's in there! We're gonna stick you in the darkest hole we can find, and the only time you'll see the light of day is when we need you to teach us how to do something.
So don't worry You'll get what you want.
You'll live.
But we're gonna force you to do something useful with your pathetic life.
[KNOCK ON DOOR.]
[KNOCK ON DOOR.]
[POUNDING ON DOOR.]
[SCOFFS.]
Meeting went well.
Status quo has been re-achieved.
What'd he hold you back for? You know, a pep talk.
Mm.
We need to talk.
A serious talk with the others who are less than thrilled with the current management, who, like you, engaged in activities said management would frown on.
So this is it? You deliver or get shipped.
He hasn't delivered, and that saddens me.
But the time has come.
Let us gather our like-minded individuals, draw strength from each other and do what we need to do.
Come on.
I gotta sell this to you? Think about everything he's done to you, every little indignity, everything he's extracted from you.
Think about it, Dwight! You know what you have to do.
You have to meet us in the courtyard after rounds, and we begin what's next.
I mean, Jesus, right? Right.
Yes, my boy.
Yes.
[DOOR OPENS, CLOSES.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
They must've heard us pull up.
I got it.
- Watch him.
- [GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[BODY THUDS.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[CROSSBOW FIRES, BODY THUDS.]
[GAGS.]
Shit.
[GRUNTING.]
[GUNSHOTS.]
He couldn't have got far.
Come on.
We can't let him get back to them! If you see him, blow that pig's head off! [GRUNTING.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[WALKER GROWLING.]
[GRUNTING.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[GRUNTING.]
[GRUNTING.]
[PANTING.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
Oh, God.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[GRUNTING.]
Aah! [GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[GRUNTS.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[BRANCH THUDDING.]
[PANTING.]
RACHEL: Is he dead? [THUNDER RUMBLES.]
You You blamed Enid for Natania's death.
But it's really the Saviors.
What they did to you, what they turned you into it's their fault.
You hide.
You don't trust.
You don't live the life the way you want to because of them.
They hurt you, and they're gonna keep on hurting you.
Unless you do one thing! Fight.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[DOOR OPENS.]
Hey.
Some shit, huh? Yeah.
Got to think, uh you wanted this before we did.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
If you're here right now, you're in.
We can talk about approaches and finesses, but you are in.
No takebacks.
We need to make this quick, quiet, and respectful.
Man's done a lot for us.
He deserves that.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
You have some legitimate personal issues with the man.
The kill is yours if you want it.
Something quiet.
I mean, not a knife.
[CHUCKLES.]
Can't make it that personal.
A silencer.
We call a meeting.
And that's it.
The next order of business is to set the break, to start the healing.
The catalyzing event to facilitate that is the destruction of the Hilltop and its residents.
We'll make it a monument of compliance.
Sorry, Gregory.
And then we get on with our lives.
Right, Dwight? [GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[NEGAN WHISTLES.]
[SIGHS.]
Thank you, D.
I'll take it from here.
Three two one.
[SILENCED GUNSHOTS.]
Dwight! [GROANS.]
Now there is the Simon that I know.
He comes right at you instead of that backstabby bullshit.
Why? After everything he did to you, huh? Why do this? He'd win.
You killed all the garbage people, Simon.
[LUCILLE THUDS.]
[GRUNTS.]
After I specifically told you not to do that shit.
[GRUNTS, LUCILLE THUDS.]
But after all this, and me being me I'm still gonna give you your shot.
You want to be the man, you got to beat the man.
If you can do that then, hell you should be the man.
SIMON: Everyone! After this is done, we get to work.
Just know that I didn't want this.
But the Sanctuary must stand.
This is not the man to prosecute this conflict.
Just wanted to say a grateful enclave thanks you! [GRUNTS.]
[BOTH GRUNTING.]
[PUNCHES LANDING.]
[BOTH GRUNTING.]
[GROANS.]
[BOTH GRUNTING.]
You need to get out of here now.
No shit.
Give this to Rick and tell him about tomorrow.
It's the only move you got.
I left a car for you behind the coal chutes.
Go.
You went for it all at the Hilltop.
You got Saviors killed, and then you ran away like a coward! You got shown up one too many times.
Those people, they are always gonna know that there's a loophole, a way to skate.
They are always gonna be looking for that chance to push back, so now I gotta kill all of 'em just like I'm gonna kill you! [CHOKING.]
[WINDPIPE CRACKS.]
[GRUNTS.]
[PANTING.]
What an asshole.
[CHAINS RATTLING, LOCK CLICKS.]
What're we gonna do? Such a damn shame A waste Slinking behind my back like some kind of dickless worm.
Planning on killing me Like, what else am I gonna do besides crush the guy's throat? Yeah.
Eh, you know, what's bad for Simon, it's good for you.
And I know we've had our ups and downs, D, but I've always been able to count on you.
So congratulations.
You are my new right-hand man.
That is, if you accept the promotion.
I do.
And I'll help you finish this thing with Rick.
Don't sell yourself short, D.
You already have.
Well, you look surprised, Dwight.
Yeah, see, I found her on the side of the road.
Laura, why don't you tell D what you told me? That night in Alexandria, he turned on us.
He killed our team.
I ran, and I kept on running.
I was hurt.
But what kept me alive was the thought of getting back here and exposing you for the scum weasel you are.
[CHUCKLES.]
It all makes sense now.
You told Rick when to attack.
How to get to the outposts You keep us locked in here, slipping them workers guns.
Maybe you even lied to me about killing Sherry.
Oh, hell.
You, for sure, lied to me about that.
So, what? Hmm? You think you're some sort of a [INHALES SHARPLY.]
hero? No.
You are nothing.
A nobody in way over your head.
But when I said that you would come through for me when I needed it, oh, I meant that 110%.
See, I knew that I could count on you to deliver my plan to Rick, my brilliant, if I do say so myself, fake-ass plan.
[SIGHS.]
You used Gregory for that, right? I mean, I was thinking maybe you'd take some kind of field trip or something, but no, you got yourself a little delivery boy.
Good for you.
To deliver all that intel to Rick and the piss patrol that's gonna lead them directly into the line of fire.
They are not gonna know what hit 'em, all thanks to my new right-hand man.
[LIPS SQUEAK.]
Now, see, I I thought about killing you, and then [INHALES SHARPLY.]
I thought maybe that'd be too dignified for a backstabbing, double-crossing dirtbag such as yourself.
No, Dwighty boy, I got plans for you.
[CHUCKLES.]
[TOOLS CLANGING.]
What the hell happened? We need preparations to defend this place in case of another incursion.
We've established a perimeter.
We just got a message from the Sanctuary.
Negan's back, and he has plans to finish the Hilltop.
Rick's walking into a trap.
We'll need that bullet order filled by tomorrow morning.
Kindly convey to Negan my personal congratulations on the occasion of his return, and assure him that his request will be fulfilled in its entirety and on time.
That's right.
If Negan needs bullets to end this war, then, by ginger, he's gonna get 'em.
All of 'em.
Scotch my talk of a bare minimum.
No, sirs and madams, we shall rise to the occasion with the ammunition.
We will blow them away with every trigger pull they require.
We shall, we will.
Oh, trip not, colleagues.
We will change Savior history evermore.
Gabriel.
It's all hands on deck, and yours are sorting shells.
Listen, you follow my lead to the letter on the lead, or you can cry and die.
[FIST POUNDS.]
Here we go.
Time to do something useful with our pathetic lives.
[SIMON GROWLING.]
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
MICHONNE: Negan, it's Michonne.
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- I'll wait.
The one with the dreads, the sword? Is that you? Rick there with you? Why don't you put him on? [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
This isn't about Rick.
It's about Carl.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
He wrote you a letter.
And I'm delivering it because that's what he wanted.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
Well, I can't promise not to kill the messenger.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
Just shut up and listen.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
"Negan, this is Carl.
" "I was helping someone.
I got bit.
We didn't even have to be doing what we were doing.
I was just helping someone.
Now I'm gone.
You might be gone.
Maybe my Dad made your people give you up and he killed you, but I don't think so.
I think you're still around and you're working on a way out.
Maybe you got out.
Maybe you think we're a lost cause and you just want to kill all of us.
I think you think you have to be who you are.
I just wonder if this is what you wanted.
I wanted to ask you.
I wish I could've.
Maybe you'll beat us.
And if you do, there'll just be someone else to fight.
The way out is working together.
It's forgiveness.
" "It's believing that it doesn't have to be a fight anymore.
"Because it doesn't.
"I hope my dad offers you peace.
I hope you take it.
I hope everything can change.
It did for me.
Start over.
You still can.
Carl.
" [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
All this there is no getting out of it now.
I wouldn't accept your surrender if you came to me on your knees.
See, winning isn't about beating you.
Winning is about killing every last one of you.
That is starting over.
I never wanted this.
Rick made this happen.
You tell him that.
No more talk.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
