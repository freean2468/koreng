1 Previously on AMC's "The Walking Dead" Hit a few, leave 'em livin', let 'em turn.
But don't kill 'em.
ALDEN: You already screwed up once.
I'm not gonna let you get us all killed.
My people come first.
SIMON: Just 'cause he walked away doesn't mean he's breathing.
We can keep looking, maybe find him more alive than dead, but then what? Or we could walk away.
[GURGLING.]
[EXHALES SHARPLY.]
You know what it is.
You were supposed to.
No.
You were supposed to! No! [INSECTS, BIRDS CHIRPING.]
[HORN BLARING IN DISTANCE.]
[HORN HONKS.]
[HORN HONKS.]
[BLARING CONTINUES.]
[HORN HONKS.]
[AIR HORN BLOWS.]
It's on.
[INDISTINCT CHATTER.]
Can I have that for when they come? This is not your lot.
You will stay inside, young Henry, with the others till it's done.
But I need to help.
I need to fight.
No.
You do not.
You need to stay inside and guard this place.
You will live and help others do the same.
Carol.
You know I can help.
Henry, if you go out there during the attack, you'll die.
Protect them.
[HAMMER POUNDING IN DISTANCE.]
Not there.
Those go in the corner.
What'd you say your specialty was? I was a second year EM resident at So you have never performed surgery.
Three times.
Amputations? No, but I can figure it out.
Are you even strong enough to hold someone down who hasn't been anesthetized? [EXHALES SHARPLY.]
I can figure it out.
DANA: Can you shoot a gun? More importantly, can you shoot a gun while you're holding someone down? I'm pretty sure I know enough to [CHUCKLING.]
Really? 'Cause it sounds to me like you don't know enough of anything.
And in my experience, people who don't know enough are more dangerous than people who don't know shit.
There's a lot I haven't done, I know that, but from my first day at the hospital to this moment right now, all I've done are things I've never done.
There are people coming, right now, to hurt this place, and I'm standing here ready to help.
So stop asking me what I've done and start telling me what to do besides where to put the damn blankets.
I like you.
Get ready.
Here we go.
[ENGINES RUMBLING.]
[BRAKES SQUEAL.]
[VEHICLE DOORS OPEN, CLOSE.]
SIMON: Here I was hoping to give that gate a big ol' wet, sloppy kiss, and there she goes, playing hard to get.
Arat, Gary, remove these offending articles from the road.
The sun is down.
I'm tired of waiting.
MAGGIE ON WALKIE TALKIE: Negan.
I want to talk to Negan.
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- Well, hello there.
You are speaking to Negan, but my birth certificate says "Simon.
" With whom do I have the distinct displeasure of speaking? - [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- Maggie.
Maggie Rhee.
The Widow.
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- Well, then.
Hello again, Widow Rhee, and allow me to offer my condolences.
For what's happened and what's about to happen.
In case it's not already plain as Hilltop potatoes, yours truly is speaking on behalf of Negan this go 'round.
And I assure you that the man himself personally received your care package next day delivery.
I noticed it was the box that I gave you in good faith Trick's on me.
But the bill's come due, and you and your people are gonna have to pay.
Quite dearly, I'm afraid.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
Your 38 people are alive and breathing.
Turn around and leave us be, and they stay that way.
But if you don't, I have 38 bullets that I will personally fire into all 38.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
It's too nice a night to spend it dyin' slow, don't you think, Simon? [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
[SIGHS.]
How's this gonna go? [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
Well, Maggie Rhee, this is highly regrettable, but the way I see it, the Saviors you're in possession of there are damaged goods.
You know, they've got themselves into their own pickle, and this organization prizes those who, "A," avoid capture and, "B," figure out their own shit when said outcome eventuates.
Which, in the end, is my way of saying screw them.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
Did you really think that cockamamie play would work? It will.
Alright, people.
Let's get this party started.
And though we do not come bearing munitions, remember The plan has changed.
Our goal is not merely infection it is conclusion.
We are doing away with these people.
All of 'em.
This isn't what he'd want.
[VEHICLE DOOR OPENS.]
You know that, right? He could still be out there.
[VEHICLE DOOR CLOSES.]
You sure you wanna face that with him if he shows? Better to beg forgiveness than ask permission, D.
Future problems.
[VEHICLE APPROACHES.]
[GUNFIRE.]
SIMON: Go! Through the gate before the assholes close it! Now! [GUNFIRE.]
[GROANS.]
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
Boys in back, light 'em up! Ohh! Take the prisoners to my office.
Hold 'em there 'til it's done.
- Let's go.
- Go.
Inside! Get inside! I can help you defend this place.
I want to.
Please, Maggie.
You think I got a reason to be loyal to these people? Maggie you coming? Where the hell is he? Lookouts, fall back! Front line, give 'em cover! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
Ohh! [GROANS.]
[GRUNTING.]
Ohh! [GRUNTS.]
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING IN DISTANCE.]
Long time, no see.
It's okay.
I'm here.
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
I'll take out sunshine around the corner.
- Unless you want her, D.
- No.
Well, how 'bout the next one, then? I'm gonna need a group effort here.
Go.
I'll stay with him.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
Tara! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
[BULLETS RICOCHETING.]
[GLASS SHATTERS.]
MICHONNE: Daryl, it's time.
Maggie gave the signal.
We gotta go.
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
Daryl! [GLASS SHATTERS.]
[GUNFIRE STOPS.]
SIMON: I can't see shit.
[INSECTS CHIRPING.]
These people have run before.
Arat, take a team around back.
I want the place surrounded.
Gary, your group goes for the trailers.
- Slow and quiet, capiche? - Yeah.
The rest of us? The rest of us are making a house call.
Well, if anybody's home it's time to do some proper slaughtering.
[WHISTLING.]
[WHISTLING CONTINUES.]
[GUNFIRE.]
God damn it, no! Back to the trucks! Go! Go! Go! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING.]
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
[GUN CLICKING.]
MAN: Move! Move! Keep moving! [BODY THUDS.]
[GRUNTS.]
[GRUNTS.]
[GASPS.]
Just stay down.
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
[BODY THUDS.]
You know what it is.
[GUNFIRE CONTINUES.]
You know what it is! [ENGINE STARTS.]
[GUN CLICKS.]
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
I wanted them dead.
All of them.
Negan most of all.
Yeah.
Me too.
Did you see him? He wasn't here.
I saw him out there.
I broke away and tried to kill him.
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
I didn't, but I tried.
[SNIFFLES.]
Thank you.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
We don't have the resources to fight off another attack.
Be ready to go.
Hey.
You shouldn't be out here.
Oh, it's just It's just a scratch.
I can help.
What if it wasn't? Then it'd be my own damn fault.
He's back with them because of me.
No, he's back with 'em 'cause that's who he is.
We We got lucky.
Finding Maggie Rick.
It could've been different.
It was, for me, when I was with the Governor.
Yeah, but you weren't one of 'em.
But I was with them.
Your brother, too.
My brother? My brother ran the wrong way his whole life.
If he were here, if I stuck with him when he left, we'd be with the Saviors, too, or some other group just like 'em.
But I'd have figured out who they were just like you did.
Maybe that's what happened to Dwight.
Is that before or after he killed your girl? Or is that all square now? It is.
Look, I might hate him forever, but he saved my life.
No, he tried to kill you last night.
When we were in the woods, when we were coming here, I saw him try and help us win.
Yeah.
I saw what I saw, too.
[WOOD CREAKS.]
[BOARDS CLATTER.]
[BOARD CREAKS.]
Saved you this turnip.
Yeah.
I'm okay.
[BOARD CREAKING.]
[GRUNTS.]
[SIGHS.]
[BOARD THUDS.]
Rick Maggie turned off the generators to save on gas.
The kids are gonna need air in this heat.
[WOOD CREAKS.]
[BOARD THUDS.]
Can I take a look at that cut? I have some stuff to clean it.
Let me get this done first.
[BOARD THUDS.]
I saw him at the back of the convoy.
That's why I did it.
[SIGHS.]
I had to try.
I had to.
[BOARD CLATTERS.]
[INDISTINCT CHATTER.]
[HAMMER POUNDING.]
We can get you outside the gates with a guard.
So you can bury your people.
They're not mine.
But I'm glad you see them that way.
As people.
[VEHICLE DOOR OPENS, CLOSES.]
[ENGINE STARTS.]
What is it? Just you're a good leader.
I knew it before, but last night You saved the gates.
You saved the community.
You saved lives.
Because they sacrificed theirs.
I only saved the prisoners 'cause Negan is still in play.
Which means they could be.
I sent Negan that body in the box to make him mad.
To lure him here.
'Cause I wanted my husband's grave to be the last thing he saw.
Even if it came at a cost.
I don't know if that makes me a good leader.
I do know that the only regret I have is that Negan is not in that pile of bodies.
CAROL: You had me worried.
Well if I'd known getting stabbed would get your attention, I would've done it a lot sooner.
[CHUCKLES.]
[GLASS THUDS.]
I'm sorry for how I left.
What I did to you.
I don't need an apology.
[SIGHS.]
You don't owe me anything.
But, uh, I guess I have been wondering why.
Uh Was any of it real? I didn't want it to be real.
I was pretending.
Well, don't go easy on me here.
I was trying to live a life.
Then we found out that we hadn't gotten rid of the Saviors.
And that there would be more fighting and more dying.
And I couldn't.
And it was right about the time that it felt like Like like maybe it wasn't like maybe it wasn't going to be pretending anymore.
Maybe.
Well that just might be one of the nicest things anybody's ever said to me.
I'm sorry.
[COUGHS.]
You gonna leave again? After it's over? I don't know.
I think I might just accept that some of us are lucky enough to just live, some of us are lucky enough to just fight.
Even after it ends? I don't think it ends.
What we're doing The end of the fight is Is what we're fighting for.
Winning just means we get tomorrow.
CAROL: Maybe one more night.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
Maybe one more morning.
After that no guarantees.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS.]
[CLOCK TICKING.]
HENRY: I wouldn't have died if I went out there.
CAROL: You would have, Henry.
Just trust me You would have.
I could treat your wound.
Wouldn't want it to get infected.
There's, um a prayer for the dead I first heard when I was a little boy.
It, uh ended with the phrase, "Do not send us astray after 'them'" - Those who died - Don't.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
[MAN COUGHS.]
How you feeling? [SIGHS.]
I'm okay.
Siddiq and Dr.
Dana, they're they're good.
Didn't even feel 'em stitching me up.
We're lucky to have 'em.
We're lucky to have you.
If Gregory was in charge, this this place wouldn't be here anymore.
He was about himself.
What he wanted.
That's not you.
[GROANS LIGHTLY.]
[BREATH RATTLES.]

[FENCE RATTLES.]
Let me out.
Do you know which one killed my brother? I-I don't know who your brother is.
I-I don't know any of these people.
I'm not one of them.
That's a very dangerous weapon you got there, kiddo.
Uh, I don't want you to get hurt I don't want anyone to get hurt.
Why don't you give it to me, and we can talk, huh? I'm sorry about your brother.
Killing them isn't gonna bring him back.
No.
But it'll make me feel better.
It already did once.
And why would you be in here if you're not with them? I'm not dumb.
One of you knows who killed Ben, and if I have to, I'm gonna start shooting people until someone tells me.
Hey, kid.
I get it.
My My big brother died, too.
Killing a buncha guys who mighta had something to do with it sounds pretty damn good in theory.
But it's not gonna make you feel any better.
Not for long.
I know.
- What's up, Al? - Nothing.
Go back to sleep.

[CHAIN THUDS.]
[GATE CREAKS.]
I want the guy who killed my brother.
Somebody better tell me now! Look, I know you're angry.
Okay? I know.
I was, too.
But words are a lot easier t-to live with than actions, all right? Be a man and step forward so I don't have to kill your friends.
I'm gonna count to 10 and start shooting.
1 2 3 - [WALKER GROWLING.]
- 4 5 [SCREAMS.]
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING.]
[GRUNTS.]
Gate's open, boys! Let's go! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[FLESH TEARS.]
[BODY THUDS.]
The hell happened? I don't know.
Maybe walkers got in.
Maybe during the fight.
These are our own people, though.
[GROWLING.]
[SCREAMING.]
Stay back! [GROWLING FADES.]
[FLESH TEARS.]
[BODY THUDS.]
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
You alright? Yeah, just He wasn't bit.
But he turned.
Negan's bat.
When I was out there with him, it was covered in walker blood.
I just thought he'd crossed some.
But maybe They have us working for them again.
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
Killin' our own.
BRUCE: It's the fever.
That's what it is.
It makes sense now.
[VOICE BREAKING.]
One of you you're gonna have to do it.
[BREATHING HEAVILY.]
I can't.
You gotta do it for me.
Please.
Please.
[SNIFFLING.]
[DOOR CREAKS.]
Hey.
Good out there? House is clear.
How'd this happen? [DOOR CLOSES.]
[SIGHS.]
Um the Saviors did something to their weapons.
Everyone they cut up or got shot they all got sick.
Some of 'em turned.
What? No.
Okay.
When we were out there, and you said you were done waiting, I coulda killed him.
I shoulda.
No.
He wanted to be here with us.
And no matter what he did or how hard he tried, I wanted him dead.
I just couldn't let it be anything else.
Karma's a bitch, right? [WALKERS GROWLING.]
Hands up, now! Hey, we're trying to help! A-A-A kid came and opened up the pen.
We had people turn.
A bunch of 'em left, but a bunch of 'em are trying to close that gate.
Maggie, look.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
Dianne.
- We're on it.
- Come on.
What are you doing out here? I went to check on the prisoners, but the pen was empty.
Where are the others? ALDEN: They didn't say where they were goin'.
They just ran.
And you didn't? You saw what we mean to Negan and Simon.
Which might be a dumb thing to say It doesn't make us worth much to your people, either, but those of us that stayed, stayed.
We had plenty of chances to run.
Henry! Henry, if you're down here, come on out! Yo.
We've checked everywhere.
The little man's gone.
Hey.
Some of the Saviors said Henry broke into the pen, just before the others escaped.
He was down there, and then he wasn't.
I told him I told him what would happen.
GAVIN: You know what it is.
You know what it is.
Mnh.
You know what it is.
- You know what it is! - [GRUNTS.]
You know what it is.
You know what it is! [ECHOING.]
You know! [SHOVELS SCRAPING.]
What is it? The cost.
