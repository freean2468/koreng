1 Previously on AMC's "The Walking Dead" - We have a deal? - We have, yes.
I got this.
[GUNSHOT.]
Leave it where they'll find it.
Drop it now! GIRL: Grandma? [CRYING.]
I have to do this.
Me.
[SILENCED GUNSHOT.]

[SIGHS.]
[CRYING SOFTLY.]
[SIGHS.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[DOOR CREAKS.]
Hey.
We got to go.
[DOOR CREAKS.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
Hey.
He used to sit on the roof.
We have to go.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
Michonne! [WALKERS GROWLING.]
Michonne.
Michonne! [GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[ENGINE STARTS.]
[TIRES SCREECH.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[SIGHS.]
What do you think he meant? Did he want us to stop fighting the Saviors? Just surrender to Negan? We could pull over.
We could read what he wrote.
No.
Not yet.
Not me.
[SNIFFLES.]
Rick.
[BREATHES SHARPLY.]
He Carl He wrote a letter to Negan.
I need to talk to Jadis.
What? They have weapons people.
We can't just give that up.
Why now? They went with me to the Sanctuary.
The Saviors saw us there.
They're gonna be a target, too.
We still need them.
They're ours, not theirs.
[INSECTS CHIRPING.]
[LEAVES RUSTLING.]
[DOOR CREAKS.]
[CLATTERING.]
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
Dammit.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
Hilltop is covered.
The roads and then some.
They are out there somewhere, so let's get balls deep in every nook and cranny they might hole up in.
Nooks, crannies, and holes, people.
All that shit outside the box.
[STATIC CRACKLES, CLICKS.]
Appears our friends at Alexandria had themselves an escape plan.
Rick's little one-eyed pride and joy played me.
Damn.
That kid That kid is built for this shit.
Let me go out and close this thing.
Arat's got it for now.
How'd the Hilltop go? As requested.
Good job.
With an extra attaboy on top given I know you didn't want to play it that way.
You hear anything from Gavin? Not yet, but it's coming.
Gavin may be perpetually pissed off, but he keeps his shit dry and tight.
If I'm not running down Rick and company, where do you want me? [SIGHS.]
[CHAIR SCRAPES.]
Garbage people.
Good.
Eliminating those who reneged might leave us a tad short on ammo, but it's worth it.
[CHAIR CREAKS SOFTLY.]
I need you to hear me on this, Simon.
Those piss-stained double-crossers may have pulled a triple cross, but it doesn't change the fact that they are still a resource.
So you're gonna choke back whatever shit is stirring up inside you and remind them that a deal with the Saviors is a lock, stock, suck my barrel deal.
Deliver the standard message, take one out, and the rest will fall in line.
Just one, Simon.
If you've got something to say say it.
Maybe we should cut our losses here.
These people can't learn the lesson, no matter how many times we teach it.
Alexandria, Hilltop, Kingdom, these garbage rats they're not seeming to understand the situation.
Not one little bit.
So maybe we learn our lesson, scrape the plates into the trash.
Move further out.
Find other communities to "save.
" [CHUCKLES.]
Oh, I am doing my best to hold it together right now.
You wanna cut your losses, take your own advice.
Killing everybody to solve the problem that is the easy way, not our way.
What we do saving people, it is hard.
But it damn well works.
Not lately.
Once I clip Rick, everything's aces again, Simon.
[KNOCK ON DOOR.]
Yeah? [DOOR CREAKS OPEN.]
[WALKER GROWLING.]
What the hell is that? A delivery from the Hilltop.
I brought you something to deal with it.
It's charged.
Out.
[GROWLING CONTINUES, THUMPING.]
[DOOR CREAKS SHUT.]
[GROWLING, THUMPING.]
[WOOD CREAKING.]
NEGAN: Little bit more.
[GROWLING.]
[NAIL GUN FIRING.]
[GROWLING STOPS.]
That's Dean.
That means the other "38" that the Hilltop are holding are from the Satellite Outpost.
Those are my people.
I'm gonna kill every last one of those farmers! You will do exactly what I asked.
We can't let 'em get away with this shit.
[POUNDS TABLE.]
You will do your job! AARON: We came here to ask for your help.
Well, you shouldn't have.
[DOOR CREAKS.]
Hey.
Please.
Just - Please.
Just - [HANDCUFFS CLICKING.]
Let's talk about this.
Natania was your family.
It's up to you, Cyndie.
All of it.
We should just kill them.
[DOOR CREAKS.]
[LOCK CLICKS.]
We're gonna get out of this.
[VOICE BREAKING.]
This is It's not about that.
She made it so I had to do it.
She made me kill her.
I'd do it again.
I'd have to.
Even knowing it would feel this way.
[DOOR CREAKS OPEN.]
[HANDCUFFS CLICKING.]
Thank you.
[HANDCUFFS CLICKING.]
Take them to the beach.
- You're going to kill us? - Take them.
This is your decision.
You own it.
ENID: Cyndie.
You better have a good reason for killing us other than thinking it'll make you feel better.
Because it won't.
Let's just get it over with.
ENID: Why would you kill us? To punish us? I mean, don't you get it? Killing is the punishment.
You execute us, then maybe some of ours will come looking for us.
And maybe you'll take them out, but eventually, enough of them will come back and they will wipe you out.
Your grandmother got herself killed, so don't make the same mistake.
Just let us go [BREATHES SHARPLY.]
and we'll keep fighting them and you can keep hiding.
No.
They live.
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
If we win, do you even want to know? Yes.
Then help us win.
We're helping you win by not killing you both.
That's our contribution to the cause.
You've taken everything else we could give.
[BIRDS CHIRPING, SQUAWKING.]
Don't come here again.
Stop trying to kill strangers.
We know who we have to kill.
We know the difference between friends and enemies.
You should, too.
Don't come back.
[INSECTS CHIRPING.]
You know how to get to the car? Yeah.
Good.
No.
Aaron, they're not gonna help us.
I want to go home.
I do, more than anything.
But I can't leave.
Not until they join the fight.
They're not joining.
Beatrice and Kathy were open to fighting before.
I think I can convince them.
I just need time.
Okay, then we both stay.
You need to get back.
Tell Maggie what's happening, what I'm doing and you need to tell her not to come.
They'll kill you if you go back there.
I won't go back there.
It'll be okay.
No matter what happens, I'll be okay.
Promise me I'll see you again.
Promise.
Promise me you'll be okay.
[WHISPERING.]
Go.
[FOOTSTEPS DEPART.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
So we lighting up the Hilltop? Gonna sit on our dicks a mite more.
Alas, we're going to the landfill.
No worries, Gary.
Not a single one in the world.
[WHISTLES.]
[INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS.]
[DOOR CREAKING.]
[FOOTSTEPS.]
[WEAPONS COCKING.]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nellie! Everybody keep their horses inside the gate! After all, we're friends.
Right? Now that that's out of the way, let's get down to the brass tacks.
Bottom line, I'm gonna need an apology.
The genuine article.
Now, I know you had your little side deal with Rick.
You came to our home, pretty much arm in arm.
This despite the pre-existing arrangement with us.
Now you know we saw you, because we tried to kill you.
So [SIGHS.]
you've had plenty of time to prepare something.
[CLICKS TONGUE.]
A heartfelt act of confession, I hope.
[SUCKS TEETH.]
Feel free to refer to any notes you may have prepared.
No deal with Rick.
Delivered him.
Brought to you.
But you shot.
Bull-shit! [INHALES DEEPLY.]
But no need to worry.
[CHUCKLES.]
'Cause you caught yourself a break a big ol' break, if you ask me.
Negan is graciously willing to forgo any punishment, provided you agree to revert to the agreed-upon terms of our deal.
You do that all is forgiven.
That's some crazy good luck, right? [SUCKS TEETH.]
However, we will be taking all your guns and ammunition.
Not our deal.
No, it isn't.
But we currently have a need.
And as friends, you will grant us this neighborly gesture as a sign of good faith.
Dangers everywhere.
Need guns, too.
Not when you got us.
And if and when the time comes for you to have guns, the Saviors will provide them for you.
Spit-shined, ready to go.
[SCAVENGERS MURMURING.]
Thank you.
[INHALES DEEPLY.]
[WHISTLES.]
Mm! Is this you? It's not bad.
You learn before or after? Don't learn.
This? Come to know.
Oh.
Why the dump? [SCOFFS.]
I mean, there had to be a better place to call home.
Our place.
Ours.
What's the deal with the helipad in back? The solar panels? What was this place? A dump.
[CHUCKLES.]
[CHUCKLES.]
I want to know if you know.
You have guns.
We have deal? It occurs to me that I've not yet received the full definition of an apology.
I feel like I've gotten some transgressional acknowledgment, the guns certainly cover restitution.
But what I'm not yet feeling is the remorse.
There is remorse.
[GUNSHOT.]
[BODY THUDS.]
[SCAVENGERS MURMURING.]
There is remorse.
No! [GUNSHOT, SCAVENGERS SCREAMING.]
Say it again! [BOTH GRUNT.]
There is remorse, you son of a bitch! [CHUCKLES.]
Ohhh.
No, no, no.
[LAUGHS.]
Ohh! Ah.
I don't think you mean that.
Light it up, gents.
[ALL MURMURING.]
Light it up now! [SCAVENGERS SCREAMING, GUNFIRE.]
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING.]
[ENGINE RUMBLING.]
[BRAKES SQUEAL.]
[ENGINE SHUTS OFF.]
[ENGINES RUMBLING.]
[BRAKES SQUEAL.]
Got it done? That and then some.
[DOOR CREAKS OPEN.]
You good? Nothing on Gavin.
Want me to turn back around, roll out, end the mystery? [SIGHS.]
I already sent a team out there.
Ah.
Well, I'm sure he's A-okay.
And if not, we'll just send another message.
So, tell me how it went.
Standard message and delivery.
Showed 'em and told 'em.
[SNIFFS.]
There was remorse.
D.
J.
: Negan.
Yeah.
What is it? It's Rick.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[GUNSHOTS.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[GUNSHOTS.]
Come on! Rick.
What happened here? The Saviors.
Well, how do we get out? Get out how you got in.
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
These weren't heaps before.
It was just trash laid out, as far as the eye could see.
I used to come here to find things to paint on.
Metal sheets.
Fabrics.
And then after everything changed [VOICE BREAKING.]
I realized this whole place was a canvas.
That we were the paint.
We could create something new.
We could become something new.
We did.
This was our world.
Apart from everyone else.
In every way.
You did this.
This is because of you.
[METAL CREAKS.]
[METAL CREAKING.]
What are you doing? We're gonna run for it.
Let me come with you.
Just until they're gone.
Nah.
I'm done with her games.
She can't help us, anyway.
Come on.
[WALKERS GROWLING.]
[THUDDING.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
[GUNSHOTS.]
[THUDDING.]
[GRUNTING.]
[GROWLS.]
[GUNSHOTS.]
[GROWLING CONTINUES.]
Wait! Please! Just Just let me get out! [GUNSHOT.]

I shot above her head.
I just wanted her gone.
[SIGHS.]
Look, I saw her.
She made it.
She ran into an empty alley just before I left.
I didn't want her dead.
I just wanted her gone.
Feels like what Carl was talking about.
What we should do when we have a choice.
[BRAKES SQUEAL.]
[SIGHS.]
Uh Um I need a se I need a second.
It's fine.
[SEAT CREAKS.]

[SNIFFLES, SIGHS.]
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- Get me Negan.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
D.
J.
: Who the hell is asking? [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
It's Rick Grimes.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- NEGAN: Ricky.
Look at you, callin' me up.
You wanna tell me where you are so we can do this face-to-face? [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
Carl's dead.
He wrote letters.
He wrote one to you.
He asked you to stop.
He asked me to stop.
He asked us for peace.
But it's too late for that.
Even if we wanted a deal now, it doesn't matter.
I'm gonna kill you.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- How did it happen? [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- What? - [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- How did he die? Was it us? Was it the grenades? The fire? - [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- It wasn't you.
Carl went out to help someone.
And he got bit.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
God damn it.
Shit.
I, um I am sorry.
You know, I wanted him to be part of things.
I had plans.
He That kid That kid was the future.
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- The only future is one where you're dead.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- What the hell are you doing, Rick? Why are you fighting? Why are you making this so hard? Carl is dead because of you.
Because you couldn't leave shit well enough alone.
I mean, hell, maybe he woulda died some other way.
Any one of us can get our ticket punched at any second.
but in this case in this case he is dead because of you.
Because you weren't there to stop him from doing something stupid.
You set this course, Rick.
Who's next? - [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- You are.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- [WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
- No.
But someone is.
You see, I stop people from dying.
I am the answer.
Now, it may have taken a hard lesson for you to hear it, but you should hear it now.
It's time.
Do not let any more of your shit decisions cost you to lose anyone else you love.
That garbage that sticks with you.
Forever.
[SIGHS.]
Just like Carl will.
Hell, I'm feeling it.
And I'm gonna be feeling it for a while.
You could have just let me save all of you.
I mean, that's why I killed your friends in the first place.
So, you can sit there and you can say that you're gonna kill me, but you won't.
You failed.
You failed as a leader, and most of all, Rick, you failed as a father.
[SIGHS.]
Just give up.
Give up, because you have already lost.
[WALKIE-TALKIE CLICKS.]
