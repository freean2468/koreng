1 I'm gonna kill you.
[Roars.]
[People screaming.]
[Man groaning.]
Now! Go! Go! Go! We got your back! [Gunfire.]
We are going to war! All: Yes, sir! [Birds chirping.]
["Weird Al" Yankovic's "Another One Rides the Bus" plays in distance.]
[Rhythmic clapping.]
Riding in the bus down the boulevard And the place was pretty packed Yeah! Couldn't find a seat, so I had to stand With the perverts in the back It was smelling like a locker room [Insects chirping.]
[Birds chirping.]
[Hammer clanging.]
[Indistinct conversations.]
[Clanging continues.]
[Conversations continue.]
[Air hissing.]
10:28.
When I first met him Jesus said that my world was gonna get a whole lot bigger.
Well, we found that world.
We found each other.
That"bigger world" is ours by right.
That we've come together for it, all of us it's that much more true -- it's ours by right.
[Walkers growling in distance.]
Any person who would live in peace and fairness, who would find common ground it's their right, too.
[Walkers growling in distance.]
Down.
But those who use and take and kill to carve out the world and make it theirs alone -- we end them.
We don'tcelebrate it.
We don't have shame about it, either.
There's only one person who has to die and I will kill him myself.
I will.
I will.
[Walkers growling in distance.]
[Pen clicks.]
[Growling continues.]
[Arrow fires.]
But if it's the others the others who prop him up, stand by his side, even those who just look the other way -- so be it.
10:28.
[Walkers growling in distance.]
Then we keep making the world bigger.
Together.
Ezekiel: Together.
Bound forever! To quote The Bard, "For he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.
" For she today my sister.
[Shiva roars.]
Maggie: We've practiced.
We've been through it over and over again.
We all know the plan doesn't end this morning.
That we may have to live in uncertainty for days, maybe more.
That we have to keep our faith in each other.
If we can hold on to that with everything we have, the future is ours.
The world is ours.
[Walkers growling loudly in distance.]
Another one rides the bus Another one rides the bus And another comes on and another comes on Another one rides the bus Hey, who's gonna sit by you? Another one rides the bus There's a suitcase poking me in the ribs There's an elbow in my ear There's a smelly old bum standing next to me Hasn't showered in a year Well, I think I'm missing a contact lens And I think my wallet's gone And I think this bus is stopping again To let a couple more freaks get on, look out! [Mid-tempo music plays.]
[Insects chirping.]
[Brakes squeal.]
[Engine shuts off.]
[Door creaks.]
[Chirping continues.]
[Birds chirping.]
Man: Hi.
[Can clatters.]
Yeah.
I-I'm okay.
I mean I'm not, but I've been shot at.
Someone threw a microwave at me.
So I-I'm just gonna say something my mom used to say and hope for the best here.
"Whatever you have of good, spend on the traveler.
" My mom said that -- that helping the traveler, the person without a home -- that's everything.
I'm sure you've seen things, been through things, that you don't trust people.
I get it.
I get it.
I don't, either.
I've been through things, too.
My mom -- she also said that, "May my mercy prevail over my wrath.
" [Scoffs.]
It's not all my mom.
That -- That one -- That's from the Quran.
Probably shouldn't have said that.
I don't even know you, but I ha-- I haven't eaten in a few days.
You might not even be real.
Hands up.
Listen.
I'm gone.
Huh? It's cool.
I just -- I just wanted some -- e-even just some food.
[Gunshots.]
We were supposed to meet at the intersection.
I shot over his head.
I just wanted him gone.
He said that he was -- I heard what he said.
Most of it.
But he could've been one of them.
Like a spy? [Gun drops in holster.]
I shot above his head.
If he isn't one of them, I hope he makes it.
It's not gonna be enough, Dad.
Enough what? Hope.
[Sighs.]
[Walker growling.]
[Walker growling.]
[Silenced gunshot.]
[Growling continues.]
[Thuds softly.]
[Door rattling.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Door rattling.]
[Grunts.]
[Body thuds.]
[Shuddering breath.]
30 minutes.
Everyone's ready.
Are you? It's one person who brought it to this.
One person.
It always starts with one person.
This did.
What we're doing here now.
This -- This isn't about me.
Yes.
It isn't.
You made it like that.
[Engine revs.]
[Engine revving.]
[Engine shuts off.]
[Engine starts.]
Come here.
[Engine starts, revs.]
[Brakes squeal.]
This is the end of it.
[Engine revs.]
I know you wanted to go with him.
I did, too.
Everything hurts.
But I'll help you defend this place.
Help me? Oh, yeah.
This is your show.
[Scoffs.]
Okay You'll see.
[Walker growling.]
[Rick whistles.]
[Groans.]
[Body thuds.]
[Breathing heavily.]
What are you up to, Rick? [Coughs.]
You think you're gonna take us on? [Coughs, groans.]
I saw you beggin'.
Crying.
You're gonna beg again, Rick.
[Coughs.]
[Breathing heavily.]
Your -- Your boy's gonna die.
[Coughing.]
[Walker growling.]
Aah! [Flesh tearing.]
No, no, no! [Growling continues.]
[Indistinct conversations.]
[Brakes squeal.]
Andy: Sure are a lot of us here.
I got your back.
Really? You just met me.
We all just met each other.
[Indistinct conversations.]
Aaron: Are you praying? I always meant to start.
Better late than never.
Jerry: Here.
Over your sternum.
No, I'm going back with Maggie after.
Dude.
Sternum.
Duuuuuude.
Rick: You up to this? Maggie: I got the Hilltop to stand against the Saviors.
I need to be there.
At least for the first part.
They say you can wage war through the second trimester.
[Chuckles.]
I've been fighting since the farm.
Can't stop now.
How about tomorrow? You been thinking about what that looks like? Yes, I have.
I don't know if I can wait for it.
Just one more fight.
And I'm gonna be there.
At least for the first part.
Ezekiel: I'm told the Hilltop lost their doctor.
An obstetrician, no less.
We have a doctor in the Kingdom.
A woman of talent.
Join us.
We'll get ours back.
[Laughs.]
Yes, Jesus.
Yes, you will.
As sure as the day defeats the night.
And on this day, we begin to reshape this world for your child and the children to come.
So let's get started.
[Sighs.]
What? Hilltop's lucky to have you.
You showed me how to be someone worth following.
Good.
After this I'm following you.
Here we go.
10 9 8 76 5 4 3 2 Shit.
[Wind whistling.]
No.
There.
Tara: Okay.
Close enough.
All right, let's go.
Got it? Yeah.
[Engine starts, revs.]
[Walkers growling.]
Woman: It went up towards the herdway.
Dwight: Go big.
2 cars, 10 guns.
We're not messing around, not now.
You take the Sister route.
It's locked down.
Do you think it was them? Nah.
Probably something left over, maybe under one of the bodies.
I want some bang bang, Dwighty.
I want some scream scream.
I want blood.
Well maybe you'll get lucky.
Carol: How close are we? Daryl: Close.
[Walkers growling in distance.]
[Silenced gunshots.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Brakes squeal.]
[Engines shut off.]
[Vehicle doors open.]
[Growling continues.]
[Guns cock.]
[Gunshots.]
[Doorknob creaks.]
Well, shit.
I'm sorry.
I was in a meeting.
[Insects chirping.]
[Creaking softly.]
["Weird Al" Yankovic's "Another One Rides the Bus" plays in distance.]
Another one rides the bus Another one rides the bus And another comes on and another comes on Another one rides the bus Hey, who's gonna sit by you? Another one rides the bus Mnh.
Another one rides the bus, hey, hey! Another one rides the bus Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyyyy You turned off the alarm.
They can manage without you for one morning.
Carl: We're all playing hooky.
All of us? The window doesn't open, and the fan is broke Hey, I didn't put that song on.
Mm.
[Chuckles.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
Negan: Well, shit.
I'm sorry.
I was in a meeting.
[Growling continues.]
I see you got your little mudflaps with you.
So I'm not exactly feelin' a reason for us to try throwin' lead at each other.
I care about my people.
I don't want to just march them into the line of fire because I want play "my dick is bigger than yours.
" It is.
We both know it.
But I'm also comfortable enough to accept the fact if it wasn't.
I'm certainly not gonna let my people die over that shit like you're about to.
So, Rick, what the hell can I do for you? Dwight.
Your name's Simon.
You're Gavin.
And you Regina.
Rick, I'd feel remiss if -- Rick: No.
I know who you are.
Listen, you five.
The Saviors inside.
All of you have a chance to survive here.
To survive this.
You all can live if you surrender.
Can't guarantee it any time but now.
Right now.
[Walkers growling in distance.]
Tara: Shit.
Could that thing set it off? Morgan: I got it.
[Walkers growling.]
Negan: So they surrender and you and your little piss patrol doesn't kill them.
That sounds like a good deal! What about me, Rick? I told you.
Twice.
You know what's going to happen.
I do.
I do know what's gonna happen.
You don't.
You have no idea the shit that's about to go down.
Let me ask you something, Rick -- Do you think you have the numbers for this fight? You don't.
Simon? Of course that's where he went.
Negan: What do you have to say to the Rick and the piss patrol, Gregory? The Hilltop stands with Negan and the Saviors.
Any resident of the Hilltop who takes up arms or who supports this ultimatum against the Sanctuary or any of the Saviors, for that matter -- they will no longer be welcome in the colony.
And? Their families will be thrown out and will be left to fend for themselves.
And? Go home now.
Or you won't have a home to go back to.
You do what you need to do.
All I have at the Hilltop are a bunch of books and an old lobster bib.
Negan: You heard the man.
Go back to separating wheat and shit or whatever the hell it is you people do.
Doesn't look like anyone's goin', does it? Hilltop stands with -- The Hilltop stands with Maggie! [Walker growling.]
I feel like I invested a lot in you, and I am very, very disappointed.
[Grunting.]
[Body thudding.]
[Engine revs.]
[Wire rattles.]
[Explosions in distance.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
Sounds like shit is goin' down, Rick.
You "lieutenants" you're gonna have to make up your minds.
Maybe we can take a time-out here -- No.
This has to happen now.
This is the only way.
[Growling continues.]
You're gonna make me count.
[Chuckles.]
Okay.
Okay.
I'm counting.
10! 9! 8! 7! [Gun cocks.]
[Gunshots.]
[Gunfire.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
Carol: It's started.
Daryl: Yeah.
It was always gonna be that way.
[Walkers growling.]
Tara: Pleasure doing business with you.
Beat 'em.
We will.
Be careful.
[Engine starts.]
Shit, this is gonna be fun.
[Growling continues.]
No, it isn't.
It's better than lettin' things be, though, right? Yeah.
It is.
[Growling continues.]
Now! [Gunfire.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Gunfire.]
[Horn honks.]
[Engine revs.]
[Gunshot, explosion.]
[Gunfire continues.]
[Gunshot, explosion.]
[Engine revs.]
[Gunshot, explosion.]
[Gunfire.]
[Gunshot.]
Go! [Gunfire.]
[Gunshot, explosion.]
[Gunfire continues.]
[Growling.]
[Gunshot, explosion.]
[Gunshot, explosion.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Gunfire.]
[Explosion.]
[Walkers growling, gunfire.]
[Groans.]
Gabriel: Rick! [Distorted gunfire.]
He's not going anywhere! Rick! Rick! We have to go! Rick! Rick! He's not going anywhere! We have to leave now! It's not about you, right? Not about you.
Come here.
[Gunfire continues.]
[Camera shutter clicks, whirs.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Engine starts.]
[Tires screech.]
No, no.
Wait.
Wait.
Whoa! [Groans.]
Shit.
[Gun cocks.]
[Gunfire.]
I'm gonna get you out of here.
We just have to wait for our moment.
Thank you, Father.
Thank God.
Sure, whatever.
[Gunfire.]
The -- The -- The shots -- they're too close! Why are they firing at me? [Gunshots.]
Wait.
[Gunfire continues.]
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait! Wait! [Groans.]
[Engine starts.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Gunfire continues.]
[Car door closes.]
We can wait some more.
We can't.
He stopped to get me.
How's that? Negan.
[Sighs.]
He was on the ground.
I was trying to kill him, and Gabriel stopped to get me.
We gotta start out.
You all right? [Chuckles.]
This isn't about me.
Let's go.
Yeah.
[Whistles.]
[Engine starts.]
We were gonna start with taking out the guards with arrows.
You think you can still hit them through that? I wouldn't bet on it.
[Arrow fires.]
[Grunts.]
[Gates creaking.]
[Gunfire.]
[Metal scrapes, clattering.]
Down! [Explosion.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Growling continues.]
[Growling continues.]
[Breathing heavily.]
Negan: I hope you got your shitting pants on.
What? Your shittin' pants.
I hope you're wearing them right now 'cause you are about to shit your pants.
[Growling continues.]
Daddy! [Chuckling.]
Hey! [Smooches.]
They made a big owl for the party! What? People are taking this festival extremely seriously.
A big owl? Another one rides the bus It's outside.
[Gasps.]
They're gonna get you.
Never.
Should we go see? Hey, who's gonna sit by you? I'm not afraid of a big owl.
How big is it? [Indistinct conversation.]
Let's go! [Mid-tempo music plays.]
[Chuckles.]
[Birds chirping.]
My mercy prevails over my wrath.
[Chuckles.]
I don't want to wait for it anymore.
You don't either -- Yeah, I know.
So we don't have to wait for it.
If we start tomorrow right now with everything we've beaten, everything we've endured, everything we've risen above, everything we've become If we start tomorrow right now no matter what comes next we've won.
We've already won.
[Crowd cheers.]
