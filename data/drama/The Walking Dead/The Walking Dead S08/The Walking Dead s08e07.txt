1 Previously on AMC's "The Walking Dead" I need to see the Sanctuary.
We both do.
We got a lot more work to do.
Simon: One of our own did this - is doing this, right now.
[Door creaks.]
You need to see Dr.
Carson 2.
0 A.
S.
A.
P.
I do.
Your choice is to forget Negan, switch sides again.
No.
[Rick breathing heavily.]
[Footsteps approach.]
[Lock clicks.]
[Door opens.]
Rick: It's not too late for you.
My offer still stands.
You can join us or you can die.
[Flash bulb pops.]
[Bulb clatters.]
Turn.
[Flash bulb pops.]
[Bulb clatters.]
[Flash bulb pops.]
[Bulb clatters.]
[Doors creaking.]
Why? Why the pictures? Sculpt you, after.
- After what? - After.
[Walkers growling in distance.]
[Knock on door.]
[Door opens.]
[Door creaks.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
I'm well-aware you're the fifth columner.
Green duffel, red paint, workers' guns.
Doesn't require Turing-grade decryption to grok the truth that you're the traitor creeping and colluding with AHK.
It's an acronym I've concocted Alexandria, Hilltop, Kingdom.
I considered going with KAH, but it remains a hair too onomatopoeic.
I've been charged by no less than Negan himself with cracking the very calamity you more than likely had a heavy hand in creating.
So I need you to cease and desist all betrayals and backstabbery, fronting and Judas-ness A.
S.
A.
P.
In exchange, I offer to keep what I know from Negan and the others.
[Gasps.]
The Saviors are finished.
Negan's finished.
And this place what it's been that's all over.
Food and water's runnin' low, workers are angry, the Saviors, they're gettin' scared.
And this place is gonna fall, and all you have to do to be on the winning side is to stand down.
All you have to do is nothing.
Wait.
Let it play out.
Can you do that? You've seen what happens here heard the screams smelled the burning skin.
You don't got blood on your hands yet, but that's comin'.
Once you do those things, you become those things, and there's no goin' back.
No forgettin' it.
What cranks my shaft is bein' safe.
And here me bein' safe means a whole lot of other people are safe.
I think about that a great deal.
[Chair creaks.]
Yes, I'm Negan and it ain't perfect, but we are Saviors.
We save.
Like I said your cloak-and-dagger's on the Q.
T.
All I ask is that you do nothin' that results in harm to anyone inside these walls, and it'll stay that way.
[Door creaks.]
[Muffled walkers growling.]
What do you think? [Growling continues.]
A day.
Maybe two.
[Growling continues.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
Dr.
Carson: Eugene.
I could use a little help.
Can you come in? He's getting worse.
It's an infection.
Maybe more than one.
It's attacking his organs.
It's only a matter of time until one fails.
- Just wish we had some damn meds.
- Mm.
I wish he hadn't assisted in the ill-conceived caper to trap us in here.
I also wish for Razzles, but if wishes were horses and all that - What, you think this is his fault? - It is.
Not the whole of it, but he was a member of the campaign.
I do get it but I shan't forget it.
- Would you sit with him? - How's that? I'm gonna head to the marketplace, see if they have any herbs down there, try some Eastern medicine on him.
He shouldn't be alone.
And he's your friend.
Eugene: Traveling companion.
Okay.
Do you want him to die? No.
I'll be back soon.
[Door closes.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
[Coughing.]
[Groans.]
Sit.
You look worse than me.
Mm.
I don't appreciate that, because you look like a potato and shit casserole.
Sit.
[Coughing.]
Are you gonna help me get Dr.
Carson out of here? Given that this building is currently surrounded by a Wilkes-Barre of walkers, I don't see an escape attempt without putting to use the same flawed technique of innards which landed you in your status-quo piss-poor condition.
What you may have forgotten in your request is that I am a small person who does not stick his neck out for anyone other than himself.
I stick firmly within my lane without any need for a signal, hand or automatic.
All I want is for you to do the right thing.
And what is said definition on that? Can't say I ever sussed it out.
Right for some can be downright horrific for others, and knowing that has kept me vertical when so many have gone horizontal.
It requires faith, trusting yourself.
Believing that God is inside of you guiding you and knowing that he has a plan for all of us.
Is that so hard? It's absurd.
Is it? You're a man of science who not too long ago would've found it impossible to believe that the dead could walk.
So maybe maybe it's not impossible to believe that you will know what the right thing is when the time comes.
And then you will you'll act.
Man: Got something.
Looked like a truck, but I lost visual from the water tower.
[Bird squawking.]
[Wood clatters.]
It's one of ours.
[Knock on door.]
[Door creaks.]
Tanya, hello.
You said a week.
It's been a week.
Our deal? My boombox? - Well, yes, I mean - Did you fix it? A-Are you serious? Yeah.
Well, it's not ready.
Our neck is in the noose of the deceased, and it is tightening with every ticktock.
Are you not distressed that we're trapped? I was already trapped here.
You've got until tomorrow, Eugene, and then we renegotiate.
Wait.
[Door creaks.]
Would it be possible to take possession of the second bottle despite the delivery delinquency? The deal was one bottle up front and one bottle after you fix it.
I need it.
You making it into jet fuel or something? I've taken to throwing 1.
5 fluid ounces down my gullet most P.
M.
s as a necessary requirement to catching some increasingly elusive Z's.
Ergo, I need the giggle juice.
[Door creaks.]
I get it.
I need help sleeping, too.
I don't get it.
Yes, you do.
You help them, Eugene.
You help him.
I tried to stop this.
Me and Frankie, we came to you, and we asked you for your help.
You could've changed this place into something else, something better.
But you took care of you, and now you've got to live with that.
I hope this helps.
But it won't.
[Door opens.]
Negan wants you.
Tara: Our people are gonna be at the Sanctuary soon, asking for their surrender.
We're almost there.
That's why we do it.
We make it happen.
So we cover you with crossfire from the upper windows, you crash the truck into the walkers and through to the building.
Yep, crack it open, Savior buffet.
Rosita: You know the workers will make it away, up the stairs? They're on the other side of the building.
They should make it.
You sure? After we do this, their only choice is to give up.
It's risky.
They could see the truck comin'.
There weren't any more weapons at the Saviors' warehouse, right? No more rockets for the RPG's.
- We work with what we got.
- You got me.
Other snipers, too.
Saviors see you comin', we got you covered, whatever it takes.
I want it done.
I want them done.
Daryl: Good.
So, we doin' this or what? W-Why don't we just wait it out like we planned? [Scoffs.]
Michonne's right.
What you're talking about is risky.
Things could go bad.
Tara: The truck with the speakers almost took all those walkers away.
It almost did go bad.
Something else could.
Daryl: Even if it don't, we don't got the Kingdom fighters no more.
I mean, if the Saviors want to put up a fight, we don't got the numbers to make 'em surrender.
That's why Rick's talking to the Scavengers.
Tara: You got shot.
They lied to us.
- You You believe 'em now? - I believe in Rick Grimes.
I could've done something sooner, to end this.
I knew about those weapons at Oceanside, and I waited.
I didn't do shit about it.
With or without you, I'm not letting that happen again.
Then it's without me.
I'm out.
We got some cars parked near the east-side lookout.
You can take one and go home.
[Insects chirping.]
You staying? You good with all this? I helped get this started.
Got to see it through.
You think it's easier to come out here and risk than to stay back there and wait.
And I get it I used to believe that, too.
Thing is sometimes, you just have to wait.
Sometimes you don't get to know.
I just wish it didn't take seeing Sasha walk out of that coffin to realize it.
Daryl: Come on.
Let's go.
[Truck door opens.]
If things don't get fixed soon, a lot of people are gonna die.
My people.
Not me, of course.
I'm livin' no matter what.
I am too good at this shit.
But others I can't have that.
I don't want to see people get shot up, chewed up, and chewing up the rest.
I don't want to see you get eaten, Eugene.
This place, it's about pooling and organizing strength.
And you my friend, are strong.
That spongy organ between your eyes and your spectacular mullet is strong, and I just want to make sure that you know that I know that.
Consider me made.
Our pages are utterly and completely one and the same.
Eugene I was going for a handshake.
Stand up.
Now, I can see where you'd be confused, as I rarely do that shit.
A handshake is a sign of mutual respect.
Not many people get that from me.
There's work that needs getting to.
[Head lamp clicks.]
[Sasha growling.]
[Breathes shakily.]
[Exhales deeply.]
[Lid creaks.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
[Lid creaks.]
- [Walkie-talkie clicks.]
- Hey, cut that engine.
Any closer, you'll draw walkers from the yard.
[Brakes squeal, engine shuts off.]
Here.
You take fire from the windows, we fire back.
Come on.
There's a spot for cover by the chutes.
You up for this? I came here 'cause I wanted to see things for myself.
I wanted to know that things were gonna work.
But you know what? I don't get to know that.
None of us do.
What I do know is that things are working now.
So maybe we just need to trust that things are gonna keep working, because this what we're about to do it's not worth risking us.
It is for me.
Just is.
I hope it works.
I-I really, really do, but I-I can't do it.
I just can't.
Then you shouldn't.
[Truck door closes.]
We got Morgan and the snipers.
We can do this.
Yeah.
We will.
[Walkers growling.]
Eugene: Audio recording for transcription.
Emergency operations manual, first entry.
Countermeasure approach for fence incursion.
High pop of undead, good 40, 50 deep to the former fence.
Note to accompany schematics for audio glider emergency binder.
Audio glider activated for sound, utilizing music as 96 decibel redirection, drawing active deceased along with it away from all exits, allowing immediate free passage for permanent redirection, if successful.
Scratch the if when When successful.
Hell, yes.
Dwight: Don't turn around.
[Walkers growling in distance.]
[Walkie-talkie clicks.]
I'm here.
I'm ready.
[Walkie-talkie clicks.]
South lookout ready for go.
Man: East lookout, ready.
Man #2: North lookout, ready.
Man #3: West lookout, ready.
[Brakes squeal.]
Dwight: Get up, back away from that thing.
Back away from it! I'm attempting to save people, Dwight.
And killin' me is killin' a great many innocents.
When this bird slips its surly bounds, it's gonna Pied Piper away their cold corpses and free this place.
And Negan will kill Rick and Daryl and Rosita and all your old friends.
They're former traveling companions, nothing more.
I'm working with them to keep them and the people here alive.
We can get rid of Negan.
Just Negan.
And we're almost there.
Negan ain't the dyin' type, Dwight.
- Oh, but you are, Eugene.
- [Voice breaking.]
I am.
That's exactly why I've not yet stepped back, as it were.
By my reckoning, I have two selects on facin' my fate.
One, I abort launch on this glider, don't free this place from the stranglehold of cold teeth/tongues, and Negan will likely execute me as what he considers to be a personal favor.
Or I could go for what's behind door number two, take my chances being shot in the back by a sometime-ally, despite any injury I may have caused in the past by delivering a chomp down on your chode.
[Upbeat music plays loudly.]
[Motor whirring.]
[Walkers growling.]
Now! [Engine revving.]
[Music continues.]
[Gunshots.]
[Music stops.]
[Walkers growling.]
[Machine-gun fire.]
[Gunshots.]
[Machine-gun fire.]
[Growling continues.]
[Gunshots.]
[Machine-gun fire.]
[Growling continues.]
Daryl, you're clear to the south.
You and Tara should head home.
[Walkers growling.]
[Gunfire.]
[Indistinct shouting.]
[Walkers growling.]
[People screaming.]
Let's go! Move it! Let go! [Gunfire.]
Fall back! Move! Move! Fall back! Move! Move! [Screaming continues.]
[Gunfire.]
[Growling continues.]
[Gunfire.]
[Man screaming.]
[Gunfire continues.]
Move! Move! [Growling continues.]
[Door creaks.]
The answer is no! I will never, not on your Nelly, be on board with your plan.
Your invite is declined.
I will not end up like Sasha or you.
You both made your choices, what I imagine most will calculate as the right thing, rolled your D20s and came up dead and seemingly soon to be.
I cannot do the same.
Now, judge me if you choose, but I'm seeing 20 for 20, I'm feeling 10 for 10, I'm receiving 5 by 5 that staying safe means staying alive, and I'm A-okay with doing whatever it takes to lock that down.
So I will obey Negan.
I will not cover for anyone's U-turn on loyalties, and I will damn well make sure that Dr.
Carson stays cozy, comfy right here in case I ever require his healing expertise! And I won't feel bad about it.
Because I will survive.
It's in my biological imperative.
It's all I know how to do.
[Door slams.]
Negan: It'll take an ass-load of ammo.
It will.
Even with shot discipline and P and Q minding.
Can my bullet maker fill my guns back up? If you give my machines to me or me to my machines that is an affirmative.
You do realize the storm of shit I'm gonna dump on Rick as soon as I am clear of the shit storm he dumped on me.
I do, indeed.
Goddamn, Eugene.
How does it feel to be the second-most important person here? How does it feel to save these good people? It feels great.
Got something else of urgency for you.
Nother item solved.
More than a way out and a promise of bullets on the way? Jesus, Eugene, you are magnificent.
I am.
So, what is it? Tell me.
[Knock on door.]
- What? - [Door opens.]
We have the stairs.
But the dead ones have the lower level The whole thing.
Not much longer.
See, Eugene has solved us a way out of this mess.
And he actually says he has a topper.
Yeah? I think I could fix the intercom system.
Which, uh would absolutely change the face of communications here.
That's it? Sorry.
That kind of thing, uh well, cranks my shaft.
I'll leave you to the last action item.
[Machine-gun fire in distance.]
[Machine-gun fire continues.]
[Retches.]
[Walker growling.]
Time for after.
[Growling continues.]
[Grunts.]
[Grunts.]
Jadis: Subdue! [Grunts.]
[Gunshots.]
[Both grunting.]
I'm walking out now, and me walking out means all of you die.
My people There's a lot of them Won't attack today, but we will attack.
[Walker growling.]
You can play your games, draw your pictures, sculpt whatever shit you want, but I am leaving! After that maybe you should just run.
We done? Yes.
Join you.
What then? The Sanctuary is surrounded.
Walkers.
20 deep around the compound.
You'll come with me there we'll wait till the others meet us.
When they do, we'll ask the lieutenants to surrender.
All of us, together.
Then I kill Negan, me alone.
We have a deal? After, Saviors' things our things.
Yes and yes.
It'll be all of ours.
You'll get a fourth.
- Half.
- A fourth.
Fourth, and I sculpt you after.
Stand for me, those off.
These off, no sculpting.
My boots and my clothes now.
Fourth.
Fourth.
[Brakes squeal.]
[Walkers growling in distance.]
[Growling intensifies.]
- [Walkie-talkie clicks.]
- Snipers, report in.
[Static.]
This is Rick Grimes.
Does anybody copy? [Walkie-talkie clicks.]
