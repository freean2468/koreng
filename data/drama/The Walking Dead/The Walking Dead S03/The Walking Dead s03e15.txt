Previously on AMC's The Walking Dead Merle has military experience.
He may be erratic, but don't underestimate his loyalty to his brother.
I want Michonne.
He'll kill her.
Are you willing to sacrifice your daughters' lives for her? Position gunmen all around that feed store.
The minute you see Michonne, you open fire.
Kill the others, but you keep her alive.
I have to go back, warn them.
Shh, shh.
It's the only way.
No one else knows.
You gonna tell 'em? Not till after.
We have to do it today.
It has to be quiet.
You got a plan? We tell her we need to talk.
Away from the others.
Just ain't us, man.
No.
No, it isn't.
We do this, we avoid a fight.
No one else dies.
Okay.
We need someone else.
I'll talk to him.
I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.
- No.
Just me.
Just looking for a little vacation.
Best dope I ever had was in a mattress.
Nothing.
This place must have been no fun at all.
We need your help.
Do you even know why you do the things you do? The choices you make? If we give the Governor Michonne, Woodbury stands down.
I don't like it, but it's what needs to be done.
We need to make it quiet.
We need your help with that.
You ain't told any of the others, huh? Just Hershel, Daryl and you.
Huh.
The inner circle.
I'm honored.
You know, when we'd go out on runs, he'd bash somebody's skull, slash somebody's throat, and he'd say, "Never waste a bullet.
" I always thought it was just an excuse.
You go on.
Give him that girl.
He ain't gonna kill her, you know.
He's just gonna do things to her.
Probably take out one of her eyes.
Both of 'em, most likely.
You'd let that happen for a shot? Whew.
You're cold as ice, Officer Friendly.
You're gonna need wire, not rope.
Wire.
Nothing she could chew through.
Oh.
You know something? You're right.
I don't know why I do the things I do.
Never did.
I'm a damn mystery to me.
But I know you, Rick.
Yeah, I thought a lot about you.
You ain't got the spine for it.
We need to get her to the Governor by noon.
Hey! Come on! Over here! - Hey! Come on! - Over here! Hey! Right here! Over here! - Come on! - Here! Here! Come on! Come on, let's go.
They try to drive up to the gate again, maybe some blown tires will stop them.
- That's a good idea.
- It was Michonne's.
We don't have to win.
We just have to make their getting at us more trouble than it's worth.
Hey.
Let's go.
Ain't no way.
What? Nothing.
What happened here? We got any whiskey? Hell, I'd even drink vodka.
Go to hell, Merle.
Are you with us? Sure.
I'm not talking about occupying the same space.
Are you with us? I'm here for my brother.
Well, he's here for us.
It's not time to do shots.
It's time to pick a damn side.
You ain't like you was back in the camp-- a little mouse running around, scared of her own shadow.
It wasn't my shadow, it was my husband's.
Well, you don't seem scared of nothing anymore.
I'm not.
Hmm.
You're a late bloomer.
Maybe you are, too.
Hey.
You seen Merle around? He say he was sorry yet? 'Cause he is.
He's gonna make it right.
I'm gonna make him.
There's got to be a way.
Just needs to be a little forgiveness is all.
He tied me to a chair, beat me, and threw a walker in the room.
Maybe I could call it even.
But he-- he took Maggie to a man who terrorized her, humiliated her.
I care more about her than I care about me.
Merle.
You down here? Merle.
Hey, little brother.
What the hell? I was just about to holler back at ya.
What you doing down here? Just looking for a little crystal meth.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Shit mess my life up when everything is going so sweet, right? You talk to Rick yet? Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I'm in.
But, uh, he ain't got the stomach for it.
He's gonna buckle.
You know that, right? Yeah.
If he does, he does.
You want him to? Whatever he says goes.
Man.
Do you even possess a pair of balls, little brother? Are they even attached? I mean, if they are, they belong to you? You used to call people like that sheep.
What happened to you? What happened with you and Glenn and Maggie? I've done worse.
You need to grow up.
Things are different now.
Your people look at me like I'm the devil grabbing up those lovebirds like that, huh? Now y'all want to do the same damn thing I did-- snatch someone up and deliver them to the Governor, just like me.
Yeah.
People do what they got to do or they die.
Can't do things without people anymore, man.
Maybe these people need somebody like me around, huh? Do their dirty work.
The bad guy.
Yeah, maybe that's how it is now, huh? How does that hit you? I just want my brother back.
Get out of here, man.
"Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night.
Nor for the arrow that flieth by day.
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness.
Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
1,000 shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand.
But it shall not come nigh thee.
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence.
" You're not there.
She's not there.
"He shall cover thee and under His wings shalt thou trust.
There shall no evil befall thee.
Neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
" You okay? What I wouldn't do to keep you two safe.
Rick? What you're about to do-- I can't.
I won't.
- So where is it? - Around the corner.
We got to clear some walkers, then get the others down here to barricade it.
A breach like this could be an open invitation to the Governor.
He's not much for subtlety.
You want to take your chances? Governor made Rick an offer.
Turn you over and we all give peace a chance.
I agree with you.
He would have blinked.
But not you.
I'm being straight with you.
You were straight when you led me into the tombs.
Okay, maybe I wasn't straight.
You put a bag over my head.
I got it done.
He wouldn't.
Keep moving.
He was a guy that came back for me on that rooftop.
Nah.
It's all on me.
You know? I figure that's why I was back there in the first place.
Do the dirty work.
May I? I'll take that as a yes.
Oh! You know what? I'd figured you would have run.
Wanted my sword back before I get away.
It may go down that way.
But if I were you, I wouldn't get my hopes up.
Move.
It's off.
We'll take our chances.
I'm not saying it was the wrong call, but this is definitely the right one.
What's wrong? I can't find Merle or Michonne.
They've gone.
Come on.
He was in here.
Said he was looking for drugs.
Said a lot of things, actually.
Like what? Said that you were gonna change your mind.
Here we go.
Yeah, he took her here.
They mixed it up.
Damn it! I'm going after him.
- You can't track for shit.
- Then the both of us.
No, just me.
I said I'd go and I'll go.
Plus they're gonna come back here.
You need to be ready.
Your family, too.
I want to be with my brother.
My brother, he wants to be in the prison.
This little trip maybe it'll keep that place standing.
If I pull it off, maybe all is forgiven.
That's a whole lot of maybes.
You got to play the hand you're dealt.
I only got one.
You talk about the weight of what you have to do, how you can handle it.
A bad man, someone truly evil, they're light as a feather.
They don't feel a thing.
I've killed 16 men since all this went down.
Let's go.
Look at what that bastard's done.
Look at us.
He's one man.
There'll be others like him.
There always have been.
I know.
It's like the walkers.
There's nothing we can do.
When you gave me this I didn't fully understand what it meant.
Such a simple thing.
I know what it means now.
I know what it takes.
I want to marry Maggie.
And we don't have to have a wedding.
I don't even know if we'll last the week.
But I want her to know before who knows? You have my blessing.
Thank you.
All right.
I think we're good.
Yeah, we're great.
Come on.
Yeah! That's the deal.
Oh, shit.
Merle! Come on, Merle! Merle! Okay.
Okay.
Ah! Come on.
Let's go! So is this your thing, then? You take out the trash? Don't be so hard on yourself, darlin'.
The Governor, Rick, anyone who needs their piss bucket emptied and you come a-running.
Things are different for your brother.
Yeah, they are.
Rick says jump and he wants to know how high.
Mm-mmm.
Rick needs him.
Respects him.
He didn't ask him to do this little job, now, did he? No, 'cause he wants it done.
You keep telling yourself that.
The truth is this could have been your shot.
With your skills, a whole new beginning.
But you choose to stay on the outside.
No one's gonna mourn you, not even Daryl.
He's got a new family.
You keep trying to get under my skin, I'm gonna cut that tongue out.
Your buddy's turning you over 'cause he's trying to save his own ass.
You're as much on the outside as I am, girl.
Maybe.
But once the Governor's done with me, at least I won't have to live with myself.
You said you killed 16 men since this thing started? You ever kill anyone before? No.
And how about before Woodbury? Before you met him? Huh.
So he saves your life, cleans you up, fed you a line of bullshit.
Why would you kill somebody else for him? You know, we can go back.
Ain't happening.
Both of us.
We can just go back.
I can't go back.
Don't you understand that? I can't.
Why? You go back with them.
Get ready for what's next.
I got something I got to do on my own.
Hey! Where's my brother? You kill him? He let me go.
Don't let anyone come after me.
Where's it coming from? Come on, come on.
With me.
We'll have to spread out! You two with me.
Walkers! All over! Hey, over there.
You leave him to me! I ain't gonna beg.
I ain't begging you.
No.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Carl was looking for you.
He found me.
I think we should head over.
Rick has something to say.
Uh, just one more thing before that.
Here.
Yes.
When I met with the Governor, he offered me a deal.
He said-- he said he would leave us alone if I gave him Michonne.
And I was gonna do that to keep us safe.
I changed my mind.
But now Merle took Michonne to fulfill the deal and Daryl went to stop him and I don't know if it's too late.
I was wrong not to tell you.
And I'm sorry.
What I said last year, that first night after the farm it can't be like that.
It can't.
What we do, what we're willing to do, who we are, it's not my call.
It can't be.
I couldn't sacrifice one of us for the greater good because we are the greater good.
We're the reason we're still here, not me.
This is life and death.
How you live how you die-- it isn't up to me.
I'm not your Governor.
We choose to go.
We choose to stay.
We stick together.
We vote.
We can stay and we can fight or we can go.
No!
