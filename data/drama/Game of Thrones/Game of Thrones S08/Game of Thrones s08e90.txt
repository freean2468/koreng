Okay.  So it's our biggest season ever,  there's a lot of decisions that need to be made.  It's something simple like a wolf  running with a guy, for us it means  a 150-foot green screen  with a tracking vehicle in Calgary.  You know, it's fun. It's a fun puzzle to figure out,  you know, and when you do figure it out it's  I think that's why I used to love algebra,  is that you'd figure out the equation,  when you got that answer it was like, "Wow."  And so it's the same with this. We keep messing with the puzzle,  and then when that last piece fits,  you're like, "Yeah, it worked."  [CHUCKLES.]  STAFFER: For you.  My schedule ends up being It's, you know, very  and that's a simple one.  Like the Art Department, they go horizontally,  but I decided I want to go I go vertically.  FINLAY: Do you thrive on all of this, Chris?  [CHUCKLING.] Not particularly. What?  It's all I've done since I left school,  I don't know anything else.  [.]  NEWMAN: The way Game of Thrones is developed  is every episode has as much in it  as any one feature film,  but we have to do it quicker and for less money.  All you can do with any large operation is  get the best people around you and let them go.  As we said, we're trying to figure out how  [CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY.]  [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE.]  BLAIR: This is our first day of fittings,  and we're just doing 25, I think it is, today.  We have the same people, like, every year.  It's really nice, they're like a little family.  They always kind of show up every year.  [HUMS.]  - Keep you nice and warm. - Mm.  BLAIR:       And he's obsessed with the whole show.  It would be really cool if youse got to meet him,  he'd be so excited.  McCLAY: Hey, what?  Thanks, Brad.  Yeah, man.  - FINLAY: Are you Andrew? - I am.  FINLAY: You're the person I'm here to see.

Paper and water,  and it does the job.  [MACHINERY BEEPING.]  You probably need to go into that, uh, hay doober, Steve.  It's just trying to work out where we need to put stuff  and where we don't, you know?  You can go on and reckon we're just seeing that,  but, you know, you move the camera just an inch  and it's another 10 meters that you have to dress.  You can't just throw money at things, you know?  I'm a stickler for that.  I don't like to give away too much money.  I don't like to waste anything. I know it's not mine,  but don't waste it, you know?  FINLAY: What are you gonna do if it snows?  If it snows?

You cannot sit there  having a fag, otherwise the whole thing's gonna go up.      LISTON: That's an electric fence, so they'll not be tempted  to dander up past the electric fence.  MAN:   - Yeah. - [WOMAN LAUGHS.]  MAN [ON WALKIE.]: We've got caltrops in place where they're gonna be,  so we can, um, hide them for the switch.  [CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY.]  We just then They  [IMITATING WHOOSHING.]  [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY.]  I need to go a little bit higher.  I can see the legs and the heads.  But actually want to see them how they jump.  - Just adjust. - And then watch it,  - you can see the - IRLAM: I've said to the guys  the thing that they should focus on is planning  where they're going and making sure they all miss each other.  Let's put caltrops in front of caltrops.  So you create much more of a barrier, yeah?  DIRECTOR: Three, two, one, action!  [ALL SNARLING.]  DIRECTOR: Cut.

Thank you.  NUTTER: I've been brought in this season  to introduce Episodes 1, 2, and 4  to the throng out there that have been waiting  to see the final season of Game of Thrones.  I'm getting into the consequences  of what happens to people in their lives,  the war that's coming,  and of course how that affects people.  NUTTER:         Okay.  STRAPAZON: Thanks, we'll be in touch. Thanks.  STRAPAZON: He breaks down his scripts, which I help him do.  He gets floor plans printed out that he cuts up  and then blocks out where the characters are gonna go,  where they move to, where the camera's gonna go.  And it's a little road map for the whole scene.  He draws it all by hand,  and he likes it on U.S. letter-size paper,  which is like 8 1/2 by 11, I think.  - FINLAY: Not A4? - No, he doesn't  A4, it doesn't work.  So we shipped over a big box of goldenrod paper.  FINLAY: Why does A4 not work?  [SIGHS.] Don't question the system.  This is my nemesis, this copy machine.  [FINLAY CHUCKLES.]  [SIGHS.]  It's upside down.  STRAPAZON: He is one of the few people  on the show that has printed scripts.  They were trying to go all digital this year,  have everything on iPads,  but that's just not how he rolls.  He claims he's a Luddite, but, you know, he's done  some of the most iconic episodes.  He did the Red Wedding and the Walk of Shame.  FINLAY: What is that a drawing of, on the top there?  NUTTER: That's a dead Theon, and that's Sansa overtop of him.  - FINLAY: On your special paper. - NUTTER: On my special paper.  FINLAY: How long have you used this process?  NUTTER: Since the very beginning.  - FINLAY: Did someone teach you? - I taught myself.  This is my method.  My methodology.  My stuff goes in that safe there,  nothing gets left out.  If you touch the paper at the wrong time  it will dissolve like Mission Impossible  and burn up.  [CHUCKLES.]  [.]  WOMAN: We're doing it tomorrow.  It needs to be up here.    ALEXANDER: It is, well,  just 20 past 4, yeah.  [LAUGHS.]  So yeah, those 4 or 5:00 starts are quite regular.  I think half past 3 has been the earliest,  when we were in Morocco.  [BOTH LAUGH.]  ALEXANDER: Cheers, all right.  - Good morning, darling. - CLARKE: Hi.  - BANKS: How are you? - CLARKE: All right.  ALEXANDER: Emilia's generally got dark hair,  so when you put the wig on, it looks like it's got roots.  CLARKE: This is the sexy bit.  So we have to put a little cap over  that kills any dark.  FINLAY: I don't think anyone knows it's this much work.  No. Also this is very lucky, to see this bit.  This is normally when someone like a producer  knocks on the door and you're like, "Not now!"  - Please, don't come in. - [ALL LAUGHING.]  [COUGHS.]  ALEXANDER: Gilly's gone glamorous.  BANKS: Ooh. She has. Looks very nice.  - ALEXANDER: A weekend look. - [ALL CHUCKLE.]  CLARKE:   BANKS:     No, it is, because that is still the most beautiful hair  I will ever have on my head, ever.  [LAUGHS.] It's magical.  When you put that on, it's just an instant whoa.  - BANKS: There she is. - CLARKE: Oh my God, there she is.  My heart is in my throat  when I think about this not happening much longer.  Putting this on.

Thank you.  CAULFIELD: Here we go.  - [WHOOPING.] - [CHUCKLES.]  SAMWELL: If it's not too much trouble,  I could use a pardon.  For what crime?  SAMWELL: I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.  STRAPAZON: I love me some Dragon Queen.  I love Daenerys. I love dragons.  I would hope that I would be a Targaryen,  minus the whole are they crazy, are they not crazy,  the incest thing and all that stuff.  But, um, being able to go from,  you know, waiting and watching it on my couch  to then being on the set when they're shooting  the final season, it's been kind of surreal.  FINLAY: Do we need to let you go do your job?  STRAPAZON: It would be good. I'm going to bring him almonds,  which will be very good. Protein, fuel him on set,  make sure he's got everything going.  I'm like his stamina elf.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  - STRAPAZON: Almonds? - NUTTER: Thank you.  STRAPAZON: Do you want any yang herbs?  - Oh, yes, yes. - Okay, yeah, I'll go get it.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: And roll sound, please.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  MAN: Thirty-nine Apple, take one.  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Quiet on the set.  NUTTER: First shot of the last season.  - And - [PEOPLE CHUCKLE.]  - CAMERA: Set. - SOUND: Set.  NUTTER: Action.  SAMWELL: Your Grace.  DAENERYS: Your brother stood with your father.  I offered to let him retain his lands and titles  if he bent the knee. He refused.  SAMWELL: Um, thank you, Your Grace, for telling me.  May I?  DAENERYS: Of course.  MAN [ON PA.]: Cut there.  [BELL RINGS.]  McCRUM: Basically it's called the heart attack van.  We just follow them 'round everywhere.  We tried to do healthy stuff,  but they like things that'll keep them going.  The tiger toast thing started just one day  whenever I was feeling a bit peckish myself  when I was in Tesco's doing my shopping.  I thought I'll go buy a tiger loaf and have a wee toastie,  and I made it fully loaded like this for myself.  One of the guys happened to notice it  and went, "What are you making?"  "Making myself a wee toastie."  He says, "Can I have one?"  Next thing everybody was coming, "Can I have one?"  And now it's one of the most popular things here.  Bacon, chicken, cheese, ham, tomato, onion,  tobacco onions, on the big tiger bread.  - McCRUM: Hello. - How are you?  - McCRUM: What's the crack? - Not much.  - Good.
