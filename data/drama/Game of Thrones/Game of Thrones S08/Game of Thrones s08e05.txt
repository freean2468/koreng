                    			1 We have won the Great War.  Now we will win the last war.  TYRION LANNISTER: The objective here is to remove Cersei  without destroying King's Landing.  ARYA STARK: You heading to King's Landing?  THE HOUND: There's some unfinished business.  ARYA: Me too.  THE HOUND: I don't plan on coming back.  Neither do I.  I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.  Seems like I won't get the chance.  BRIENNE OF TARTH: (TEARFULLY) Stay with me.  Please.  Cersei's hateful  And so am I.  (SOBS)  I need to tell you something.  But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.  What if there's someone else? Someone better.  At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in,  and you fight for that person.  Even if you know it's a mistake?  He has the better claim to the throne.  CERSEI LANNISTER: Every time a Targaryen is born,  the gods flip a coin.  BARRISTAN SELMY: The Mad King gave his enemies the justice  he thought they deserved.  TYRION: Children are not their fathers.  - OLENNA TYRELL: Be a dragon. - JORAH MORMONT: You have a gentle heart.  AEMON TARGARYEN: A Targaryen alone in the world  is a terrible thing.  VISERYS TARGARYEN: You don't want to awake the dragon, do you?  (MUSIC INTENSIFIES)    [KNOCK ON DOOR.]  Come in.  [DOOR OPENS.]  And?  Nothing?  She won't eat.  [.]  We'll try again at supper.  I think they're watching me.  - Who? - Her soldiers.  Of course they are. That's their job.  What have I told you, Martha?  The greater the risk, the greater the reward.  Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]  VARYS: The Northern armies?  JON: Just crossed the Trident.  They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days.  How is she?  She hasn't seen anyone since we returned.  Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.  She shouldn't be alone.  You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.  Aren't you worried for her?  I'm worried for all of us.  They say every time a Targaryen is born,  the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.  We're not much for riddles where I'm from.  We both know what she's about to do.  [SIGHS.]  That's her decision to make. She is our queen.  Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.  What do you want?  All I've ever wanted.  The right ruler on the Iron Throne.  I still don't know how her coin has landed.  But I'm quite certain about yours.  I don't want it.  I never have.  [SIGHS.]  I have known more kings and queens than any man living.  I've heard what they say to crowds,  and seen what they do in the shadows.  I have furthered their designs, however horrible.  But what I tell you now is true:  You will rule wisely and well, while she--  She  is my queen.  [.]  [EXHALES SOFTLY.]  Your Grace?  There's something you need to know.  Someone has betrayed me.  Yes.  Jon Snow.  Varys.  He knows the truth about Jon.  He does.  Because you told him.  You learned from Sansa.  And she learned from Jon,  though I begged him not to tell her.  As I said  he betrayed me.  TYRION: I'm glad Sansa told me.  I am your Hand.  I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.  And Varys?  Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.  You spoke to him first.  Without coming to me.  Without asking my permission.  It was a mistake.  Why do you think Sansa told you?  What do you think she hoped to gain?  - She trusts me. - Yes, she trusts you.  She trusted you to spread secrets  that could destroy your own queen.  And you did not let her down.  [.]  If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me.  Our intentions were good.  We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us.  Varys as much as anyone.  But it doesn't matter now.  No.  It doesn't matter now.  [DOOR OPENS.]  [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING.]  [EXHALES HEAVILY.]  [.]  It was me.  I hope I deserve this.  Truly, I do.  I hope I'm wrong.  [INHALES AND EXHALES SHARPLY.]  Goodbye, old friend.  Lord Varys.  [INHALES SHARPLY.]  I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,  First of My Name,  Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons  sentence you to die.  [GROWLING.]  Dracarys.  [ROARS.]  [GROWLS.]  [.]  This was all she brought with her  when we crossed the Narrow Sea.  Her only possession.      happen if you told your sister?  I don't want it, and that's what I told him.  She betrayed your trust.  She killed Varys as much as I did.  This was a victory for her.  Now she knows what happens  when people hear the truth about you.  Far more people in Westeros love you than love me.  I don't have love here.  I only have fear.  I love you.  And you will always be my queen.  Is that all I am to you?  Your queen?  [JON EXHALES HEAVILY.]  [SOFTLY.] All right, then.  Let it be fear.  TYRION: The people who live there, they're not your enemies.  They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.  DAENERYS: In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters  and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.  TYRION: They're afraid.  Anyone who resists Cersei  will see his family butchered.  You can't expect them to be heroes.  - They're hostages. - They are.  In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?  What does it matter whose fault it is?  Thousands of children will die if the city burns.  Your sister knows how to use  her enemies' weaknesses against them.  That's what she thinks our mercy is:  weakness.  - I beg you, my queen-- - But she's wrong.  Mercy is our strength.  Our mercy towards future generations  who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.  Ready the Unsullied.  Tonight you sail for King's Landing  - to join the Northern armies. - Cersei's followers  will abandon her if they know the war is lost.  Give them that chance.  - [INHALES SHARPLY.] - If the city surrenders,  they will ring the bells and raise the gates.  Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.  DAENERYS: Wait for me outside the city.  You'll know when it's time.  DAENERYS: Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.  [.]  It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all.  The next time you fail me  will be the last time you fail me.  [DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES.]  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  GUARD 1: Let them pass.  [BABY CRYING.]  GUARD 2: Through the gate.  GUARD 3: Get going.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  DAVOS: The rearguard should be here by daybreak.  TYRION: She wants to attack now.  Daybreak at the earliest.  SOLDIER 1: Careful with that. SOLDIER 2: My lord.  TYRION: Davos.  I need to ask you a favor.  You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?  I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?  SOLDIER 1: He's always better when he's got some food in him.  SOLDIER 2: Problem is when he's got drink in him.  See what he did the other week?  SOLDIER 1: Aye. Fighting as well.  Commander nearly caught him.  Ay up. Where you going?  I'm Arya Stark.  I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.  Think about it.  She kills Cersei, the war's over.  There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.  [CHUCKLES.]  I need to go talk to my captain.  Go ahead, talk to him.  SOLDIER 1: Where's he going?      [CLEARS THROAT.]    We speak the common tongue.  Ah. Good.  I want to be alone with the prisoner.  Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.  UNSULLIED: We have orders to guard the prisoner.  Ordered by whom? The queen herself?  - No. - TYRION: Well, in that case,  as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order.  Probably by quite a lot.  How did they find you?  Did you consider taking it off?  Cersei once called me "the stupidest Lannister."  And you're going back to her, to die with her.  You've underestimated her before.  She's going to die.  Unless you can convince her  to change her course of action.  Difficult to do from here.  [EXHALES HEAVILY.]  When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?  Try.  If not for yourself, if not for her,  then for every one of the million people in that city,  innocent or otherwise.  To be honest, I never really cared much for them.  Innocent or otherwise.  You do care for one innocent.  I know you do.  And so does Cersei.  She has a reason now.  The child is the reason she'll never give an inch.  All the worst things she's ever done,  she's done for her children.  It's not impossible that she'll win.  She won't.  Her enemy's forces have been depleted,  as she said they would be.  Two of the three dragons are dead.  - She's evened the odds. - The city will fall tomorrow.  She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company--  I defended the city last time it was attacked.  I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.  Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.  Why?  Escape.  The two of you, together.  Remember where we met,  where they keep the dragon skulls,  beneath the Red Keep?  Take her down there.  Keep following the stairways down,  down as far as they'll go.  You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep.  A dinghy will be waiting for you.  Sail out of the bay.  If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos.  Start a new life.  Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life?  Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war--  There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer.  Do it.  If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.  Swear to me.  You have my word.  If it works,  give the order to ring all the bells  in King's Landing and open the gates.  That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.  I'll try.  I never thought I'd get to repay the favor.  Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.  Your queen will execute you for this.  If Daenerys can make it to the throne  without wading through a river of blood,  maybe she'll show mercy  to the person who made that possible.  Tens of thousands of innocent lives  one not particularly innocent dwarf  it seems like a fair trade.  If it weren't for you,  I never would've survived my childhood.  [.]  [SOFTLY.] You would have.  You were the only one  who didn't treat me like a monster.  You were all I had.  [CRYING.]  [SNIFFLES.]  [.]  [MEN GRUNT.]  SOLDIER 1: Eyes on the horizon!  SOLDIER 2: Load the scorpion!  [GRUNTING.]  SOLDIER 3: Archers, close up!  MAN: Come on!  SOLDIER 4: Up to the espringal!  SOLDIER 5: To the back of it!  SOLDIER 6: Archers, line up!  [PEOPLE CLAMORING.]  WOMAN: This way!
