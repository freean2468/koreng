Sorry.  SANSA: You'll have as many as we can spare.  Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well.  There's no sense in manning the castles anymore.  We make our stand here.  At once, Your Grace.  "Your Grace."  But you're not.

A few died in transit.  They cheated at dice.  Or maybe I cheated.  Someone cheated.  They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.  - Horses? - Two thousand.  And elephants?  HARRY: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.  That's disappointing.  I was told the Golden Company had elephants.  HARRY: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace,  but not well-suited to long sea voyages.  In any event, you are most welcome  here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.  We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.  EURON: Am I most welcome here?  You are a true friend of the crown  and an honored guest.  EURON: Good.  As a true friend and an honored guest  [GRUNTS.]  [WHISPERS.] I was hoping we could talk in private.  After the war. That was our agreement.  Wars sometimes last years.  You want a whore, buy one.  You want a queen  earn her.  How?  I've given her justice,  an army and the Iron Fleet,  yet she gives me no sign of affection.  My heart is nearly broken.  You're insolent.  - I've executed men for less. - They were lesser men.  [.]  [CHUCKLES.]  [DOOR OPENS.]  DIRAH: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.  CRAYA: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.  - DIRAH: Archie, was it? - And William.  - Tall handsome William? - Yeah, tall handsome William.  They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.  I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.  - Did you? - BRONN: Nearly killed it.  That's brave.  [MOANING SOFTLY.]  [BRONN SIGHS.]  - CRAYA: That boy Eddie - DIRAH: The ginger?  That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off.  He's got no eyelids now.  How does he sleep with no eyelids?  All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?  QYBURN: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.  You're kidding me.  Apologies for the interruption,  but the queen did urge me to hurry.  Sorry, ladies.  Another time perhaps.  You ever get lonely, I am partial to older gentlemen.  Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.  [COUGHS.]  - Which girl? - QYBURN: The queen's brothers  made promises to you and broke them.  Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.  She once gave me a castle and a wife,  then rectified me right out of them.  That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.  When Queen Cersei wants something,  she pays in advance and in gold.  Several chests of it, in fact.  Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.  So she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers.  If it's the Dragon Queen she's after  She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.  Yeah, well, good luck with that.  Our queen's brothers are unlikely  to survive their Northern adventures.  But in the event that they do  [.]  She has a keen sense of poetic justice.  That fucking family.  QYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me,  I thought I would die poor and alone,  but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand.  What would she do for the man  who rids her of her treasonous brothers?  [.]  [DOOR OPENS, THEN CLOSES.]  [SIGHS.] I wanted those elephants.  [EURON SIGHS.]  So  how do I compare to the fat king?  You're insulting my late husband?  Are you offended?  Robert had a different whore every night,  but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.  And the Kingslayer?  You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?  [CHUCKLES.]  Life is boring.  You're not boring, I'll give you that.  [SIGHS.]  Do I please the queen?  You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met.  [WHISPERS.] I like that.  [CHUCKLES.]  [NORMALLY.] But now I want to be alone.  [SIGHS SOFTLY.]  [SOFTLY.] I'm going to put a prince in your belly.  [DOOR OPENS.]  [DOOR CLOSES.]  [BOW STRING CREAKS.]  [MEN GRUNTING.]  - [FLESH SQUELCHES.] - [GASPS.]  [PANTING.]  [GRUNTS.]  [BOTH GRUNT.]  [.]  YARA: Euron can't defend the Iron Islands,  not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.  We can take our home back.  Daenerys went north.  Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat  if they can't hold the North.  Somewhere the dead can't go.  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]  You're my queen. I go where you command.  You want to go to Winterfell.  To fight for the Starks.  Go.  What is dead may never die.  What is dead may never die.  But kill the bastards anyway.  [.]  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  WOLKAN: Welcome back, my lady.  If you'd follow me  VARYS: The Karstarks.  TYRION: One of the better sigils.  Beats an onion, anyway.  Can't argue with that.  Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks  were slaughtering each other on the battlefield.  Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.  TYRION: And our queen is grateful.  Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point.  The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her.  They don't know her.  The Free Folk don't know her.  I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you,  they're stubborn as goats.  You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  I sense that you're leading to a proposal.  A proposal is what I'm proposing.  On the off chance that we survive the Night King,  what if the Seven Kingdoms,  for once in their whole shit history,  were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?  TYRION: They do make a handsome couple.  VARYS: You overestimate our influence.  Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.  I'm not that old.  Not as old as him.  [CHUCKLES.]  Our queen respects the wisdom of age.  Of course she does.  Respect is how the young keep us at a distance,  so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.  TYRION: What is that?  Nothing lasts.  MAN: Hey!  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]  Your sister doesn't like me.  She doesn't know you.  If it makes you feel any better,  she didn't like me either when we were growing up.  She doesn't need to be my friend  but I am her queen.  If she can't respect me  [MAN SPEAKS DOTHRAKI INDISTINCTLY.]  [IN DOTHRAKI.]  [IN DOTHRAKI.]  What's the matter?  The dragons are barely eating.  [DRAGONS GROWLING SOFTLY.]  JON: What's wrong with them?  They don't like the North.  Go on.  I don't know how to ride a dragon.  Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.  What if he doesn't want me to?  Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.  [SCOFFS.]  [GRUNTS.]  What do I hold onto?  Whatever you can.  - [DRAGON CHITTERS.] - [JON GRUNTS.]  [.]  [GRUNTS.]  [JON YELPS.]  [YELLS.]  JON: Aah!  [.]  [GRUNTS.]  [WIND WHISTLING.]  You've completely ruined horses for me.  [LAUGHS.]  We could stay a thousand years  no one would find us.  We'd be pretty old.  [CHUCKLES.]  [.]  It's cold up here for a southern girl.  So keep your queen warm.  [DROGON GROWLS SOFTLY.]  Don't be afraid.  [EXHALES SHARPLY.]  MAN 1: That's good.  [MAN 1 SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY.]  [HAMMER CLANKING.]  - MAN 2: Gendry? - MAN 3: He's here.  It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.  You're saying you're good, is that it?  I'm just saying it's a tricky material to  You know who makes weapons for the wildlings?  Cripples and cocksuckers.  - Which one are you? - ARYA: Leave him be.  I heard you were here.  [.]  You left me to die.  First I robbed you.  You're a cold little bitch, aren't you?  Guess that's why you're still alive.  That was a nice ax you made for him.  You've gotten better.  Yeah, thanks. So have you.  I mean, you look good.  Thanks. So do you.  It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.  Stay close to that forge, then.  - Is that a command, Lady Stark? - Don't call me that.  As you wish, milady.  [MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY.]  [CHUCKLES.]  ARYA: Here's my wish.  Can you make it?  What do you need something like this for?  Can you make it or not?  You already have a sword. What's that?  It's Valyrian steel.  I always knew you were just another rich girl.  [MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY.]  You don't know any other rich girls.  [KNOCK ON DOOR.]  Come in.  [DOOR OPENS.]  [DOOR CLOSES.]  [SIGHS.]  Lord Glover wishes us good fortune,  but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.  "House Glover will stand behind House Stark  as we have for a thousand years."  Isn't that what he said?  SANSA: "I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.  "The King in the North."  I told you we needed allies.  SANSA: You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.  I never wanted a crown.  All I wanted was to protect the North.  I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.  And a Targaryen queen.  [SIGHS.] Do you think  we can beat the Army of the Dead without her?  I fought them, Sansa. Twice.  You want to worry about who holds what title,  I'm telling you it doesn't matter.  Without her, we don't stand a chance.  [SIGHS.]  Do you have any faith in me at all?  You know I do.  She'll be a good queen.  For all of us.  She's not her father.  [SIGHS.]  No, she's much prettier.  [SCOFFS.]  Did you bend the knee to save the North  or because you love her?  [DOOR OPENS.]  [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY.]  [CLEARS THROAT.]  Oh!  So you're the man?  Um  Which man am I, Your Grace?  The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.  They could, they just wouldn't.  DAENERYS: I'll have to make some changes  in the Citadel when I take my throne.  A great service merits a great reward.  SAMWELL: Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.  DAENERYS: Well, there must be something I could give you.  If it's not too much trouble,  I could use a pardon.  For what crime?  Um  I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.  And also a sword.  - From the Citadel? - SAMWELL: From my family.  It's been in House Tarly for generations.  It would've been mine anyway, eventually,  but my father had other ideas.  Not Randyll Tarly?  You know him?  I offered to let him retain his lands and titles  if he bent the knee.  [.]  DAENERYS: He refused.  [GULPS.]  Well  At least I'll be allowed home again,  now that my brother's the lord.  Your brother stood with your father.  [BREATHING SHAKILY.]  Hm.  Thank you, Your Grace.  For telling me.  And m  - May I? - Of course.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  [BREATHING HEAVILY.]  [SNIFFLES.]  [HORSE NEIGHS.]  [WHIMPERS.]  [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY.]  SAMWELL: What are you doing out here?  Waiting, for an old friend.  It's time to tell Jon the truth.  No, no.  You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?  I'm not his brother.  He trusts you more than anyone.  Now's the time.  [JON SIGHS.]  [MAN GRUNTING, THUDS.]  [MAN GROANING.]  JON: Sam?  I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.  - Were you hiding from me? - Of course not.  What are you doing in Winterfell?  Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?  What's wrong?  Gilly?
