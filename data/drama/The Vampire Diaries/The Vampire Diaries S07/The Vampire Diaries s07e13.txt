                    			1 - Previously on The Vampire Diaries - I want to feel pain.  I want to feel every miserable moment  of this miserable life.  What is this about?  What did you do?  I killed Elena.  I think these babies are siphons,  and I'm afraid they might be feeding off your blood.  As in they're literally siphoning the vampire magic  out of your body.  I found this in my mail.  It's a warning from Rayna Cruz.  Once you've been marked by her sword,  she never stops hunting you.  There's no stopping her. Ever.  This is your vicious,  terrifying, big bad huntress?  I knew if I sent those postcards,  one of the Heretics would lead me right to you.    What is that?  My tattoo you keep asking about.  La marca del cazador.  "The hunter's mark."  I traced it down to the line.  How come I can't see the real one?  Because the mark is only visible to the Brotherhood of the Five.  When do I get mine?  Hopefully never.  If I do my job right,  you will live in a world without bloodsuckers.  Now, get up.  I made stew.  No.  I will not eat.  Not until you teach me how to fight.  This should be about the right size for you.  Don't just look at it.  Prepare yourself.  Battles are won in the mind.  If you do not believe you can beat me, you never will.  This is no game, Rayna.  You want to survive,  show me you want to survive.  And never hesitate.  Vampires.  It's coming from Saint-Malo.  Let me go with you.  Not today, Nene.  This is my burden.  One day it may be yours  but it's not today.  Strong.  Easy, Luv.  You're just gonna hurt yourself.  Right.  We're going to have to sedate her.   I had me a boy, turned him into a man   I showed him all the things that he didn't understand   Whoa   And then I let him go   Now there's one in California   That's all the bourbon.  Vodka, you're up.   in the UK, hey, hey   Until I made my getaway   You want a Bloody Mary?  Or a Bloody Pamela?  AB negative.  Very rare.  They gonna run back to me   They always wanna come .   You got to go.  No, we're dancing.  No, we are not.  You. Leave. Now.  - What are you ? - I'll call you.  I need a drink and a buddy.  And currently you are my only buddy available to drink.  You'll notice I'm overlooking the fact  that you nearly killed me the last time we hung out,  so thanks for that.  Are you out of bourbon?  How's that possible?  Someone celebrating Julian's very timely demise?  Stefan didn't tell you?  Put a chair back through his heart.  That's an oldie but a goodie.  Hope he has enough chairs to take out the rest  of Julian's backup dancers.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're too debauched  to even notice he's missing.  Anyway, on the subject of people who have gone missing,  when was the last time you spoke to Enzo?  - Um - Because yesterday,  I got dragged into a very bad L Word rerun,  starring Nora and Mary Louise,  so we could track down Rayna Cruz, the big scary huntress  who, by the way, turned out to be 80 and senile  when all of a sudden, Enzo shows up out of nowhere  and steals her corpse.  - What is this? - Um  And don't tell me it belonged to Carol Lockwood.  Hey. Sorry it took so long to get back, but Damon  Caroline. Caroline  Caroline.  Perhaps this isn't the best time to mention  they ran out of cream.  - Sorry. - Don't be.  You have every right to be upset.  What did you tell them?  Oh, I compelled the doctors to ignore  - all things medicine couldn't explain. - Good.  I compelled a doctor to shut down this entire wing,  so it's just us.  Didn't want a vampire C-section to draw too much attention.  Has she regained consciousness?  No, not yet.  I gave her my magic.  I stopped the desiccation.  I knew she was sick, but I left anyway.  It almost killed her.  And what were you going to do?  Allow Damon to get his head ripped off  in a bloody fight ring?  Your brother needed you.  My brother doesn't care about anyone or anything.  He made that exceptionally clear yesterday.  Have you talked to anyone else about what he did to Elena?  Entire drive home, I was trying  to figure out a way to tell Caroline.  And I just couldn't find the words.  Look, right now, all you need to worry about is inside that room.  Caroline's going to have the babies.  Everything will be fine.  And all this will be over.  I'm sorry, I didn't I didn't quite hear that.  Was that Cr Crys ?  - Krystal. - Crystal.  - Krystal. - Got it.  With a "K."  Krystal with a "K," hmm.  Sounds like pure class.  With a "K."  Go ahead, let it all out, Bonnie.  I'm a vile cheater.  I couldn't even wait a year.  Are you kidding me?  The last thing anyone wants to deal with  for the next six decades is a cranky, bitter,  sexless Damon Salvatore, okay?  Elena would never do that to us,  which is why she gave you very clear instructions  to live your life.  And apart from your glaring lack of standards,  this isn't a bad thing.  Yeah, heard you got a thing for the grannies.  Huh, hilarious.  I'm looking for Bonnie.  She's not taking my calls.  Hold, please.  It's for you.  Tell him I don't deal with shady old-lady corpse stealers.  I'm sorry, she's busy.  I'm gonna have to take a message.  I'm looking for Rayna Cruz's sword.  Let's just say that it's beyond urgent.  He wants the sword.  Of course he does.  'Cause shady people like shady tchotchkes.  It's not happening.  Did you get all that?  Does Bonnie know what you did to Elena?  How you incinerated your true love  while she slept so soundly inside her casket?  Yeah, I'll take that as a no.  Reckon that's wise.  Oh, imagine if your precious Bonnie found out  that you gave Elena a Viking funeral.  It'd most certainly shatter that fragile and somewhat creepy  "frenemy" thing you two have going on.  Get the sword,  bring it to me at Whitmore,  or your best friend knows the truth.  So here's the thing, Bon-Bon.  What?  I'm gonna need a huge favor.  I'm on my way to the airport now.  I should be there in a few hours.  You don't have a few hours.  Caroline's stable, but the doctor  needs to perform the C-section now.  Okay, yeah, I-I-I-I-I get it.  Just do what you have to do.  But promise me you've got the best doctors in Virginia.  Just hurry back.  Scalpel?  Here you are, Doctor?  What's happening?  Doctor, are you all right?  What the hell was that?  No, don't touch that.  I think the babies want to stay where they can keep  feeding off Caroline as a source of magic.  I don't think they want to be born.    I commend you for your valiant,  but ultimately futile effort.  That was tragic you were unable to save  even one of these people.  Might've given your death some meaning.  But alas  Stop!  Rayna, no! Get out of here.  Let my father go.  Do you know what happens to obstinate daughters  who disobey their fathers?  Do you know what happens to vampires  who strike down one of the Brotherhood of the Five?  You are one of The Five?  If you kill him,  you'll be afflicted with the Hunter's Curse.  Plagued by madness  and driven to take your own life.  Well, that does create  quite a conundrum.  If I spare your life,  then you'll never cease trying to end mine.  Oh, I have another solution.  I will not kill your father.  You will.  - No, please! - Shh!  Shh, my dear.  Be strong.  Be brave.  Just as your father has undoubtedly taught you.  He's already dying.  Now it's up to you to put a swift  and merciful end to his misery.  Father  It's not your fault, Nene.  I can't stop.  I know.  It's his doing, not yours.  Never forget that.  Remember everything I taught you.  Use it.  Carry on my legacy.  And know that I'll be with you  every step of the way.  Great, now we have  the world's ugliest letter opener to give to Enzo.  Well, now that we've got this thing,  I want to know what Enzo has over you.  I'm just doing a solid for a bud, Bon.  Actually, I'm the one doing the solid.  You're the one making me do the solid  and now you're gonna tell me why.  Just leave it alone, Bonnie.  What did you do?  Couldn't be worse than whatever was wearing that jean skirt.  Fine.  Just don't be surprised  if I leave behind a really detailed journal entry  for Elena that's all about Krystal  with a "K."  Be my guest.  Damon, it's me.  I'm your best friend.  And when Alaric heads to Dallas, I might be your only friend.  You're right, Bonnie.  You are my best friend, which is why I can't tell you.  So I'm asking you leave it alone!  Thank you.  What do you mean they don't want to come out?  Valerie said the babies want to stay where the magic is.  And right now, that magic is in your blood,  which they're getting a steady stream of.  So what do we do?  Well, Valerie's plan is to channel enough magic  outside of your body so that the babies are drawn to it.  That way they don't resist  when the doctor tries to pull them out.  Funny, I didn't hear one medical word in all of that.  Could someone just call Bonnie?  I feel like she should be here.  I will call her.  And I promise  this will all be fine.  So, where's Dr. Valerie now?  She's getting help.  What do you mean "help"?  Uh, Nora, Mary Louise and Beau.  Oh, that is just perfectly reasonable.  Putting my life and the lives of these babies  into the hands of the people who tried to kill me.  Caroline?  I am not gonna let anything happen to you.  'Cause this isn't creepy or anything.  Got your damn sword.  This is the part where you say thank you.  Thank you.  Enzo?  Remember Thanksgiving of '53?  We were locked in neighboring cells,  and I told you I was thankful for you  through that little hole in the wall.  I take that back.  Like I had a choice.  I'm sorry.  You are ?  You don't recognize me.  Surprising since I've seen every Hunger Games.  Damon, Bonnie,  meet Rayna Cruz.  Not bad for an 80-year-old corpse.  No, I saw you.  You were old and sick and dead.  May I have my sword, please?  Ooh, looks and manners!  I am  Hey!  Stop or the next one's in her temple.  I don't care about you or him or her.  Give me my sword, and I'll be on my way.  You want your sword?  Go fetch!  Hear me, great spirit, hear me.  We call upon you in this moment of need.  We bring you an offering.  A woman who desires justice for herself,  for our tribe.  Drink.  She drinks the tea of protection  so that she may be strong  and so that no magic may touch her.  She accepts our singular lives,  so that she may have many.  I didn't ask for anyone to die.  No, they are not dead.  They live on within you.  Now  for the final step.  She wields a weapon of judgment,  one that thirsts for the blood  of those that prey upon us.  Link her spirit  with this sword.  This blade  draws blood from a vampire.  It will connect you.  It will guide you.  It will aide you in their destruction.  Wait!  Avenge your father.  Avenge us all.  She's only a bird in a gilded cage   A beautiful sight to see   What is keeping the others?  No doubt still cleaning up what's left of that barmaid.  Someone needs to be more discrete.  She's not   Though she seems to be.   Beau!  Beau!  Oh, my God.  You're going to be all right.  He's not healing.  We must get away from here.  Tell Lily to book passage  to New York Harbor immediately.  Ship sails tonight.  Julian, you're bleeding.  It's just a scratch.  Move now.  Let's go, come on.  Phesmatos sequitos in lucema infantesi mortuous.  Venis ad vitur.  Venis ad essendier.  Factuo partis viventia.  Wait, what do you mean, she's surrounded by Heretics?  You said you were taking care of her.  Yeah, and trust me, every possible way  you're second-guessing me right now, I've already done it.  This is our best chance.  Listen.  I know that this is totally crazy  and not what anyone expected or asked for, okay?  But what Caroline is doing for me  I am getting to have the family  that I thought I lost forever.  Please.  Now, you make sure that nothing happens to them.  Please.  I will.  Phesmatos sequitos in lucema infantesi mortuous.  Scalpel.  Venis ad essendier.  About to make the incision.  Phesmatos sequitos in lucema  Vitals are steady.  Infantesi mortuous.  Venis ad vitur.  Venis ad essendier.  Factuo partis viventia.  I think it's working.  Oh, my God, Beau.  It's his scar.  You didn't hesitate for one second  let alone three.  Thank you.  Of course.  We all good?  If so, I could use a little help with these ropes.  Do you hear someone talking?  I think I hear something.  Sounds like a low drone.  Sounds like a traitor.  Oh, right, yes, yes, a traitor.  That explains why I'm vervained to a theater seat.  Nora?  Did you let Rayna get the Phoenix Sword?  I didn't let her.  How do you know?  Beau's scar opened up,  which means she's coming for him.  She'll never stop coming for him.  Once she kills him,  she'll go after every other vampire in her path.  I need you to calm down. Where are you?  In the hospital.  With your friend, helping deliver her babies.  Wait, what?  We're all in danger, Bonnie.  Beau's scar is the mark from her Sword  and it will lead Rayna Cruz straight to him.  Once you've been marked, she'll chase you  to the ends of the earth,  until your soul is back in that stone.  Once she gets Beau,  she'll go after any other vampire in her path,  and right now this hospital's full of them.  Five milligrams.  Beau, don't despair.  We'll get you away from here, far away.  Beau's the one who's marked; why doesn't he just go?  And leave him to be hunted alone?  We have to protect each other.  We stay together.  I'm sorry, but I can't let you leave.  Look, you love Caroline and you don't want her to die.  I understand, because that is the way  I feel about Nora and she will,  we all will, if you do not get out of our way!  Stay and I'll do everything I can to protect you from this woman.  You don't stand a chance against her!  - None of us do! - She's right.  You have to let them go.  They can take Beau  and draw Rayna away from us.  The doctors are nearly finished.  I'll do what I can on my own.  You can't stay here.  Come with us.  These babies deserve a chance.  I can give that to them.  They could drain you, Val.  You could die.  I have to try.  Remember.  Never stop running.  Not for a moment.  Phesmatos sequitos in lucema infantesi mortuous.  Venis ad vitur.  Venis ad essendier.  Factuo partis viventia.  Phesmatos sequitos  in lucema infantesi mortuous.  Venis ad vitur.  Venis ad essendier.  Factuo partis viventia.  Kind of a bad time.  It's about to get a lot worse.  Hottie Huntress has the Sword and she's coming right for you.  Yeah.  Heard you were the one who gave it to her.  Impeccable timing,  considering Caroline literally couldn't be  any more helpless right now.  I'm working on that.  You know what? Don't bother, Damon.  Just sit there and do nothing  before you find a way to make this an even bigger problem.  What is he talking about?  What's going on? What don't I know?  Damon, why is he so mad at you?  I screwed up bad, Bonnie.  I gotta make it right.  We'll get to Richmond.  From there, we could fly  - as far from here as possible. - We'll keep moving.  Just like we did before.  Hurry.  Lily will have secured us passage by now.  I'm not journeying all the way across the ocean in a pine box.  Then you can stay here and be buried in one.  Whilst these accommodations might not be the grandest,  they have the benefit of being the least conspicuous.  She's here.  I do not know what hell awaits you inside this stone,  but it cannot be worse than the one you have put me through.  Aah!  Get us away from here.  No!  Hyah!  Venis ad vitur. Venis ad essendier.  Factuo partis viventia.  Phesmatos sequitos in lucema infantesi mortuous.  Venis ad vitur.  Venis ad essendier.  Factuo partis viventia.  Phesmatos sequitos in lucema infantesi mortuous.  Venis ad vitur. Venis ad essendier.  Such a gentleman.  Where are we?  Well, we're under the stars,  enjoying each other's company.  Are you  are you in my head right now?  Technically, yes,  but symbolically, we are on a date.  Will you pass me those fries, please?  Oh, this one is yours.  Extra pickles.  You're trying to distract me, aren't you?  Everything okay?  Is something going wrong with  No, no. Everything's fine.  I just  I figured you've had two lives inside of you for months,  lives that you didn't ask for,  lives that will change Ric's entire future.  So the least I can do is keep you company for a little while.  That's all.  Thank you.  She's here.  Phesmatos sequitos in lucema  infantesi mortuous.  How is she?  They're about to get the babies out.  What's wrong?  Beau didn't get away.  No.  No, that's not possible.  I'm so sorry, Valerie.  And what about the others?  I don't know.  But I think Rayna's somewhere inside this hospital.  Where's Damon?  Well.  You know,  you look a lot like my girlfriend  and her three doppelgÃÂ¤ngers.  Not to make things worse,  but my magic doesn't work on her,  and I don't think Damon can take her alone.  - Stefan, you have to go. - What are you talking about?  - I'm not gonna leave her. - I'll stay  and help Valerie.  Damon needs you.  I don't care what Damon needs.  I don't know what he did to make you hate him,  but he is so determined to make things right,  he's gonna get himself killed.  Do you honestly think I would do anything  to put Caroline at risk?  What the hell is going on here?  Stefan, go.  We can take it from here.  How we doing?  Almost there.  You want to send me back to hell?  Let me tell you something, lady.  I'm already there.  Stefan.  When I'm with you, I'm happy.  I totally get it  if you want to run for the hills.  I'm not going anywhere.  'Cause I love you.  Once a vampire's been marked,  she'll chase you to the ends of the earth.  I'll see you, brother.  Infantesi mortuous.  Venis ad vitur.  Venis ad essendier.  Okay, now's our chance.  The first baby is ready.  And now for baby number two.  Is she okay?  Yeah.  She's okay.  They're both okay.  Are you going to untie me?  It's tempting.  The ropes make it easier to kill you.  You're gonna kill me?  Look, mate,  I assure you  that giving Rayna Cruz the Phoenix Sword  was not on my list of things to do today.  Really?  You know what was on my list of things to do today?  Buy more bourbon.  That was it.  That was the most stressful part of my day.  And then you blackmailed me  and screwed me into this scavenger hunt  and now my brother's paying the price.  Rayna gave me no choice.  No choice?!  That's an interesting notion.  I'll tell you what.  Why don't we let fate decide what happens?  Heads, you live.  Tails,  you don't.  Elena's alive.  No, sir, she's not.  I watched her burn with my own eyes.  No, you weren't of sound mind.  You were hallucinating.  You saw what you wanted to see.  Really?  Tyler thought it best to have an empty decoy coffin.  So now you and Tyler are a dynamic duo?  Let's just say that we have  mutual friends  who have the real coffin  and the real Elena.  Take me to her.  She's in New York,  where my friends are keeping her very safe  and very much alive.  Good.  What happened?  Are they out?  Are they okay?  Everything's fine.  Babies are healthy.  They're with Alaric.  He took them to the nursery  to get them checked out.  They're okay?  They're better than that.  They're beautiful.  Where's Stefan?  What happened?  Where are you?  Not where I'm supposed to be,  which is with my girlfriend  who just gave birth.  Instead I'm running from a hunter  who won't stop chasing me until she's put down.  Why did you hand over that sword, Damon?  Elena's alive.  What are you talking about?  Long story with a hell of a punch line.  I didn't kill her, Stefan.  She's alive.  I got a second chance, brother.  And I will fix this.  I will.  I will kill that huntress with my bare hands if I have to,  and I will bring you back here, I promise.  I promise you.  I'm gonna hold you to that.  Hey. How are you?  Exhausted.  Hungry.  Lonely.  I'm sorry.  I wish I could be there.  This is the only way I could stop her.  I know.  I just wish it didn't always have to be you.  I promise I will come back for you.  I have to keep moving if I want to stay ahead of her.  I love you.  I love you, too.  Oh, my God.  You want to hold 'em?  Are you sure that's okay?  Yeah, Valerie said it shouldn't be a problem.  Something about the umbilical cord,  I don't know.  I was a little distracted.  This is Josie.  In honor of their mother.  And this  This is Elizabeth.  In honor of your mother.  Mommy?  Yeah, I just got on the 20.  Okay. Call me when you get there.  What about Stefan?  Just go.  Okay.  Um, okay.  Mommy?  Shh. Don't wake up your sister.  Where are we going?  To New Orleans.  To visit Mommy's friend.
