                    			Previously on The Vampire Diaries  Whatever's inside that vault  wants out.  And you have to promise me  you won't let Alex  set it free.  I promise.  Bonnie, please!  No one's getting out.  When she wakes, she'll be just like me  full of hatred for you and your kind.  You need to get as far away from her as you can.  Do you love him?  I don't know.  Can you love someone  and leave them behind,  right when you need each other the most?  I'm still mad at you.  You put me, quite literally, through hell,  and I'm not ready to let that go yet.  But don't think I'm not noticing  all the good you've been doing lately.  Bonnie's life is linked to that  of the final Everlasting. If we sever the link,  it might also sever the curse.  Unfortunately for us,  the Everlasting resides in the Armory.  The evil in the basement  escaped from its vault and could be anywhere.  We're gonna open the place back up.   You haven't heard from him?  Nope.  Which means, to absolutely no one's surprise,  Donovan failed and now Bonnie's huntressing in the wild.  All right, well, where is she now?  Coming after one of us.  Where else?  Weren't you meant to be on a plane?  Flights got cancelled because of the storm.  Where are you?  I'm in Solution Land, baby.  There's a preserved body at the Armory  called "the final Everlasting."  All we have to do is destroy that,  Bonster is a monster no more.  But if you kill the Everlasting,  Bonnie dies.  And so do we, for that matter.  I've been told differently.  By who? Someone that wants you dead?  A descendent of the people who created Rayna Cruz.  Yeah, the people who hate us.  Well, whether we believe them or not,  it's Bonnie's only chance.  Look  best case scenario, we destroy it,  everything goes back to normal.  Worst case scenario  we all die and Stefan lives to tell the tale  of our demise to the lovely Elena.  Are you forgetting about the other problem that's in there?  Oh, you mean the ambiguously terrifying  monster from the vault?  I'm on it.  Perhaps once it's less ambiguous,  it will be less terrifying.  Guys, it doesn't matter.  Bonnie sealed the whole Armory.  You can't get in.  Don't tell me what I can't do.  I can't get in.  Plan B.  Stefan, call your ex.  Obviously, not the one next to you.  Valerie.  She can siphon the seal.  That's great,  but I have absolutely no idea where to find her.  There is a third option.  And let me just tell you, it is just adorable.  The cutest little Plan C's  you've ever seen.  No!  Absolutely not.  All they have to do is walk up to the door  and put their tiny little siphon hands on it  No, my kids are staying out of this, Damon.  It's for Bonnie!  No, it's for us.  So that we don't have to run anymore.  And that is not a good enough excuse  to involve my children in this mess.  You know these scars that we have link her to us, huh?  She can probably hear what  we're saying right now.  We'll find Valerie.  Whatever, bro.  So what's it like when you see them?  I get snippets of conversations.  Some visuals.  But mostly, I can feel them.  Their emotions.  They're scared.  And they should be.  The urges are getting stronger.  I can feel it taking over.  I don't want to hurt them.  Then untie me.  Let me help you, okay?  I can stop you.  I know in my heart that I should.  Sorry, Matt.  My name's Enzo.  Bonnie's friend.  She didn't listen, did she?  After everything I said,  she still opened the vault?  It's complicated.  If that thing's allowed to get out in the world, we're  That's why I'm here.  We need to know exactly what we're dealing with,  so we can fight it.  You can't fight it.  You can't kill it.  It's been alive for thousands of years.  Don't be scared, love.  Now tell me what it is.  Then Lizzie had three cookies,  and I only had two.  Two and a half.  Wow.  This sure is a lot of cookie talk for 8:00 in the morning.  Yeah, well, the girls wanted cookies  and Daddy needed something to take his mind off things.  So you stress baked?  There's got to be a more masculine way  you could say that.  I miss you, Mommy.  I miss you, too, baby.  All right, wave good-bye, girls.  - Bye. - Bye.  Be safe.  They're three years old.  They shouldn't be involved in this world.  Not yet.  Lizzie siphoned me the other day.  The girls had their friend's birthday party,  and Lizzie took Josie's goodie bag.  I took it back from her and then she grabbed my arm.  She didn't mean to.  I just want them to have as normal a childhood  as possible.  It's your decision.  Period.  Thank you.  This doesn't let you off the hook, you know.  For the leaving or the kidnapping.  - No? - No.  Hmm.  Not even a a little bit?  Nope. Not even a little bit.  I feel a thaw.  There is definitely not a thaw.  Okay.  Bonnie?  I need you to drive faster.  Why? What happened?  I'm gaining on you.  Tell Stefan to drive faster  and don't stop.  How'd you catch up to us?  We have a police siren, okay?  It's been helpful.  Okay. We won't stop, I promise.  All units, we have a six-car pileup  on eastbound 60 at Franklin Drive.  Injuries reported. Please respond.  Tell me we're not on 60.  We're on 60.  Oh, no.  I got this.  Stefan?  Why do I feel you getting closer?  All you have to do is let us drive by you, Bonnie.  I can't do that.  Yes, you can. No, she can't!  Come on  I'm sorry.  No!  Let me guess, It's an ancient, tentacled evil  that will destroy our lives and the world as we know it.  Don't be ridiculous.  No tentacles.  Do I even want to know?  Will it deter you from going in?  Nope.  Then no, you don't.  Has anyone heard from Valerie?  Unnecessary.  Somebody has a plan.  Care to share?  It's messy.  I fear you've forgotten just how messy I can be.  Small runway a few miles east of the Armory.  Meet me there.  Bring your cowboy boots.  Do you think they're okay?  We have to assume they are.  And that she's still after us.  Any word from Damon?  Nothing.  Listen  you should get going.  You're not coming with me?  I haven't heard from Damon,  which means he probably has a plan that doesn't involve us.  Therefore, it can't be a good one.  I should handle it.  This was the best you could find?  Best, no. Closest, yeah.  Hey.  Where's the pilot?  Called him a few hours ago. He said he'd be here.  Well, he was, until you called and told him to forget it.  Except I didn't do that.  Are you Damon Salvatore?  Yes.  Well, that's who called.  You bring that pilot back before I rip your throat out.  Spot of turbulence?  More like interference.  Salvatore Airlines, may I help you?  You think you're clever?  Wow. Considering the fact that I tracked down you,  your pilot and your plan,  all in a little bit of brotherly intuition,  yes, Damon, as a matter of fact, I do.  Have you forgotten that I'm running from a hunter, Stefan?  I'm trying to get out of her way.  Oh, come on.  We both know that's not why  you're getting on the plane.  You have no idea what I'm up to.  Really?  Because I think you're headed to Dallas  to kidnap two innocent children.  Or I'm headed to Dallas to speak to their father  and talk some sense into him.  Hmm.  And if he says no?  Well, then, I will kidnap those two innocent children,  because that's the right thing to do.  No. The right thing to do  is to let Caroline, their mother,  decide what's best for them.  She's wrong, Stefan.  Well, it's her choice  and I'm gonna let her make it.  See ya.  Hey.  Hey.  Tell me.  Bonnie almost got us,  but I'm okay.  Look, you guys can't keep doing this.  You've got to find another way.  Damon and Enzo can fix her.  Well, that's great.  It involves Josie and Lizzie.  What?  What do they need?  To get into the Armory.  Lizzie and Josie could siphon Bonnie's spell.  I said no.  Instantly.  Because I thought it was just about me and Damon and Enzo,  and that's fine.  You know, I'm willing to run, they're willing to run  but then I talked to Bonnie on the phone and  she's scared, Ric.  And she's in pain.  But they're your kids  and I can't make that decision for them.  Well, they're not just my kids, Caroline,  they're our kids,  and that's a decision we need to make together.  She's my best friend.  I don't know what to do.  Well, look, it's been almost a week since the girls  have been able to hug their mother, so  if there's something we can do  to make sure it's not two weeks, or three,  or never  just tell me what it is we need to do.  Matt?  Matt, are you okay?  You okay?  Yeah.  Just stuck.  How about you? Are you okay?  Of course I am.  Because if I were dead, then this would all be over  and everyone could go back to their lives.  But we're not that lucky.  They'd be dead too, Bonnie.  They're marked.  If you die, they die.  So this is just gonna go on forever.  It's okay. I stopped you.  I can keep stopping you.  You're human, Matt.  You don't belong in this fight.  No, no, no, no.  Don't you leave me, Bonnie.  I'm sorry.  Bonnie!  Hello.  I'm hurt and I need help.  Is anyone out there?  Well, you're awfully quiet.  Don't tell me you're still mad about the pilot.  Caroline's bringing her kids, and we're gonna get inside,  and that's all that matters.  What happened to you, hmm?  You and I had a breakthrough yesterday.  You pulled a Damon.  You made the right choice, to hell with the consequences.  We actually agreed, Stefan.  I sent out a press release.  And then you spend one night with blonde ambition.  You're right back to your old, boring, choice-matters self.  What the hell, man?  Do you really think that I did the right thing  by taking Caroline against her will?  One hundred percent.  You said that's how you know you love someone.  And for a second there,  I actually, I actually believed you.  I thought that my love for Caroline was so strong  that I would do anything to protect it.  But then I realized, that's not love, Damon.  That's fear.  You should put that on a greeting card.  That night  that you put yourself down,  it wasn't because you loved Elena.  It was because you were afraid if you didn't,  you would do something terrible,  and you would lose her forever.  And that fear,  that fear was so powerful  that it overrode any love that you felt for me  or Bonnie or anybody else.  It wasn't about you, Stefan.  Oh, it had absolutely everything to do with me.  No.  I looked you in the eyes, Damon,  and I begged you to stay.  And you turned your back on me like it was nothing.  And I thought about that yesterday,  when I "pulled a Damon."  And I realized  I never want to be that person.  I refuse to be ruled by fear.  I refuse to be you.  They're here.  You guys know why we're here?  Because there's something inside this building  that's really important that we need.  The only problem is these doors are locked,  so we're gonna need your help to open them, okay?  Want to know something cool?  You two are special because you two  are the keys.  Let's play a game.  Everyone put one hand on the door.  Remember Amy's birthday party?  I took away your goodie bag, and what happened?  I hurt you.  Yes, because I took something from you.  Now  how would you feel if someone tried to take me away from you?  Mad.  Sad.  Yeah, me, too.  And if we don't get inside of here, that might happen.  I might never be able to  see you or hug you or  tuck you in at night.  It's working.  Keep going, girls.  Good job.  Good job!  You did so good.  You both did such a good job.  It's all over.  Calling to  apologize from my leg?  I know what you're planning.  I can see everyone waiting at the Armory.  They're sitting ducks, Enzo.  Yeah, except not everyone is waiting at the Armory.  What are you doing?  My part.  I need a favor from you.  I need you to think about me.  - No. - All right, I'll pretend  that doesn't hurt my feelings.  Look, I know your urges are strong  and you can't control them, but you can  focus them.  Chase me, and only me,  and it'll give our friends some time to sort all this out.  I'll catch you, Enzo.  Give me some credit.  Come on, love.  I'll lead you on a little, wild goose chase.  Okay.  I see you.  Now come and get me.  Where are the little squirts?  Away from whatever's gonna come out of there.  Well, for something to get out we have to be able to get in.  Nice.  Shall we?  Stefan  Whatever you're about to say, just  say when this is over.  Wow, this looks  promising.  Meh  I've seen worse.  So this thing the was in the vault  that no one was supposed  to open, do we know  what it is?  Yup.  - Bad. - Ah.  Enzo says that the final Everlasting  is in a coffin somewhere.  So let's just find this thing and get the hell out of here.  Why did you stop?  I was running out of gas,  which means you were gonna catch up to me eventually.  I cannot begin to know what you're feeling  but I thought, if you came here  - Enzo - maybe we could share  a meal and a drink,  one last time.  You know I can't do that.  Come on.  My risotto isn't that bad.  I'm so sorry.  Huh  maybe it is.  This is appropriately creepy.  Enzo said don't go in the vault.  Ahh, we've searched everywhere else.  You know, if you're scared, Damon, you can go, uh,  wait outside with the three-year-olds.  Damon.  You ready to do this or what?  Yeah.  Yes, I am.  But I'm gonna do it alone.  Like hell you are.  Whatever's down there is nobueno.  Which is why you need me.  Let me do this, Stefan.  There is a girl waiting outside for you,  and if you go in there with me, and get all screwed up,  you're gonna have problems with her, and you're gonna blame me.  I don't care.  I can help you.  I know you can  and you have.  Over and over again,  you've helped me.  And over and over again, it's screwed you,  and so, this time, I need a different kind of help, okay?  I need you  to let me go.  Let me succeed or let me fail  but let me do it by myself.  I'm sorry I walked out on you that night.  You're right, I was scared.  And I knew you'd be mad,  but I also knew that you'd be okay.  I know my choices suck sometimes, and you like  to be there to head them off at the pass, but this time  I need you to believe in me.  Okay?  Damon, I  You don't want a life ruled by fear?  Huh?  Then, this time  you walk out on me,  and don't be afraid of what'll happen.  Trust I'll be okay.  One way or another  I'll be okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Listen, if-if you need me, I'll be  Right outside.  Yeah.  Oh, God, it's been too long.  Oh, my God, thank God.  Where's Damon?  It's not over yet.  I can't move.  I know.  No, you don't want to do this.  Fight me.  Fight me!  Push me off of you.  I'm trying  but I dare say you've gotten stronger.  Hold me back.  Please, please.  I'm afraid I'm at my limit.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Enzo.  It's okay, it's okay.  But I need one thing from you.  When this is over, don't remember this moment.  Remember the other ones:  New Year's Eve  and champagne  and your terrible, terrible  guitar playing that never really got any better,  even though I said it did.  and remember  that I had over a century of pain and loneliness  before I found you  and then three  glorious years of love.  I love you.  I love you, Enzo.  There you are.  I can't hold back anymore.  You don't have to.  Come on!  He did it.  Damon did it.  He did it, he did it.  No more scar.  Yeah I guess he did it.  I'm gonna take the kids home.  Good. I'll get  - my stuff and - No.  No, you should, uh,  you should stay.  You changed my life  you know that, right?  I mean, you completely turned it around.  And for that, I, uh  I will always love you.  Even though I know you don't love me the same way.  - Ric - It's okay.  I mean, to be honest, I always knew.  It's just that, you know, we  we had these moments where we were  just  perfectly in sync.  You know, laughing at the kids or  in tears because we were so exhausted, I  I guess, uh  I don't know, I guess a part of me thought  that maybe, one day, those moments  might become something more.  But that wouldn't be fair to you.  Certainly wouldn't be fair to me, either.  I'm so sorry.  No.  A part of me just  loved the idea of a perfect, happy family.  And I didn't want to let that go.  You should be happy.  I mean, you deserve everything you want.  And no matter what happens, Caroline,  you, me, the kids  we're a family  and we will always, always be a family.  This is quite the mess, isn't it?  Penny  This isn't real.  Really?  As screwed up as your life is, you're not even  going to consider that I could be a ghost?  I'm so sorry. I didn't mean  I know. I know.  You're a terrible shot.  We established that years ago.  How the hell did you get yourself into this one?  I just can't escape this life.  That's the thing, Matt.  You haven't really tried.  So what do you want to do?  I just want to be with you.  Please take me with you.  Sorry, Matt.  You don't belong with me, either.  There's a better life for you out there.  You just have to wake up and find it.  Wake up.  Wake up!  He's conscious.  You lost a lot of blood, but it's going to be okay.  Just stay with me. Everything's going to be okay.  He's Damon.  He's like a cockroach.  He always survives.  You're still here.  I still had some things I wanted to say to you  when this was over.  He's okay.  He always is.  So, um, I guess whatever you wanted to say to me,  you can say it now.  I lied earlier.  There was a thaw.  If you think this means you're forgiven  I am so forgiven.  You're kind of forgiven.  Uh, would it have killed you to have done it,  I don't know, five minutes  sooner?  Wait Enzo's still alive?  Damn. I thought I waited long enough.  Thank you.  Thank me in person with gifts and  Damon  Hello?  Hang on.  Damon  Elena?  What did you just say?  I can hear her in the vault.  Damon.  Elena is in a warehouse in Brooklyn.  I know, but  Damon, help me.  What if something happened to her?  What if the Armory took her?  They didn't.  Please  I just have to make sure.  Damon! Get out of there!  Please, help me.  I'm so alone.  I need you.  Where are you?  Right here.  - Where is he? - The vault.  But he closed the security door.  So open it.  No, we can't.  Only someone from the Armory can.  Why didn't you bring Enzo?  I did.  Damon?  Just you?  I snuck off.  Didn't feel like playing scissors, paper, stone  over who was going to save your life.  That's very heroic of you.  I don't leave people behind.  Not my style.  Plus, my girl seems to think that you're her best friend.  And, uh from what I can tell,  heroes always do right by their girl.  Then I should warn you  it doesn't always work out so great.  Had a feeling.  But don't worry  it's not as bad as you think.  It only hurts at first.  Then, after that  it's kinda fun.  Dear Elena, we were so close.  Stefan and I had finally worked through our problems.  Bonnie and Enzo were on the verge of being happy,  and Damon  Damon actually did the right thing.  The selfless thing.  We waited in that room for days.  Stefan didn't sleep.  Throwing everything,  including himself, at that door,  trying to get it open.  After a week, Alaric managed to crack the security code.  We were prepared for almost anything  except what we saw.  It was empty.  Enzo?  Completely cleaned out.  I don't know how they got out, but they did.  Enzo!  I'm worried about Bonnie.  She lost the two people closest to her,  and she can't even do a locator spell to find them.  Her magic never came back.  She feels hopeless.  I reached out to all my contacts,  knowing they'd show up sooner or later.  I owed 'em that much.  Then I left.  Because as sad as it is, this isn't my fight.  And if I'm ever going to be happy,  I have to recognize which ones are.  It was three months  before we heard the first rumor  a string of missing persons on the West Coast.  It was encouraging.  But then the numbers kept growing.  20, 50, 60 people missing.  It's them. I know it.  I don't know what's wrong with them,  or what they're doing, or why  but I promise you,  we'll get him back.  Just know that whatever happens between now and then  it's not his fault.  There you are.  Aw, did you miss me?  Never gets old, does it?  It sure as hell hasn't yet.
