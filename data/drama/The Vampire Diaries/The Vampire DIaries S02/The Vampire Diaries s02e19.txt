Previously on The Vampire Diaries: - You must be Elena.
- How do we look alike? Petrova doppelganger, the key to breaking the curse.
Sun and Moon curse? Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them.
- Klaus is the real deal.
- First generation.
The oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me? - Katerina, I have missed you.
- Klaus.
Klaus is in Alaric's body.
He's possessing it.
Now, while I'm gone, you stay here, Katerina.
- Elijah.
- One of the Originals.
A legend.
- Uhn! - So that's it.
As long as we keep the dagger in, he stays dead? Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed if a witch could channel enough power, they wouldn't need one.
Says if you use too much powers, it'll kill you.
Bonnie won't die for me.
I won't let that happen.
- She's the only one who can do it.
- We'll find another way.
Elijah.
Elijah.
Katerina.
Excuse me.
Ah.
Good evening, Trevor.
Pleased you could join us.
I could not miss the birthday celebration.
No, considering the gift you claim to bear.
Where is this mystery girl of which you speak? Right this way.
My dear.
Hello.
Elijah.
It's me.
It's Elena.
- Please.
- Shh.
Oh, my God.
Forgive me.
You remind me of someone.
Katerina, may I introduce the Lord Elijah.
- A pleasure, my lord.
- The pleasure is mine, Katerina.
I can't I can't breathe.
What's happening to me? L I can't I can't I can't be in this house.
You're not invited in.
Get me out of here.
- What happened? - Shh.
I'll tell you.
Not here.
Can I trust you? Can I trust you? Elena? - Hey.
- Hey.
- Have you seen Elena? - Uh No.
Mm-mm.
Hi, sweetie.
Oh, my coffee.
- Good morning.
Mm.
- Mm.
Good morning.
- Where's Elena? - Don't know, Stefan.
She's your girlfriend.
Mine's right here.
Hey, how's the shoulder? Do I have time for a bite? I'm so hungry.
It's really messy.
Can you just use a blood bag today? - I'm already late for work.
- No.
Hey, it's me.
Where are you? Call me.
What are you doing? She's not a wind-up toy.
It's really none of your business, is it, Stefan? Yeah.
What she said.
- Mm.
- I have to go to work.
- Oh, fine.
- Okay.
No, she didn't.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yes, do hurry.
I'm anxious to get out of this body.
And if you get hung up, call me.
You know how impatient I get.
Where is he going? To retrieve me.
So I can get out of this bad hairdo.
Are you sure that's a good idea, Klaus? Well, the full moon is almost upon us.
I've killed the witch, I have the moonstone and the doppelganger is waiting in the wings.
I am ready to break this curse.
And why would you do that here? There are so many that would try to stop you.
Because I have to.
It's the birthplace of the doppelganger.
- Didn't realize that was a requirement.
- How could you? You betrayed me and fled England before I could give you the details, Katerina.
But I did find your birthplace and I slaughtered your family so I guess we're cool.
Let's just hope that Elena isn't as stupid as you were.
She won't run.
She'll die before she lets anyone that she loves get hurt.
And that's exactly what I'm counting on.
You can't leave until I tell you to.
You look better.
Where did you get the dagger? I'll tell you everything but we have to work together, Elijah.
I need your word.
Your ability to make demands has long passed.
No demands.
I'm offering you my help.
And in return, I want yours.
And why should I even consider this? The same reason that you haven't killed me.
You need my help to kill Klaus.
And I need you.
STEFAN Where are you? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine.
- Where's Elijah? - He's right here.
Where? I'm on my way.
No, Stefan.
Elijah and I need some time alone.
Listen to me.
He can't be trusted.
He'll use you to get to Klaus.
Elijah is a noble man, Stefan.
He lives by a code of honor.
I can trust him.
He knows that I'd be incredibly stupid to betray him again.
By removing the dagger, I have proven myself.
You can't do this alone.
It's my decision, Stefan.
Please respect it.
And make sure that Damon doesn't do anything stupid.
I'll be in touch.
- Did she just hang up on you? - She did.
She's lost it.
If anyone can get him to help us kill Klaus, it's her.
Bonnie's the way.
He thinks she's dead, we've a chance with her.
She'll kill herself.
Elena's looking for a way.
Her way is gonna get her killed.
So we need to find her and stop her.
- No, you need to back off.
- What? I don't like this any more than you, but we need to trust her.
- We gotta just let her do her thing.
- That might be your plan, mine's better.
I said, back off.
He's here.
Klaus is here? He's taken over Alaric's body.
Of course he has.
One of his favorite tricks.
Well, what are his other tricks? What is he gonna do next? You're the only one who knows him.
Yes, I do.
So where is the mysterious host I have heard so much about? Fashionably late.
He likes to make an entrance.
Here he is.
Katerina, may I introduce to you the Lord Niklaus.
Niklaus is the name my father gave me.
Please call me Klaus.
Elijah? Elena? What are you doing here? What happened? I've had a bit of an incident, Carol.
I'm hoping you could help.
Well, I'm on my way to a meeting so I won't take but a minute of your time.
Of course.
Anything you need.
Thank you.
Well, first things first.
I'm going to need a change of clothing.
Well, we could try one of my husband's suits.
I haven't boxed them up yet.
Wonderful.
How did you know she's not on vervain? Because I'm the one who got her off it.
Right before you and your friends killed me.
Twice.
If you excuse me, I'll be down in a moment.
- Hello? - Hey, Stefan, it's Jenna.
Jenna, hey.
Where's Elena and Jeremy? No one's answering their phones.
Elena's not here at the moment.
Is everything okay? She left me weird messages telling me to stay away from Ric.
What's going on? Hard to explain over the phone but she was hoping you could stay on campus a little while longer.
Well, that's kind of hard to do from my kitchen.
Wait.
You're home? Yeah, what's going on? Where's Elena? I'm to meet Ric at the Grill for lunch to talk.
Jenna, listen carefully.
Whatever you do, do not meet Alaric at the Grill.
I'm gonna come over now and I'll explain everything.
I'd love to lend you a hand but you wouldn't want me to do anything stupid.
You seriously gonna be like this? You and your girlfriend are calling the shots.
I'm just backing off, Stefan.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Let's go.
- Where are we going? - We're splitting from the team.
- Going rogue.
- Ooh.
Come on.
So I assume that the Martin witches are no longer with us? No.
- I'm sorry.
- And Katerina? She would have been released from my compulsion when I died.
Klaus took her.
We think she may be dead.
I doubt that.
Not Klaus's style.
Death would be too easy for her after what she did.
I don't understand.
You say that you want Klaus dead but you still made Katherine pay for betraying him.
I have my own reasons for wanting Katerina to pay.
There was a time I'd have done anything for Klaus.
From where have you come, Katerina? I am new to town, my lord.
Katerina is from Bulgaria.
Very good.
Ha-ha.
Do you mind, brother? I would like to have a moment alone with her.
No, not at all.
Happy birthday, brother.
Yes.
Klaus is my brother.
I heard that.
I'm still processing.
Yes, I'm a little behind on the times but I believe the term you're searching for is OMG.
Sometimes life It takes you by the hand It puts you down before you know it It's gone and you're dead again I've been in places And I won't pretend That I make it I just follow my head I don't think that this is a good idea.
You're an investigative journalist.
We're investigating.
Hi, Alaric, you home? It's Andie Star, Jenna's friend.
I tie my hands up to a chair So I don't fall that way Yeah yeah And I'm alright But I'll hold on tight - Thank God.
- Wow.
You were right.
She looks exactly like Elena.
Yep.
Uhn.
Thought you might be dead.
Unfortunately not.
Hey, Jenna.
Thank you so much for not going to the Grill.
- Uh, Stefan - No, listen, I can explain.
Hi, Stefan.
How's it going? There's a whole family of Originals? My father was a wealthy landowner in a village in Eastern Europe.
Our mother bore seven children.
So your parents were human? Our whole family was.
Our origin as vampires is a very long story, Elena.
Just know, we're the oldest vampires in the world.
We are The Original Family and from us, all vampires were created.
Right, but Klaus is your brother.
And you want him dead? I need some air.
I'm still feeling a tad dead.
Come.
- What are you doing here? - We are here to rescue you.
No, sweetie, we are here to see if she deserves to be rescued.
Right.
I figured you still might be kicking.
Alari-Klaus was blending way too easily.
I figured he had probably had some coaching.
- Is that? - Vervain, your salvation.
It's not gonna undo anything.
There's always a loophole.
Did he tell you to stay until he said it was okay to leave? You can't say.
Did he tell you to do absolutely everything he says until the end of time? No.
There's your loophole.
Drink this and it will prevent any further compulsion.
- Give it to me.
- Answer one question first.
You double-crossed us with Isobel.
Why? I didn't think you stood a chance against Klaus.
- I was looking out for myself.
- And where did that get you? Here.
Be careful with that.
If he finds out you have that, you're never getting out here.
You owe me.
And I will collect.
Come on.
Nice to meet you.
You know, I find chopping calming.
Feel of the blade in the hand maybe.
I'm still waiting for someone to tell me what the hell's going on.
Well, would you like to tell her, Stefan, or should I? Tell me what? Do you believe in vampires, Jenna? No? Ha-ha.
Well, who does, right? But, believe it or not, they do have a place in our history.
And, as a history teacher, I find them fascinating.
Why are we talking about this? You've been angry with me for keeping secrets and this is one of my secrets.
I'm obsessed with vampires.
There, I said it.
Ha-ha.
- Are you joking? - Not at all.
How about you, Stefan? Are you a fan of vampires? In literature.
Bram Stoker? It's dense but I appreciated it.
Did you know that vampires are the oldest creatures of the night? Except for werewolves, of course.
Werewolves? Werewolves.
Now I know you're joking.
You know, I've read that there's an Aztec curse on both species that keeps werewolves slaves to the moon and vampires bound by the sun.
Isn't that right, Stefan? They say these creatures would do anything to have this curse broken.
And that they wouldn't care who they had to kill to do it.
So as you've seen, nothing can kill an Original.
Not sun, not fire, not even a werewolf bite.
Only the wood from one tree.
A tree my family made sure burned.
That's where the white ash for the dagger comes from.
Yes.
The witches won't allow anything truly immortal to walk the Earth.
Every creature needs to have a weakness in order to maintain balance.
So if the sun can't kill an Original why is Klaus so obsessed with breaking the Sun and Moon curse? Right.
The Curse of the Sun and the Moon.
It's all so biblical sounding, don't you think? What's so funny? Oh, look.
A Roman parchment.
I remember etching this scroll.
I was quite blistered from drink.
Your finest work remains your Aztec drawings.
Not the African carvings? Because I was quite proud of those.
The Aztec.
Who can resist a shaman? Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, yes.
I don't understand.
So Klaus drew the Aztec sketches about the curse? Roman scrolls, African tribal etchings and any other culture or continent we felt like planting it in.
But why? The easiest way to discover the existence of a doppelganger or to get your hands on some long-Iost moonstone is to have every single member of two warring species on the lookout for it.
So it's not Aztec at all? The Curse of the Sun and the Moon is fake.
It doesn't exist.
What? Oh, I know this all sounds so crazy.
But vampires are real.
Would you care for some more wine? - Get out.
- Excuse me? I don't know what you're trying to do or why you're saying this but - Jenna - I said, get out.
You heard her.
I'm afraid I don't want to.
- Fine, I'll go.
- You're not going anywhere.
- Stefan.
- Jenna, get out of here now.
- You can't kill me.
- Watch me.
- Stefan.
- I may not have a witch protecting me but if you kill this body, what's to stop me from choosing Jenna? - Jenna, go.
- But, you I said, go! Kill me.
Remind Elena how easy it will be for me to get revenge if she tries to stop me from breaking this curse.
Klaus and I faked the Sun and Moon Curse dating back over a thousand years.
- But if there's no curse - There's a curse.
Just not that one.
The real one's much worse.
It's a curse placed on Klaus.
What are you talking about? Klaus has been trying to break it the last thousand years and you are his hope.
Well, what is this curse? Your phone will not stop its incessant buzzing.
Answer it, please.
Stefan What's wrong? No.
No, no, no, l Okay, I'll be right there.
Klaus went after Jenna.
I have to go to her.
That's not part of the day's arrangement.
She's my family, Elijah.
I have to.
I'll be back.
You have my word.
That doesn't mean anything to me until you live up to it.
Thank you.
- I won't.
- Well, you have to chase me.
You're meant to catch me.
Well, if I catch you, the game will be over.
Thank you for entertaining me.
Oh, you looked Ionely inside so I took pity on you.
Klaus promised to spend the day with me but he never returned home from the night.
Because Klaus does not live by any rules but his own.
He is a very charming man.
Hard for any woman to resist, I suppose.
And yet? I know not why he courts me.
He seems to not care about me at all.
Many a union has been built on much less.
Is it wrong to want more? - Do you have more with Trevor? - Trevor believes that he loves me.
But true love is not real unless it is returned.
Do you agree? I do not believe in love, Katerina.
That is too sad for me to accept, my lord.
Life is too cruel.
If we cease to believe in love, why would we want to live? - What do I interrupt? - He's returned.
Long night? What has happened? The wrong villager picked a fight at the tavern.
Oh, Jenna, thank God.
No.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for any of this to happen.
When I was little, your mom used to tell me bedtime stories.
Stories about vampires.
I never thought that what she said could be true.
It is true, Jenna.
I should have told you.
I thought that if you didn't know, you'd be safe.
But then things got so out of control and everything I'd done to keep you out of it blew up in my face.
Who else knows? Jeremy? John? We were just trying to protect you.
- Protect me? - I'm so sorry, I will tell you everything.
No, Elena, I am the one who is supposed to be protecting you and Jeremy.
I know.
But there's nothing that you could have done.
- There's so much more to it - No, this is like This is so I don't know how l Hey, I know.
Hey.
Why didn't you tell me? - I'm scared.
- I know.
Oh, I know.
I know, hey.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Jenna, I'm so, so sorry.
Is she gonna be okay? She's in shock.
I tried to tell her as much as I could but I barely scratched the surface.
I'm so sorry, Elena.
I hate this.
It's not your fault, Stefan.
It's mine.
Anyway, I have to go back to Elijah.
Wait, what? No, no.
Stefan, I promised him that I would return.
I can't break that promise.
I'll be okay.
- Where do you think you're going? - Back to Elijah.
- No.
- Get out of my way, Da If you so much as try and take a step out of this house - Easy.
- Stay out of this, Andie.
- Let her go.
- Are you kidding? We just got her back.
You heard me.
I said, let her go.
That's twice today you've stood in my way.
I wouldn't try a third.
Like a shotgun Needs an outcome You gon' get some Go ahead, go way low Where I can do no harm Go ahead, go way low In my honey lovin' arms Go ahead, go way low Where I can do no wrong Got you around my finger Like a Ionely lover's charm Go ahead, go Go ahead, go You mind turning that down? Go ahead, go Go ahead, go Why so grumpy? Well, this body has outlived its usefulness.
Do you want a drink? - No, Katerina, I don't want a drink.
- Come on.
It might loosen you up.
What I want is for you to sit down and shut up.
Maddox, what took you so long? You got a lot of luggage.
Greta.
Finally.
- Hello, love.
- Hello.
Nice body.
- You ready to get out of it? - Mm-hm.
Welcome back.
Tell me.
What is Klaus's curse? Please.
You know, my family was quite close.
But Klaus and my father did not get on too well.
When we became vampires, we discovered the truth.
Klaus was not my father's son.
My mother had been unfaithful many years before.
This was her darkest secret.
Klaus was from a different bloodline.
Of course, when my father discovered this he hunted down and he killed my mother's lover and his entire family.
Not realizing, of course, that he was igniting a war between species that rages until this day.
A war between the species? The vampires and the werewolves.
So Klaus's real father was from a werewolf bloodline? What does that make Klaus? A werewolf or a vampire? He's both.
A hybrid would be deadlier than any werewolf or vampire.
Nature would not stand for such an imbalance of power.
Therefore the witches, the servants of nature, saw to it that my brother's werewolf side would become dormant.
That's the curse Klaus wants to break? He wants to trigger that part of him that's werewolf.
If allowed, Klaus would sire his own bloodline.
He'd build his own race endangering not just vampires but everyone.
- But you helped him.
- I helped him because I loved him.
That's changed now.
He must die.
We have the dagger.
We can stop him.
When a werewolf is wounded by silver, it heals.
An Original can't be killed by anything but white oak ash on silver dagger.
See the conundrum? The dagger does not work.
What are you saying? Klaus can't be killed? There's one way to kill any supernatural species.
At the hands of the servants of nature themselves.
A witch.
If they can channel that much power.
But it would kill them.
The curse must be broken during the full moon when Klaus is in transition.
That's when he'll be at his most vulnerable.
A witch with enough power can kill Klaus.
What if I told you that I knew a witch that could channel that much power? Then I would tell you there's one more thing that you should know.
The full moon is tomorrow, brother.
After all these centuries, it is finally time.
I have been to see the witches.
They believe they may have found a way to spare the doppelganger.
What does it matter if she lives or not? She is a means to an end.
That is all.
But she should die for your gain? She is human.
Her life means nothing.
I beg you to consider this.
Are you so foolish as to care for her? Of course not.
Love is a vampire's greatest weakness.
And we are not weak, Elijah.
We do not feel and we do not care.
We did once.
Too many lifetimes ago to matter.
Tell the witches not to bother.
The sacrifice will happen as planned.
You found a way to save the life of the doppelganger? Yes, Elena.
I did.
Unfortunately, Katerina took matters into her own hands first.
I believe you already know how that played out.
You cared about her, didn't you? It's a common mistake, I'm told.
It's one I won't make again.
You don't have to be so mad at your brother.
You know, he's just worried about Elena and Just go.
Please.
- I know you're worried about her too.
- Andie.
Go.
Okay.
- Tired of your plaything already? - Don't start with me, Stefan.
She's just my distraction.
She's a person.
You're victimizing her.
You should be thankful she's here.
She keeps me from going for what I really want.
You're right.
Thank you for being in love with my girlfriend.
And there it is.
There it is.
You know, you can be in love with Elena all you want.
If it means that you'll protect her.
But I have the one thing that you never will.
Oh, yeah? What's that? Her respect.
Stop.
What have you done? I don't understand.
Katerina is gone.
She has fled.
No.
- What did you tell her? - Nothing.
Do not lie to me! I will find her.
You have my word.
If you do not I give you my word.
You will be dead.
Now you've invited him in? Elijah and I renewed the terms of our deal.
Really? The two of you will come to no harm at my hands.
I only ask for one thing in return.
- What? - An apology.
A what? I'm sorry for the part that I played in your death.
I was protecting Elena.
I will always protect Elena.
I understand.
The sacrifice is going to happen, Damon.
Bonnie will kill Klaus without hurting herself and Elijah knows how to save my life.
I told you I'd find another way.
And I did.
- Is that true? - It is.
- And you're trusting him? - I am.
You can all go to hell.
He's angry with me right now.
But he'll come around.
Perhaps.
I thought I told you to leave.
You didn't compel me.
I want to be here.
Just let me be here.
I'm upset.
You know happens when I'm upset.
You have to leave.
No.
You need to know that somebody cares about you.
I care about you, Damon.
You Andie.
Look at me.
Get out of here before I kill you.
Just go.
Go.
Now! Elena? Now that's more like it.
