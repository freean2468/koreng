Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
- What are you? - I'm a vampire.
He told me about your ex.
- Katherine, she broke your heart.
- That was a long time ago.
How do we look exactly alike? I don't want you seeing Elena anymore.
If you don't remove her from your life, I will kill everyone that she loves.
She wants us to fight.
She wants to get between us.
She already has, Elena.
Katherine.
We're gonna have so much fun together.
The Lockwoods are werewolves.
The werewolf gene runs in the Lockwood family.
- Tried to kill a werewolf and failed.
- Unh! I feel like I'm not living up to my best self.
Now you made an enemy.
- Tell me what triggers the curse.
- You have to kill somebody.
All right, Carlos, that's it for me.
You got it.
Good night.
Are you with us Or against us? - Mason.
- Whoa.
Hey, Jimmy, easy.
- Let's get you home.
- Screw you.
- I know about you and Marla.
- What are you talking about? You've had too much to drink, let's Dude, what's up? It's me, Mason.
I'm not messing with Marla.
You know that.
- You don't wanna do this, buddy.
- I'm gonna kill you.
Jimmy.
Jimmy.
Wait.
The guy died? You killed him? He kept coming at me, got it in his head that I was sleeping with his girlfriend.
- Well, were you? - No, no.
I wouldn't do that.
He was my friend.
He was drunk and attacked me.
It was self-defense.
And it triggered the curse.
On every full moon, I lose control.
If I don't sedate myself and chain myself down I'll kill anything in my path.
You have to be careful.
All it takes is an accident, a car wreck.
Any death at your hands and you'll have a lifetime of this.
You don't want it, Tyler, trust me.
All right, where's the moonstone? Deal's a deal.
I answered your questions.
Um Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'm guessing it's in here.
My dad, he was very kooky about his hiding spots but I've figured most of them out over the years.
It's all yours.
You gonna tell me what's so important about this rock? I told you, it's just something I want.
Sentimental value.
Yeah, I'm not really buying that.
- Why do you really want it? - Do you know where it is or not? No, I figured it'd be in here, man.
I can't believe Tyler Lockwood's a werewolf.
We're not sure about that yet.
The only thing we know for sure is that Mason Lockwood is.
That should be easy enough for us to figure out.
There is no us.
I said that I wouldn't keep things from you anymore.
That doesn't mean that I want you involved in it.
By definition of being in this family, I'm involved.
This is dangerous, Jeremy.
You have to stay out of it, okay? All right.
Just saying.
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Uh Right.
Right.
Hi.
Hey.
- You ready for today? - No.
I hate fighting with you, even if it's fake.
I know, but if Katherine thinks that we're fighting she'll think she's winning.
That keeps her from following through on her threats.
Yeah, but that doesn't make it any easier.
Neither does knowing that Caroline will be there reporting everything back to her.
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.
Yes, we have to keep up this ruse for a little while.
But it's the best way to keep Katherine from hurting anybody, from hurting you.
Just promise me that she won't get her way with us.
We can fake a fight, we can pretend that her threats are tearing us apart but none of it's real, okay? Okay, how about this? Today, when we're fighting, if I say, "I can't do this anymore, Elena" what I'll really mean is that I love you.
And when I say, "Fine, Stefan, whatever" really means I love you too.
Deal.
- Mm.
- Mm.
Are you off today? The Historical Society Volunteer Picnic is today.
- You're the one who signed me up.
- Oh, I know.
I just assumed you'd bail.
Nope.
Gonna spend the whole day with my daughter.
You're gonna pretend to be a mother? - I'll bring my gun if it gets rough.
- Hmm.
Come on, give me one day.
I've been buried in work.
I've barely seen you.
Well, be warned.
I'm in a mood.
Goody for me.
What was Elena doing here so late last night? Elena wasn't Yes.
Um, Elena was here.
Uh, she just needed to talk.
Her and Stefan are going through a rough patch.
Is everything okay with you? - I'm fine.
- It's just lately, you've seemed different.
I'm not different.
I'm fine.
Look, I know you think I don't notice these things, but I do.
What's going on with you? You know, there's pretending to be a mother, and then there's reality.
Let's not push our luck, okay? MRS.
LOCKWOOD: This is part of the Historical Society's continuing efforts to give back to the community.
Thanks to the generous donation of the Fell family we are now standing on the site of our newest public park.
Thank you to everyone who has shown up today to lend a helping hand.
Thanks.
Stefan, right? The other Salvatore.
- The nice one.
- Hmm.
- The one offering an apology.
- Not interested.
- Look, my brother acted impulsively.
- You think? You and Damon keep at each other's throats somebody innocent is gonna get hurt.
I don't want that.
You have family here, so I can't imagine you'd want that either.
So, what do you say we just, uh, quit the whole alpha-male fighting thing and just call it a truce? I made that same offer to your brother.
- He turned it down, with a knife.
- He made a mistake.
And I'm here to make sure that neither one of you make another one.
Tell your brother to watch his back.
I'm guessing that he only has to worry about that during a full moon.
Otherwise, you're not as strong.
Am I right? Or you would have killed Damon by now.
There's one of you, there's two of us.
I think you're the one that needs to watch his back.
- Lf he comes at me - He won't.
- What are you doing? - Negotiating peace on your behalf.
- But I don't want peace.
- Well, consider it Opposite Day.
Stefan, please tell me you don't seriously think a handshake just solved our problem.
No, actually, I think that the first chance Mason Lockwood gets he's gonna drive a stake through your heart, and then through mine.
All because you took it upon yourself to try to kill him.
So thank you, because we don't have enough problems.
Sometimes you might find You feel a little like You're on the wrong side of life Where there's no light But it's gonna turn around sometime - When did Jeremy Gilbert get so cute? - Oh, no.
Stay away, that guy's damaged goods.
Close to the bone But still too far away - Hey, man, how've you been? - Since when? I haven't seen you much since your father's funeral.
- I just figured that maybe you'd want - I'm fine, Gilbert.
Yeah, okay.
Wait, hold up.
I'm sorry.
Bad day.
Bad month.
Listen, you were cool that day, at the wake.
Thanks for that.
Felt like kind of a freak show.
Yeah, well, I know the feeling well.
- What are you doing here? - Distracting myself.
Hey, thanks for the text.
- Where to? - My place.
My mom's gone all day, empty house, fully stocked bar.
- Margaritas? - Sure.
You in? - Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm in.
- Let's do it.
Oh, thanks, Mason.
- Hey, sheriff, you got a second? - I'm out of uniform.
- Let's go with Liz.
- All right, Liz.
I was hoping to talk to you about the Council.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know you and the other founding families have a secret council.
Then you'd know it's a secret and isn't discussed with non-Council members.
I know I rejected all that, but it's because I wanted a life outside of this town.
Not because I was a non-believer.
Look, I know vampires exist.
And you have two of them living right under your nose.
- Really? - Yeah.
And who would they be? Damon and Stefan Salvatore.
That's impossible.
I know Damon.
Do you know what he's done for this town? - I know it's a lot to digest.
- No, no, no.
I have watched him kill vampires.
- He's an ally, he's part of the Council.
- Think about it.
When did the vampire attacks begin? When Damon and Stefan moved to town? - They walk in the sun, Mason.
- They've evolved.
It's not 1864.
They've figured it out, Liz.
No.
Damon Salvatore is my friend.
What if I can prove it to you? So suddenly, she's in the running for Mother of the Year just when I'm trying to avoid her the most.
I'm babbling.
You don't wanna hear all this.
Oh, um, no, sorry.
Then what happened? Well, I was a bitch, which is par for the course with us.
So how are things with you and Stefan? Anything? No, not since the fight.
He's been pushing me away because he thinks that Katherine might get jealous enough to hurt me.
I just don't know how to change his mind.
You said that Katherine's dangerous, and maybe he's got a point.
Yeah, I know that she's dangerous and I know that he's just trying to protect me, but it feels like giving up.
And I just Just what? I just thought that we were stronger than that.
Hey, I saw you with Mason earlier.
What was that about? Oh, I, uh I just asked him to help with the cleanup in the woods.
That's what I'm here for.
Put me to work.
- Should I go help him? - Oh, no, no.
You know what? L He's I'm sure he's fine.
You okay, Liz? You seem really upset.
It's Caroline.
We had a moment.
Is there anything I can do? No, Damon.
Thank you.
It's just my horrible parenting skills paying off in spades.
Uh-oh.
Longing looks are being exchanged.
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, Elena, I think it's a bad idea.
- What's her problem? - Don't worry about it.
Why are you being such a bitch to your mom? Don't worry about it.
Do you still care about Katherine? Don't do this.
Don't turn this into something that it's not.
So this isn't up for discussion.
That's what you're saying? No, I'm saying that this isn't up for discussion right now because we have ears on us.
- Okay.
When? - I don't know.
I saw her, Stefan.
It's like we're the same person.
How could you hate her and be in love with me? You're reaching.
I'm not I'm not Damon.
How about we don't bring Damon into this right now? You know what? I can't.
I can't do this anymore, Elena.
Fine, Stefan.
Whatever.
Relationships are about communication.
Hey.
Where's mine? Have at it.
Thanks for having us over.
I think Sarah's got a thing for Jeremy.
Well, good for Sarah.
Um, ha Look, I'm really embarrassed about slutting it up with you that day at the swimming hole.
- I'm really not like that, I promise.
- No need to apologize.
- Friends? - Yeah, sure.
Can I see? Uh, no, no, no way.
- I wanna see.
- Yeah, let's see.
What's Van Gogh got going on? Okay, yeah.
Uh, check it out.
Ooh, scary demon-wolf thing, ha, ha.
What's this about? Just some sketches.
You still draw, Tyler? A little, but not much.
I've got something that I'm actually working on.
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Yeah, okay, sure.
- It's nothing special.
- You need a drink.
It's pretty much amateur hour here.
Uh, no, I've seen your stuff before.
It's great.
It's on the desk.
Uh I don't really see it any What are those pictures about, huh? I can't breathe.
Answer me.
Why? Why wolf pictures? Because Because I know.
You know what? You know what, Jeremy? I know what you are.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hello, Mason.
- Working hard? - Doing my part.
- I heard you talked to Stefan.
- Nice guy.
- Yeah, a lot nicer than me.
- Well, nice is overrated.
That's what I think.
Ha.
You have a good day, Damon.
Please tell me that you were just bonding.
So, what's up with this, um, faux drama in your relationship? - What are you talking about? - Oh, come on, Stefan.
You and Elena don't fight.
Especially not over me.
Drop it, Damon.
With pleasure.
- Would you like some lemonade? - Thank you, sweetie.
What's wrong with you? DAMON Vervain.
Vervain.
You okay? Nope.
Maybe it's for the best.
It's not for the best, Caroline.
None of this is for the best.
I'm sorry, okay? I I don't mean to take it out on you.
You're just being a good friend.
No, I'm not.
I'm not being a good friend at all.
Is she leaving? Where is my mom going? Look, I can't talk here.
Just get Jess and meet me down the hill at the entrance, and bring a - Yes, we need it.
- What's wrong? - Oh, nothing, I, uh I just have something - You mean work? You surprised me.
You lasted longer than five minutes.
- It's important.
- It always is.
I'm sorry.
- What's going on? - I don't know.
Something's up.
Oh, it burns.
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No.
- No more Mr.
Nice Guy.
- Sit, sit, sit.
I'm not listening to more of your "give peace a chance" crap.
- He's dead.
- Okay.
Okay.
I don't like it, but he's making threats.
He could expose us.
We need to put him down.
All right.
Let's do it.
The woods.
Trash duty.
Come on.
Where are you going? What's going on? I need to be able to hear better.
Hear what? Something's wrong, Elena.
- Caroline - Shh.
Shh.
Don't look so surprised.
You knew this was inevitable.
Go ahead.
Run.
I'll give you a head start.
- Oh, God.
- What is it? - It's Stefan and Damon.
- What? Thank you, Mason.
How do you know about all this? My Uncle John left this old diary lying around.
It was written by a crazy Gilbert ancestor who wrote about this curse that ran in your family.
- Curse about what? - Werewolves.
It's crazy, right? But then Matt was attacked by a wolf under a full moon and your uncle had just gotten back.
It was just It was too weird.
Is it true? About my uncle? Yeah.
- But you, you're not? - A wolf? I'm sorry, werewolf? No.
I mean, not yet.
You know, hell, just saying that out loud, I sound insane.
No, I don't think so.
But then again, I always did believe in the crazy stuff.
According to my uncle, you have to trigger the curse.
Somebody has to die at your hands, like murder or an accident.
I basically have to cause death, and then, boom.
Next full moon, I'm howling on all fours.
Was that why he came back? - To tell you all this? - Yeah, right.
He had to tell me.
I caught him.
He's not here for me.
He's here for this.
It's down the stairs to the left.
Careful.
Bullets and vervain won't keep them down for long.
- What is this place? - Old slave quarters.
From the original Lockwood house.
Thank you, Mason.
I appreciate all you've done.
We got it from here.
- Hey, you're gonna kill them, right? - Yes.
That's why you should go.
I'm here as the Council, not the law.
You can't be a party to this.
It's for your own protection.
- Liz, I don't care about - Yes, but I do, and I'm not asking.
Goodbye, Mason.
Don't take any chances.
- What is it? - They've been here.
What? What are you two doing out here? Have you seen Stefan? Yeah, Elena, I've seen him.
Seen Damon too.
- Well, where are they? - You don't need me for that.
I'll let your friend here sniff them out.
Does your mother know what you are? I'm happy to tell her.
Don't be stupid.
Necks snap easy around here.
I can take you.
- Wanna bet? - Yeah, I do.
Told you.
Come on.
This is how it's gonna work.
Answer me and you don't get shot, understand? How many of you are there? Liz, please.
How did you fool us? How do you walk in the sun? I will drag this out painfully.
But you're my friend.
Our friendship was a lie.
Answer me and I'll kill you fast.
What is that? He's not gonna tell us anything.
Kill them both.
Caroline.
Caroline, what is it? My mom.
She's killing them.
What? - No, Elena, no.
- We have to stop her.
No, I can't.
Elena, she's gonna find out about me.
Elena.
Let's do this.
Each with a stake in the heart, then burn them both.
Check it out.
Elena, what are you doing? You can't kill them.
I'm not gonna let you.
- What was that? - Who else is with you? What the? Hi, Mom.
- You need to drink some deputy blood.
- Oh, no.
I'll be fine.
It's just gonna take a little bit longer.
Unh! Damon's right, you know? If there was ever a time to break your diet He said he didn't want it, okay? This is a most unfortunate situation.
Two deputies dead.
And you.
What am I gonna do with you? You won't tell anyone, will you? Mom? Mom? Please.
Look, I know that we don't get along and that you hate me but I'm your daughter and you'll do this for me, right? Mom, please, he will kill you.
Then kill me.
- No.
- I can't take this.
Kill me, now.
But you were gonna drag it out so painfully.
- No, no, no.
- Damon, don't.
- Damon, please.
- Relax, guys, no one's killing anybody.
You're my friend.
We gotta clean this up.
What is it? It's a moonstone.
I looked it up online.
It's a natural rock but they're supposed to have all sorts of supernatural legends - attached to them.
- Well, why didn't you give it to him? Because he wants it.
I'm a dick that way.
It's important to him for some reason, but I don't trust the guy.
So I'm not just gonna hand it to him.
- Found you.
- You guys are missing all the drinking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you two having a moment? No, we're good.
- Hey, hey, what is that? - It's - Whoa, hey.
- Pretty.
Mm-hm.
- Let's not play with the rock.
- Well, come and get it.
Look, I'll play along for a little bit, but seriously, give it back.
Lookie here.
You snooze, you lose.
You're lucky you're cute when drunk.
I want Jeremy to come get it.
- Give me a break.
- Sarah, don't be a bad drunk.
Jeremy, come upstairs with me.
See how bad a drunk I can be.
Uh, I'm good, thanks.
- Come on.
Seriously, just give it - Ah! Oh! - This isn't funny.
- Ha, ha.
- Easy there, just let me - Hey, that hurts.
- Let go.
- Hey, that hurts.
- Sarah! - Oh, my God.
Sarah.
Sarah.
- She fell.
- She's not moving.
Oh, my God.
- Fooled you.
- Oh, my God.
You pushed me down the stairs.
Look, he didn't mean it, okay? - Okay.
You got her? - Yeah.
Hey.
Sorry that took forever.
I just didn't know how long my mom was gonna be here.
Damon says it'll take three days tops for the vervain to leave her system.
Maybe even sooner.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Get some bunny in you? Yeah, feeling much better, thank you.
A stomach bug.
Yeah, it came on fast.
I'll definitely be out tomorrow.
Tsk.
Tsk.
Tsk.
Or longer.
I'll text you.
Yeah, good night.
Thank you.
It's not exactly the Ritz, but it's secure.
Brought you a good thread count.
Once the vervain has worked its way out, I will compel you you will forget everything, and you will be a free woman.
Keep Caroline away from me, please.
- I don't wanna see her.
- She's your daughter, Liz.
Not anymore.
My daughter's gone.
You have no idea how wrong you are about that.
Stefan, I think that we should What are you doing? Katherine took a little vervain every day and built up a tolerance to it.
I could do the same with blood.
I could learn to control myself on it.
But you can't, Stefan.
You don't have to.
I almost died tonight, Elena.
- Because I was too weak.
- The last time you drank human blood Look, I told you I'd find a way to stop Katherine.
Well, this is it.
This is the only way, because she's stronger than me.
And unless that changes, I can't protect you.
Can we talk later? He can hear us wherever we are because he drinks this.
This is the only thing that can help me.
Are you serious? Or are you pretending to fight? - Because I can't tell if - No, this is real.
No more pretend.
Can I take you home? I can't go home.
Why not? Because I'm scared.
Why are you scared? Caroline, you can talk to me.
Katherine's gonna be there.
And she's gonna want me to tell her everything that happened today.
She told me I had to spy on you and report back to her.
I know.
And I have been so mad at you.
But then I tried to put myself in your position so that I could understand why you would do this to me and to Stefan, because he's been such a friend to you.
Who did she threaten? Matt.
She threatened Matt.
And I'm so scared of her, Elena.
- I am so scared of her.
- And you should be.
Caroline, we all should be.
Why is she doing this? What does she want? That's the million-dollar question.
Hey, sheriff, it's Mason Lockwood.
I just wanna make sure everything went okay today.
I didn't see you later and Give me a call, will you? Hey.
I almost killed a girl today.
- What? - It was an accident.
I was being stupid.
She's okay though.
But there I was, you know, just for a moment for a split second, I hoped she'd die.
Look, whatever this is inside me, I don't want any part of it.
I don't ever wanna feel that way again.
I won't.
I can't.
I know.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Caroline's sleeping on the couch.
I heard.
And you? I'm going home.
What you did for Caroline's mom that's the Damon who was my friend.
Hey.
Stefan didn't drink the people blood, if you were curious.
But he needs to.
And deep down, you know that.
You can come in.
Do you really think that you can control it? I don't know.
But if I don't try So a little bit every day? Yeah, just a few drops of blood in my system.
I think it's worth trying.
So do I.
But I don't want you to do it alone.
What are you doing? It's you and me, Stefan.
Always.
I've been waiting.
Mason? - What happened? - Jimmy attacked me.
What? Why? - He said that I hit on Marla.
- Why would he think that? He's dead.
I killed him.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Ah What was that stunt today that you pulled with Damon and Stefan Salvatore? - Thought you'd be happy about that.
- I told you to stay away from them.
Why do you even care? I don't want you to get distracted.
I need you to find the moonstone.
You got it.
I got it.
