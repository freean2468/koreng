Previously on The Vampire Diaries: Vampires and werewolves roam freely till a shaman curse to limit their power.
Werewolves can only turn on a full moon, vampires are weakened by sun.
Werewolf part of the curse, it's sealed with a moonstone.
He told me about your ex.
Katherine? - You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike? The moonstone is what breaks the curse.
Sacrifices.
Blood of the doppelganger.
- You're the doppelganger.
- Elijah.
- One of the Originals.
- Klaus is the real deal.
The oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me? - What's happening? - Why are you helping me? I was alone when I turned.
I don't want that to happen.
I don't want to be saved.
Not if it means Klaus is gonna kill every person I love.
- Rose Marie.
- I don't wanna run.
I don't have anywhere to run to.
She was scared.
She didn't mean to run.
Yes, she did.
She's been running for 500 years.
- No! - I'll find a way to get you out.
- No matter what happens, protect her.
- Promise.
That right there was the biggest mistake you've ever made.
Come on.
Come on.
MASON It's Mason.
Leave a message.
Mason, it's Tyler again.
Look, your cell's voicemail is full.
I need to talk to you.
It's a full moon tomorrow and, ah, I found your recording, and I'm freaking out over here.
So just call me back.
Please.
MASON Help! Now you've got this back, what are you gonna do with it? Right now, it's what's binding the Sun and Moon Curse.
If I can figure out a way to remove the spell from the stone - the stone becomes useless.
- According to Katherine - Klaus becomes vengeful.
- Maybe.
If he finds out.
Bonnie, can't this wait? Stefan is in the tomb with Katherine.
We've gotta get him out.
- Wants me to focus on this.
- Don't listen.
He thinks he's protecting me, but he's wrong.
I'm taking Stefan's side.
We're not gonna let you get used in some creepy sacrifice ritual.
- What are you guys arguing about? - Not arguing about anything.
I need a coffee.
- What? - Why are you on some suicide mission? I'm trying to prevent everyone else from getting hurt.
Heh, so bringing Klaus the moonstone so you could get yourself killed is okay? Where are you going? - Um, to see Stefan.
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
- Really? - Tell your face.
- Are you serious? She took the moonstone.
- How did you? - We tested you.
You failed.
Klaus killed Katherine's entire family just because she crossed him.
I can't let that happen.
- What did you do? - It's for the best, Elena.
- You trapped her in the house? - It's for the best.
Trust me.
Elena's on a martyr tear that rivals your greatest hits.
Be glad the witch and I are getting along.
I brought you this.
Care package.
Candles, lanterns.
And lunch.
Give that to me, I'm just gonna have to share it with her.
- Yeah.
- You two are calm considering Klaus will hunt you down and kill you if you mess up his plan.
I've been dead before.
Got over it.
Once we deal with this moonstone, we'll figure a way to get you out.
Ah, don't worry about me.
Just make sure Elena's safe.
- Heading out? - Yeah.
Lunch at the Grill, I've got practice then we'll probably go out after.
I'll be late.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry, rude.
You have no idea who I am.
Uh, I'm Jules.
A friend of Mason's from Florida? - You must be Tyler.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.
So I know it's weird of me to just stop by I'm trying to track down Mason.
Mason's back in Florida.
He has been for a while now.
See, uh, that's the thing.
He's not.
So now I'm playing historical society hostess to some writer who's doing this book on Virginia.
- Well, that sounds - Lame.
Carol Lockwood played the dead husband card was too busy to deal.
Plus, my sister kept most of the archives, so there you have it.
Mm.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What's wrong? This girl Mason knows stopped by the house.
She said he never made it back to Florida.
My mom's freaking out, and she was on the phone with your mom when I left.
Uh - We should get going.
- Yeah.
You should really lock your door.
Oh, come on, pouty.
Least give me two points for ingenuity.
- Do you think this is funny? - Yes, Elena.
I find hilarity in the lengths that I have to go to to repeatedly save your life.
- What did Stefan say about this? - Had a good laugh.
And what did he say about Elijah still being alive? Yeah, that.
- I didn't tell him.
- Why not? Well, A, he can't do anything about it, and B what I just said.
Uh, where's Bonnie? - Thought she was meeting you.
- She's on moonstone duty.
And I'm on Elena patrol.
Who's on Tyler Lockwood and the full moon? Vampire Barbie asked if she could handle it.
I said, "Why not?" If she screwed up, he'd bite her.
- Then I'll be rid of two of my problems.
- Hold on a second.
Tonight's full moon? You're too absorbed with all your suicidal tendencies to notice.
- What? - Sheriff Forbes has officially declared - Mason Lockwood a missing person.
- What? Why? Girl from Florida showed up on Lockwood's doorstep looking for Mason.
- What girl? - I don't know.
- She sure got everyone in a tizzy.
- That's not good.
- Where are you? - I'm at the Grill.
I'm on my way.
Change of plans.
You babysit.
Hey, you know, you should get out, enjoy the sun.
Oh, wait.
You can't.
Well, maybe he just, like, stopped to go surf somewhere.
You know, isn't that Mason's whole thing? Maybe.
- Girl seemed to think he would've called.
- I'm sure he's okay.
Yeah.
Anyway Let's do this.
Uh, so you'll call me as soon as you hear anything? Of course.
- I didn't get to say goodbye to your son.
- He's at the Grill with friends.
I'll let him know.
Jules, let's hope for the best.
Hey, I'm here.
No one knows where Mason is.
He's missing.
You were right.
Mason was lying.
There's another werewolf.
His nephew.
Hey, excuse me.
Uh, crazy question.
Do you know Tyler Lockwood? - Hmm.
Mason's mystery woman.
- Yeah.
Where is Mason anyway? - Decomposing in his truck.
- Let him know.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- You think she's a werewolf? - I hope not, being it's a full moon, Ric.
- We should definitely find out.
- And what is that? Wolfsbane.
Tell me you brought the manual.
- Tell me you brought the wolfsbane.
- Yes.
Um, not an easy herb to find.
This is it.
I got water bottles in my bag.
We can mix it in there.
Okay.
Guy at the hardware store said this setup was rated up to 5000 pounds.
Is that more than a werewolf can pull? I have no idea.
Hey, Tyler how you doing? Still human.
Oh, my God.
You're not gonna get naked, are you? It's elastic.
What should I wear? I don't think it's like the Hulk where I get to keep my pants.
Hi.
I don't know what makes me upset.
That I showed you how to channel - or that you almost killed me.
- Luka, I am so sorry.
I wouldn't have done what I did unless it was really important.
- It's just that there's things that l - I forgive you.
Wow, so much stuff.
What is that? - Is this a Grimoire? - They're all Grimoires, heh.
How did you get all these? Witches all over the world have collected their spells in Grimoires but over the centuries, most of them have gotten lost and my dad is obsessed with finding them making sure our heritage stays intact.
These can't all be your family's.
Well, all witches are family.
We're all bonded together by a code of loyalty, to help each other.
- That's why you've been so nice to me.
- That's one reason.
Listen do you know how to break the bind between a talisman and spell? Uh, well, that depends.
Because spells are unique and very specific.
But, uh, I'm sure that we can figure it out.
Well, hello.
Can I have a Scotch and whatever this beautiful woman is drinking? - Oh, no, one's my limit.
- Oh, come on, it's not like I'm a freak.
Just being friendly to somebody who's new.
Okay, if you insist.
- How do you know I'm new? - I've never seen you here before.
And I am here every night, heh.
Excuse me.
Is this guy bothering you? I am not bothering anybody.
Perfect.
Well, do it elsewhere.
Don't worry.
He's harmless.
He's sort of a The town drunk.
And when we get tired of him, we just put him in a cab - and send him to wherever he came from.
- Ha, ha.
- Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
- Why are you here? Thank you for the drink.
So we're fasting now? We're so pious.
How long have you actually gone without blood? I know you get desiccation in theory, Stefan, but in reality, it's much worse.
Your heart still beats struggling to pump whatever blood remains.
And when it's gone, your veins rub together like sandpaper.
It's excruciating.
The pleasure I'll get in watching you suffer is greater than any pain I'll feel.
It's stuffy.
And I've been in this dress for days.
Wanna help me get out of it? Come on, Stefan.
Don't be such a grump.
We're here together.
May as well make the best out of it.
You really think Damon's gonna rush to get you out? He's got what he wants.
- Elena.
- Stop.
Hey.
Given what's most certainly going on out there I'd say you're free to do whatever you want in here.
Nobody will ever know.
Stay out of my head.
Maybe I can do eternity in here after all.
Hey, what are you doing? Oh, perfect timing.
Whoa.
Whoa.
What is this stuff? Your mom's files from the historical society.
I got roped in to helping Mrs.
Lockwood.
And by roped, I mean I'm very excited to participate.
Hey.
I'm Elijah.
Elijah's in town doing research on Mystic Falls.
It's a pleasure.
You're welcome to stay here and rummage through this stuff.
Or Elena and I could help you load it.
Yeah, or I can get someone to pick it up tomorrow.
- Heh.
Also a good plan.
- Thank you for inviting me, Jenna.
And, Elena I hope to see you again sometime soon.
- Thanks for your help, Jenna.
- Anytime.
- What is it? - Um Jenna was just asking me to get you to help her with the boxes.
Oh.
Yeah.
That's a wise choice.
What do you want? I think it's time you and I had a little chat.
There's a B & B down the road and a motel off l-9.
- Lf you ask me, I think it's a mistake.
- No frills is fine.
I'm just here for the night.
It's a long story.
Looking for my friend.
- Oh, who? - Mason Lockwood.
- I know Mason.
- You do? Yeah, he's a great guy.
He's missing.
What do you mean? Like, I mean, "missing" missing? - How do you know Mason? - Friends of friends.
What time is it? It's almost 8.
What time does the moon crest or whatever? Not for a while.
Mason's journal said the first transformation can happen before the moon hits its apex.
Does it say in there how long you'll actually be a wolf? A few hours.
Maybe more, maybe less.
Are you sure? Are you sure you wanna do that? Yeah.
Mason said it will diminish my strength so I can't break free.
Tyler? Oh.
Tyler? Don't! Shh.
Don't! Just don't! Hey.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Oh, forgive the intrusion.
I mean your family no harm.
Why'd you kill those vampires when they tried to take me? I didn't want you to be taken.
Klaus is the most feared and hated.
Those that fear him are desperate for his approval.
Word gets out the doppelganger exists there'll be vampires eager to take you to him, and I can't have that.
Isn't that exactly what you're trying to do? Let's say my goal is not to break the curse.
So, what is your goal? Klaus' obsessions have made him paranoid.
He's a recluse.
- He trusts only those in his circle.
- Like you? Not anymore.
You don't know where he is, do you? So you're trying to use me to draw him out.
To do that, you stay put - stop trying to get yourself killed.
- You're telling the truth? If I wasn't truthful, your family would be dead and I'd be taking you to Klaus right now.
Instead, I'm here to offer you a deal.
What kind of a deal? Do nothing.
Do nothing, live your life stop fighting.
And when the time is right, you and I shall draw Klaus out.
I'll make certain your friends remain unharmed.
And then what? Then I kill him.
- Just like that? - Just like that.
I'm a man of my word, Elena.
I make a deal, I keep a deal.
How are you gonna keep everybody safe? You know, I notice you have a friend, Bonnie, is it? She seems to possess the gift of magic.
I have friends with similar gifts.
You know witches.
And together, we can protect everybody that matters to you.
So do we have a deal? I need you to do one more thing for me.
We're negotiating now? You know, this is good.
Really good.
It's a clear view of the moon.
And, uh, it's private.
If anyone looks up - they're gonna think we're insane.
- Aren't we? So, uh, what's this mysterious talisman we're unbinding? Oh, wow, a white rock.
This is fascinating.
- Doesn't look like much.
- What's it spelled with? Really? Help a girl out, she still keeps secrets.
- Sorry.
- I'm just teasing you.
Ready? No.
Hey.
Tyler? Tyler.
I'm burning up.
It burns! I know.
You just gotta breathe through this, okay? I'll try.
- You should go.
- Mm-mm.
- You should leave.
- Not yet.
Tyler.
Tyler? - Unh! - Tyler? Tyler! It hurts.
It hurts! You know, listen, I'm tight with the sheriff.
If there's anything I can do to help locate Mason.
A great guy.
After his brother's funeral, he stuck around and Helped his nephew and - Tyler? - Mason was with him the whole time.
Helped him through all that grief.
You haven't touched your drink.
Um Not much of a drinker.
I should get going.
Oh, come on.
No, look, one drink.
It will help me sleep.
To sleep.
You fool.
Think you're clever? - What do you want with Mason? - He's my friend.
I'm sorry to inform you that you probably won't find him.
- And why not? - You should leave town.
- Heh.
You threatening me? - Hmm.
On a full moon.
How stupid are you? - Damon, how about that second round? - I think we're done, Ric.
- You think I'm afraid of you? - No, I don't.
That's your vampire arrogance.
You should be.
I sniffed you out the moment you entered along with your pathetic wolfsbane.
See, I've been at this a long time.
And any other night, the situation would be reversed.
But tonight is not the night to pick a fight with me.
You've been marked.
I wanna help, but I don't know what to do.
There's nothing you can do.
Oh, God! Oh, my God.
Tyler.
- Get out.
- No.
Get out.
I don't wanna hurt you.
No.
No.
Okay? Where is she? Just let it go, Damon.
Don't be stupid.
What? I'm supposed to let her just get away? "You've been marked"? What the hell kind of wolf throw-down crap is that anyway? Damon, look up.
Just look up.
If this werewolf stuff is true, one bite and you're dead.
One bite.
All right? Don't risk it.
Just go home, lock your doors, and we'll deal with it in the morning.
Yeah.
It's okay.
You fight through it, okay? You fight.
- Leave.
- No.
Just go.
- Please! - No, not yet.
- Just go.
- I can't.
I'm staying right here.
I am not going anywhere.
Fight.
- Fight.
- Argh! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no! Tyler, don't Just can't stay away, can you? - Well, you don't answer your phone.
- What do you want? - I wanted to apologize.
- Just admit it.
- You don't have anywhere else to go.
- I'm sorry about Elena.
I wasn't thinking straight.
I didn't know she had a death wish.
But I called you.
I tried to make it right, okay? I'm sorry, Damon.
And I have nowhere else to go.
Heh.
There's nothing here for you, Rose.
Well, then.
Damon! - How bad is it? - It hurts.
- It's healing.
- Oh, my God.
I thought a werewolf bite was fatal.
I thought It's not.
You're gonna be okay.
- Ah.
- You were successful? Course, I was.
She fell for the whole show and didn't suspect a thing.
Thank you, Luka.
Yeah.
Whatever.
I'm going to sleep.
Wait.
There's one more thing Elijah needs us to do before we lose the full moon.
Are we seriously not gonna talk at all? No, we can talk about how you regret all you've done to make my life miserable.
What do you want me to say, Stefan? That I'm sorry for everything that I've done? Well, I'm not, okay? It's called self-preservation.
I've been looking out for myself for 500 years.
- Wow.
Look where it's gotten you.
- Yes, I've done terrible things.
I know that.
But I do love you, Stefan.
- Even if you don't believe it.
- Want me to believe you? Show me.
Do something.
Prove to me that there's something inside of you - that's actually worth trusting.
- And then what, huh? - You're still gonna hate me.
- Well, maybe.
And maybe I'll see that there's still hope for you after all.
You're playing me.
Am I? You wanna find Klaus? Kill him so that you can protect your precious Elena? - Let me guess.
You know where he is.
- No, I don't.
- But I could help you find him.
- For a price, I'm sure.
Start with Isobel.
Elena's mother.
She was a research expert.
She found me.
You're welcome.
Elijah.
Good evening, Katerina.
Thank you for having the good sense to be frightened.
Your release has been requested.
- What? By who? - The lovely Elena drives a hard bargain.
However, we've reached a peaceful agreement, she and I.
Please.
Come.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I've had the spell lifted.
As for you, however, you shall not exit until I say so.
When Klaus comes, he'll want to know exactly where you are.
You're free to go.
Elena will explain the arrangement to you.
If she keeps her word, I'll keep mine.
Stefan, no.
Please.
Don't let him leave me in here.
Goodbye, Katherine.
Tyler? - Caroline? - Tyler.
Tyler? Oh, my God.
Okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
You made it.
You didn't get out.
You're okay.
No, I'm not.
Elena.
Hey.
Hi.
Talked to Caroline.
She said Tyler was all locked up.
So it was Jules, the other werewolf, the one who attacked you.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I picked a fight with her.
She was coming after me.
All's well that ends well.
- You all healed? - Yeah.
Seems that way.
Rose, uh I'm happy that the legend was fake.
Maybe werewolves made it up to keep vampires away.
Lucky me.
Hmm.
I'm gonna stay and help you.
- Help me do what? - Save Elena.
Protect Elena, all things Elena.
Really? - Why? - Because I like you.
I believe in friendship.
I happen to have a vacancy in that department and you can use all the friends you can get.
Just friends? Just friends.
Are you're sure you can do that? I don't love men who love other women.
I think more of myself than that.
But it doesn't mean I can't be your special friend.
- I think I like you.
- Ha, ha.
- Ow.
- What?
