Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.
- What are you? - I'm a vampire.
- Why are you here? - I miss my brother.
He told me about your ex, Katherine.
She broke your heart.
That was a long time ago.
Why do I look like her? Our love for Katherine, it wasn't real.
Katherine never compelled me.
It was real for me.
- Are you psychic or clairvoyant? - Technically, I'm a witch.
- That noise.
- What noise? Tyler! What the hell? - We need help here.
- Caroline.
You talked to your mom? - What is it? - It's your dad.
He's dead.
You decided that I was worth saving.
I wanted to thank you for that.
- Anna.
- Here.
It's my blood.
- Die with it in you, you'll come back.
- Anna's dead.
I saw her killed.
- I know you cared about her.
- Yeah, I did.
You scared me.
Sorry.
- Is Jenna home? - She had to meet the fire chief.
She doesn't know the truth.
They've covered it up.
Yeah, I know.
How's Jeremy? Holed up in his room.
I looked everywhere.
STEFAN You think someone stole it? Someone took my stuff.
- Can I help? - Sure.
Want me to pick you up? I gotta check on Jeremy before I go to the hospital.
- Can you meet me there? - You bet.
Okay.
- I love you, Stefan.
- I love you too.
Katherine? Hello, John.
Goodbye, John.
Jeremy? Are you up? WOMAN 911, what's your emergency? Hi, I need an ambulance to 2104 Maple Street.
Behind you.
- What? - Behind you.
Jeremy.
Jeremy! Jeremy.
- Please, Jeremy, wake up.
- Ah! He's okay.
What happened? He said Anna gave him her blood, then he took these pills.
And now I mean, he looks fine, but then again, so do you.
- So l I don't know.
- Come here.
Look at me.
No, I'm fine.
I feel exactly the same.
Should I call a paramedic? What should I do? No.
He's fine.
You mean, I'm not a vampire? Damn it.
Don't say that, Jeremy.
Jeremy, why would you want that? Did you hear about Anna? What happened to her tonight? She's dead.
Jeremy.
Jeremy, come here.
Sit down.
I am very sorry about Anna, but it's very important that you listen to me.
Anna's blood is leaving your system.
If you tried to kill yourself right now, you could really die.
- Hey.
Do you understand me? - Stefan.
Yeah, I understand.
Good.
What about the pills he took? He didn't take enough to die, so Anna's blood actually healed him of that.
- Miss Gilbert? - I'll be right there.
- You need to be at the hospital.
- But No, no.
I'll stay here with Jeremy.
No, I don't need a babysitter.
Yes, you do.
How's Caroline? She's not good, Bon.
What happened? We were driving and Tyler heard this noise and he got - A noise? - He got, like, this migraine or something and he lost control of the car and l I thought that Caroline was fine, and then And then she wasn't, so Liz.
I came as soon as I got the message.
Is she okay? She's in surgery.
It's They're doing everything they can.
- I need your help, Damon.
- Sure.
Anything, Liz.
Mayor Lockwood is dead.
They thought he was a vampire.
They put him in the basement.
- Mayor Lockwood was a vampire? - No, no, no.
A mistake was made.
They said he dropped liked the others when John's device went off, but he He couldn't have been a vampire.
I've known the man my whole life.
Now Carol Lockwood is gonna want answers.
And all I can think about right now is Caroline and I'm It's okay.
Hey.
- God.
- It's okay.
Bonnie, how's Caroline? She's weak.
They don't know if she's gonna make it.
What? Is there something that you can do? A spell or something? She doesn't know how.
Do you? No, I don't.
No, you don't.
Because it took Emily years to learn a spell like that.
Yeah, well, I can take down a vampire.
That spell was easy to learn.
- I can give Caroline some blood.
- No.
No way.
Just enough to heal her.
She'll be safe.
It'll be out of her system.
She'll be better.
- It's too risky.
I can't agree to that.
- Do it.
This is Caroline.
Okay? We can't let her die.
Do it.
If I do this, you and me, call a truce? No.
But you'll do it anyway.
For Elena.
I know this is the last thing you wanna do right now but we should talk about what happened tonight.
One of the tomb vampires got into the house and almost killed John.
What? What? When? What are you talking about? After I left? - You were there? - Come on, Elena, you know I was.
- When were you at the house? - Really? Earlier? On the porch? We were talking, all cathartic, feelings exposed.
Come on, we kissed, Elena.
Okay, I don't have time for this, Damon.
Hey, if you wanna forget it happened, fine.
But I can't.
Elena? I came as soon as I got your message.
- How's John? - Where have you been? At the Fire Department.
I had to fill out a report.
- I told you earlier.
L - No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- No, Jenna, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
Oh.
Mm-mm.
You gotta be kidding me.
Hey.
How's Caroline? Not good.
Just what I needed.
Katherine.
Least I fooled one of you.
Feel better? Stefan? - Elena.
- What happened? Katherine happened.
- Did she say what she wanted? - No.
Woman knows how to make an entrance.
She said she fooled one of us, at least.
What does that mean? She pretended to be Elena too when I showed up earlier tonight.
I told Jeremy.
- I can't lie to him anymore.
- You all right? No, I'm not all right.
I thought that, with all the tomb vampires gone - things would get better.
- I know.
We all did.
Katherine was in this house.
That means that she's been invited in.
What are we gonna do? - Move.
- Very helpful.
Thank you.
Katherine wants you dead, there's zero you can do about it.
You will be dead.
But you're not, so clearly she has other plans.
We need to find out what those other plans are and not provoke her in the process.
What happened tonight when you thought she was Elena? To risk another frown line encroaching on a very crowded forehead we kissed.
- You thought it was me? - What do you mean? Well, you know, when two lips pucker and they go: Don't be obvious.
Stefan, wait, he kissed Katherine, not me.
I wouldn't do that.
We don't have time for this, guys.
Later.
John must know something.
There has to be a reason why Katherine tried to kill him.
She's Katherine.
She loves to play games.
You're fooling yourself if you think you're gonna find what she's up to.
Actually, Elena's right.
John could know something through Isobel.
Your mother was in touch with Katherine.
We can go to the hospital.
- Get him to talk.
- I've got a better idea.
What's that? I'm just gonna ignore the bitch.
See you.
Is that smart? If Katherine thinks she's being ignored, it'll lure her out.
She'll make a move.
Yeah? Then what? Stake her, rip her head off, something poetic.
We'll see.
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.
- You been here all night? - With the sheriff.
No one else? Stefan's brother, Damon, stopped by late last night.
How is Caroline today? See for yourself.
Jersey Shore is on.
Oh, careful, still a little sore.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
But they say I'm healing really quick.
My turn.
Aw.
Isn't he cute? Why are you crying? - Oh, Bon.
- Heh.
- Oh.
- I'm just happy you're okay.
- Oh, I love you guys.
- We love you.
I wanna know exactly who's responsible for killing my husband.
I'm looking into it, but be straight with me.
Is there any reason Richard was affected by the vampire device? What are you implying? That he was one of them? No, no.
No one's implying that.
Your deputies screwed up, plain and simple, which makes you responsible.
Your husband helped John Gilbert execute his idiot plan in the first place.
- Liz - Someone got my husband killed.
We're all on edge here.
You've suffered a great loss.
The whole town has.
But we have to stick together.
Okay? Trust each other.
We'll get through this.
So the black sheep returns.
- Tyler? - Yeah.
What happened to you? In my mind, you're 12 years old.
That's two years older than the last time you saw me, Uncle Mason.
Come here.
- Good to see you, man.
- It's good to see you too.
Come on inside.
Ready for this? John? I'm Elena.
I'm not Katherine.
- We know she did this to you.
- We need to know why.
- Where is she? - You tell us.
I don't know.
You're too weak to play tough guy.
Why don't you just sit back, answer a few questions? Please.
Tell us why she's here.
What does she want? She'll try again.
We can't help you if you don't confide in us.
In you? In your daughter, then.
My daughter should have driven a stake through your heart by now.
I never spoke with Katherine directly.
She never trusted me.
So either kill me or get out.
Because I can't stand the sight of you with my daughter.
You see the world with such hatred.
It's gonna get you killed.
You may be okay with dying, but I have a better plan for you.
You now have my blood in your system.
All I have to do is kill you.
Now take my advice.
Leave town.
Elena doesn't want you here.
You have 24 hours before the blood leaves your system.
That's enough time.
Or so help me God, I will turn you into a vampire and I will watch you hate yourself more than you already do.
The clock starts now.
Who's the guy with Carol? Mayor's brother, Mason Lockwood.
Is he on the Council? Like John Gilbert was when he rolled in? He's nothing like John.
For one, he's not an ass.
He's not a believer either.
He wants nothing to do with the Council.
He's too preoccupied finding the perfect wave.
Hmm.
Thanks.
See you.
Hey, Elena.
Thanks for coming.
Come on in.
I have to swing by home to pick up Jenna and Jeremy so we can go to the Lockwoods'.
How did you leave it in there with John? I, uh I asked him to leave town.
Asked? You threatened him.
- Yeah, I threatened him.
- Good.
I want him gone, Stefan.
I know I shouldn't feel that way, but I don't want someone like that in my life.
- Or Jeremy's life.
- I know.
I know.
So, what now? Now I need to go find Damon.
Please, don't fight with him.
He tried to kiss you.
I'm not okay with that.
That's not the problem.
Katherine is.
She's messing with both of your heads.
And Damon's not stable when it comes to her.
The last thing we need is to make things worse.
Did you know the Gilbert device affected Tyler Lockwood? Well, I know it took the mayor down.
Don't you wanna know why? Yes, Bonnie, I would love to know why a non-vampire was tortured by the vampire torture device that you let John Gilbert use against us.
- Speaking of your guilt, how's Caroline? - She's much better.
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.
- Why am I welcome? - You lived to see another day.
No good deed goes unpunished with you.
Doesn't undo the bad.
I know what you are, Damon.
You might have Elena and the sheriff and everybody else fooled.
- But not me.
- Hmm.
One wrong move and I'm gonna take you out.
Stop with the witches' brew.
You're starting to believe your own press.
Hmm? Oh.
I'm sorry.
You were saying? Oh, my God.
Damon drives me crazy.
He's walking around like he's some kind of hero for healing Caroline when it's his fault all this happened in the first place.
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
What Damon's done is just awful.
Okay.
Better.
Hateful Damon moment over.
- Ha, ha.
- Thanks.
Um, I gotta find Tyler, pay my respects.
- I'll be back.
- Okay.
- ELENA Hello? - Elena? - Where are you? - I know.
I'm late.
I'm getting in the car now.
I'll be there in five.
We haven't officially met.
I'm Katherine.
- I know who you are.
- Of course you do.
You're the best friend, right? I've been putting all the pieces of Elena's life together.
Isobel told me it was a bit of a puzzle.
I do know who Jenna and Jeremy are.
And I've met that delicious ex-boyfriend, Matt, who's sweet on Caroline and then there's you, the vampire-hating Bennett witch.
Did I do good? I've been around a long time, Bonnie.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
Nice.
Katherine.
- Stefan.
- Leave her alone.
Okay.
What are you doing here? After the way you treated me I thought that a public place would be less violent.
Taking this a little far, don't you think? Elena could walk in at any moment.
Mm, but that's part of the fun, Stefan.
Damon's here.
Somewhere.
Been avoiding him.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Matt.
I, uh, heard that Caroline's doing much better.
Her recovery was miraculous.
Must be relieved.
I am.
Thanks, Elena.
- Ahh, his eyes are so blue.
- You need to leave now.
You're hurting my feelings, Stefan.
Damon was much happier to see me.
Then again, he thought I was your girlfriend.
Katherine, I'm not doing this with you.
Okay.
How about we don't have a couple's fight in front of all your friends? - Walk with me? - Just tell me what you're doing here.
Maybe I missed you.
- Is that an acceptable reason? - What game are you playing? - Wanna play with me? - I don't know.
How can I play if I don't know the rules? No rules, Stefan.
Don't you remember? No rules.
Looks like the whole town has turned out.
Yeah, well, he is He was the mayor.
- Why don't they save it for the funeral? - It's what people do.
The Lockwoods were here for us when we went through this.
It'll be quick.
We'll drop off the food, pay our respects, go.
In and out? Sounds like a plan.
You guys go ahead.
I'II, uh, be right there, okay? Hey.
How are you doing? Great, Elena.
Walking on sunshine, thanks for asking.
- Damon - Elena.
We should be able to talk about this.
Damon, we're close enough now.
I really wanna know how you're doing.
I kissed you.
Thought you kissed me back.
Doppelganger high jinks ensued.
- How you think I'm doing? - I think that you're hurt.
Mm, no.
I don't get hurt, Elena.
No, you don't admit that you get hurt.
You get angry and cover it up and then you do something stupid.
You're scared.
You think Katherine's gonna send me off the deep end, don't you? I don't need her for that.
You know, why? Why is it such a surprise that I would kiss you? That's not a surprise.
I'm surprised that you thought I'd kiss you back.
Now I'm hurt.
- Elena.
- Bonnie, what happened? - Hey.
Sorry.
I was just looking for the - The bathroom's down the hall.
She says don't let go Hey, look, I'm sorry about your dad.
Today's been a big day of sorries from people who really don't give a crap.
I remember when my dad died I had a house full of strangers telling me what a great guy he was.
Anyway, I know how hard all this is.
Difference is, in your case, it was true.
My dad was a dick.
Yeah.
Yeah, he was.
But the world's got him down on his knees So she throws him at the wall I found this in his desk.
He won't mind.
He's dead.
Yeah, you know what? Sure.
Why not? - Hey, what's going on in here? - Nothing.
Nothing.
You got somewhere else to be? Never give up It's such a wonderful life Wonderful life Wonderful life Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful life Don't let go Never give up It's such a wonderful life The Lockwoods have a lot more land than they used to.
Possessions of all the tomb vampires built them quite a fortune.
Yeah, why did you want them dead? Hmm? - You're the one who turned most of them.
- Heh.
There's nothing more annoying than a vengeful vampire.
Just ask John Gilbert.
- You haven't changed at all, have you? - But you have.
You're stronger.
Meaner.
Sexy.
Don't flirt with me, Katherine.
I'm not Damon.
I haven't spent 145 years obsessed with you.
Yeah, based on your choice of women, I'd say otherwise.
Though it does bother me that you've fallen in love with someone else.
Oh, I was never in love with you, Katherine.
You compelled me.
So none of my feelings were real.
Believe what you want, Stefan.
But I know the truth.
And deep down, so do you.
- The truth? - Mm-hm.
Well, the truth is you're the same lying, selfish manipulative bitch that you've always been.
So whatever it is that brought you here why don't you just get on with it and leave town? Because if you don't, I will hunt you down and I will rip your heart out.
You wanna know why I'm here, Stefan? I came back for you.
Well, the problem, Katherine is that I hate you.
You hate me, huh? That sounds like the beginning of a love story, not the end of one.
You gonna be okay? Yeah, it'll heal.
That's not what I meant.
I was trying to figure her out.
I was playing along.
I let her get to me.
Tried to track her, but she's gone.
Ew, cover up, Fabio.
We got a crazy ex on the loose.
Better watch out.
Looks like Katherine's trying to steal your guy.
- That's not what's happening.
- Isn't it? I mean, it's only fair, since I went after your girl.
I'm gonna go check on Jenna and Jeremy.
Let me know when you guys are done.
So, what's it gonna be, huh? Fight to the death? - Heh.
- Go ahead.
Make your threats.
Stake your claim.
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- Why? I'd fight me.
Katherine will play us against each other.
You know that? Brother, don't you worry.
Our bond is unbreakable.
We need to stay united against her.
So, yes, as much as I would like to kill you, I'm not gonna fight you.
I kissed Elena.
Because you feel something for her.
Because you actually care.
I won't let Katherine come in and destroy that part of you that is finally, after all of this time, willing to feel something.
She'll try to break you.
She'll try to break us.
And how we respond to that will define us.
It's our choice.
So, no, I'm not gonna fight you.
Jeremy.
What are you doing here? I'm packing.
Leaving.
So you figured you'd kill all your evil vampires and then you'd leave town? Not all, but enough.
For now.
- Can you tell Elena I said goodbye? - Why don't you tell her yourself? You know, Jeremy, I was taught to hate them.
The vampires.
It's what I know.
It's what your father knew.
My father would've seen things differently.
No.
He may have done things differently, but there's no other way to see it.
That ring, the one that's supposed to protect you, that was my father's, right? Yeah.
Then why didn't it protect him? Why is he still dead? What happened to your parents wasn't supernatural.
It was an accident.
There's nothing that can save us from that.
I wonder what he'd think of all this.
Of me.
He'd think that you're still young, still finding yourself.
But you are a Gilbert.
You've been exposed to this town's secret and with that comes responsibility.
I don't believe in that family legacy stuff.
Sooner or later, you'll have to.
- Tyler, what are you doing? - I hate him.
- Oh, don't say that, honey.
Don't ever - Let go of me.
- Get off me.
- Hey.
Tyler.
Hey.
Hey.
- I said, get off me.
Get the hell off me.
- Tyler.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Calm down.
Settle down.
Oh, God.
Very brave of you to come here.
I wanted to say goodbye.
Leaving so soon? I know where I'm not wanted.
Don't pout.
It's not attractive in a woman your age.
Ouch.
What, no goodbye kiss? Why don't I kill you instead? What are you doing here? Nostalgia.
Curiosity.
Et cetera.
I'm better at the enigmatic one-liners, Katherine.
- What are you up to? - Trust me, Damon.
When I'm up to something, you'll know it.
Come on.
Kiss me.
Or kill me.
Which will it be, Damon? We both know that you're only capable of one.
My sweet, innocent Damon.
That's more like it.
Okay, wait.
Wait.
Brief pause.
I have a question.
Answer it and it's back to fireworks and rockets' red glare.
Answer it right and I'll forget the last 145 years I've spent missing you.
I'll forget how much I loved you.
I'll forget everything and we can start over.
This can be our defining moment.
Because, I mean, we have the time.
That's the beauty of eternity.
I just need the truth.
Just once.
Stop.
I already know your question.
And its answer.
The truth is I've never loved you.
It was always Stefan.
Oh, God.
You scared me.
Just doing my part in the neighborhood watch.
Thanks for, um Iooking out for us.
For me.
That's me.
Your trusty bodyguard.
Calm in crisis.
You been drinking? And you're upset.
That's not a good combination.
No, I'm not upset.
Upset is an emotion specific to those who care.
Come on, Damon.
That's a lie.
You care.
You're surprised that I thought you would kiss me back? You can't imagine I'd believe you'd want to? - Damon - That what we've been doing here means something? You're the liar, Elena.
There is something going on between the two of us and you know it and you're lying to me, and you're lying to Stefan and most of all, you're lying to yourself.
I can prove it.
No.
No Damon, don't.
- What's wrong with you? - Lie about this.
Stop it.
You're better than this.
Come on.
- That's where you're wrong.
- No.
Damon, I care about you.
Listen to me.
I care about you.
I do, but I love Stefan.
It's always gonna be Stefan.
Elena, what's going on in here? Nothing, Jeremy.
It's okay, just go back to bed.
No, it's not okay, Elena.
He wants to be a vampire.
No.
Damon, stop it.
Wanna shut off the pain? It's the easiest thing.
The part of you that cares goes away.
All you have to do is flip the switch and snap.
Damon.
No! Your mom's out.
Think she popped a couple pharmaceuticals.
I didn't mean to freak her out.
I don't know why I get like this.
It's the curse of being a Lockwood.
So how'd you get the chill gene? I didn't.
I've just learned how to manage it.
I don't wanna be like this anymore.
None of us do.
That's why it's a curse, Tyler.
He saw the ring.
That's why he did it.
He knew.
He didn't see the ring.
It's Katherine.
She got under his skin.
She undid everything that was good about him.
There's nothing good about him, Stefan, not anymore.
He's decided what he wants.
He doesn't wanna feel.
He wants to be hated.
It's just easier that way.
He got his wish.
- I hate him, Stefan.
- I know.
I know.
Is he okay? Is he okay? He's okay.
You're okay.
Shh.
You're okay.
He's okay.
He killed me.
Damon killed me.
Shh.
It's okay.
Oh, God.
Ah! Elena? Hi, Caroline.
What are you doing here? My name is Katherine.
I was hoping you could give the Salvatore brothers a message for me.
What are you talking about? What message? Game on.
What?
