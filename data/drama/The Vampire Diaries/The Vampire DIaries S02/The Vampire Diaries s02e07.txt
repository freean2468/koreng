Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
- What are you? - I'm a vampire.
He told me about your ex.
Katherine? I don't want you seeing Elena anymore.
If you don't remove her from your life, I will kill everyone that she loves.
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike? The Lockwoods are werewolves.
The werewolf gene runs in the Lockwood family.
- What triggers the curse? - You kill somebody! The werewolf part of the curse is sealed with a moonstone.
Katherine will only rip your heart out.
Let me do it for her.
You have no idea what you've done.
- Did I put a kink in your master plan? - Do you honestly believe - that I don't have a Plan B? - Jenna, no! We were stupid, sneaking around, thinking we weren't gonna get caught.
- But it's over.
- I'm going to go after Tyler Lockwood.
- And you're not going to stop - Until he kills me.
Here.
I'm still shaking.
What happened? Go ahead, tell him.
You're gonna love this.
- I saw Katherine today.
- Where? At the Grill.
I just stopped by to just gawk and quasi-stalk Matt.
- Do you need a table? - No.
L I'm not staying.
I just needed to use the little girls' room.
Skip the teen drama.
Get to it.
Then I had to pretend to use the bathroom even though I didn't really have to go, because I'm a doofus.
- Elena.
- Hey.
I saw you with Matt.
Are you okay? Yeah.
Yeah.
Whatever.
You're good.
What gave me away? Was it the hair, or was it my clothes? I know Elena's at I know Elena's at home.
I need you to deliver a message.
What was the message? Tell Damon and Stefan that I want the moonstone or I will rip this town apart until it rains blood.
Tell him the rest of it.
Tonight, at the masquerade ball.
She wants to do it public.
- Killing Mason threw her off guard.
- She's running scared.
- What she did to Jenna was desperate.
- We can't underestimate her.
- We have to play this smarter than her.
- Can't we give her the stone? No.
Katherine's not getting dick.
I've had it.
I'm gonna go to the ball, and I'm gonna kill her.
- You're not gonna kill her.
- Don't give me that.
- You're not gonna kill her.
- Oh, really? Because I am.
Easy.
- Okay.
- Grab the door, Jer.
- Okay, stop fussing.
I'm fine.
- The doctor said to take it easy.
You don't wanna rip your stitches, hemorrhage and die.
The only thing I'm gonna die from is embarrassment.
- No.
- I walked into a knife.
How does somebody do that? - It was a freak accident.
- Yeah.
It happens.
Yeah, I mean, I've done it like 20 times at the Grill.
Okay, I'm being nice.
- Hey, careful.
- All right.
Easy.
- What should I do with this? - I got it.
- So, what are we gonna do? - Make lunch.
About Katherine.
- We're not gonna do anything, Jeremy.
- She tried to kill Jenna.
- We can't let her get away with that.
- Yes.
If it keeps us safe, then we can.
What if she tries something else? She won't.
Katherine hurt Jenna because I didn't do what she said.
Well, I'm doing it now.
Me and Stefan are over.
She wins.
The end.
You're being naive, and you know it.
- Where are you going? - Out.
I'll be back.
Where should I put these? Right there.
Thank you, Miss Flowers.
You've been such a wonderful help.
It's my pleasure, dear.
Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
I will.
- Whoa, Kat, chill.
- Do not sneak up on a vampire.
Don't attack a witch.
It's good to see you, girl.
- I'm glad you made it.
- You called, I came.
- Like you had a choice.
- Now, don't get all boss-lady on me.
You know I love you.
Hmm.
- Now, where does one wear this? - To a masquerade ball.
Tonight.
You wanna be my date? - Hey.
Come on in.
- I got Stefan's message.
Hey.
You brought the Grimoire.
Thank you.
What's going on? We're gonna kill Katherine.
- I can explain.
- Please.
We're gonna kill Katherine.
Now, this works with compressed air.
Trigger mechanism here.
I've got two of these in a different size.
Now, for you, I recommend this.
Fits nicely under a jacket sleeve.
Here's the trigger.
And when you're ready: You wanted me to show you how to kill a vampire, so What's with the hair? I'm impersonating my dull-as-dishwater doppelganger, Elena.
- She has the worst taste.
- Except in men.
Isn't it a risk pretending to be her in front of the entire town? I've gotten quite good at it, actually, and everyone's gonna be in masks.
Mm-mm.
It's for some feed-the-something charity.
It's for a good cause, Lucy.
Ha, ha.
Okay.
Well, have you actually seen the moonstone before? - I thought it was some made-up legend.
- I have seen it.
I need you to help me get it back.
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do with it? You want me to break the curse.
Let's just get it first.
What I really need is for backup.
I can't imagine that Damon and Stefan are just gonna hand it over without putting up a fight.
I know you love Elena, and you wanna be with her, but it's risky.
Too many people can get hurt.
Look, I want Elena back, yes, but it's more than that.
I mean, what Katherine did to Jenna, it crossed a line.
She has to be stopped.
- I don't know, Stefan.
- Look, Katherine knows me.
She knows I'm not gonna try something in a crowd full of innocent people.
So that gives me an edge.
I can catch her by surprise.
I could do a spell to trap her.
Like the tomb spell.
Right.
We can isolate her away from the others.
Please, Bonnie.
Okay.
You're welcome to hang out.
Alaric's coming.
It's gonna be pizza and bad TV.
Uh, I'd love to, but I'm going to the masquerade party at Lockwood's.
Aren't you? Uh, no, not with what's going on with me and Stefan.
I've gotta go.
There's something I gotta do.
What? Just something.
I can't talk about it.
But I've gotta go.
- Okay.
Well, have fun.
- Yeah.
Me in a suit.
You look good in a suit.
You and Stefan will work it out.
I don't think so, Matt.
There's so much about me and Stefan that'll never work.
You know I'm here for you always.
Are you sure you don't want me there? No.
Stay with Elena.
I don't want her to know about this.
Okay.
Well, I'll make sure she doesn't leave my sight.
All right.
If anybody wants to back out, I'll understand.
Cold feet, speak now.
I don't want this going wrong because someone chickens out.
Caroline? I won't.
Look, she killed me.
Fair's fair.
As long as there are no werewolves running around.
Oh, I took care of Mason.
As long as Tyler doesn't kill anyone, he won't turn.
Bonnie? You with us? - But no one gets hurt.
- Except Katherine.
Tonight, Katherine gets a stake through her heart.
And making it our way There's emptiness behind their eyes There's dust in all their hearts It's already packed out there.
You know, we need to keep that door shut.
Your father would be very unhappy if I let guests in here.
Oh, look at you.
So handsome.
Thanks.
You look pretty good too, Mom.
Oh, a compliment.
I think I'll fall over.
Listen I'm sorry I've been a dick lately.
A jerk lately.
It's just - Have you heard from Mason? - No, and I don't think we're going to.
He's coming, he's going.
It's just his way.
He's the exact opposite of your father.
We should've canceled this party.
This whole masquerade theme was his idea.
I don't know what it has to do with helping the homeless but once he made up his mind, he could really be a dick.
A jerk.
But I loved him.
And I know you did too.
It's natural to feel abandoned.
I just don't want you to feel alone.
Come on, put your mask on.
Let's just go out there and pretend to have some fun.
I think I need a cocktail first.
- Elena.
- Matt? - You look dashing.
- I thought you said you weren't coming.
I couldn't miss it.
You really are hot in a suit.
I would love to just Okay, here's the deal.
Do you know what you have to do? I'm going to get Tyler Lockwood really drunk.
I'm going to start a fight with him, and I'm gonna beat him until he snaps.
- And then? - I won't stop until he kills me.
God, you're hot.
- Now go away.
- Thank you.
- You see her? - Nope.
- Sure you can do this? - Pfft.
Who are you talking to? I had the chance to kill her, and I hesitated.
Well, that is the fork in the road between you and me, my friend.
I don't hesitate.
I mean, you spent 145 years loving her.
It could happen.
I won't hesitate.
Okay.
We're really not supposed to be in here.
Yeah, I know, but we really need to turn this party up.
Just looking out - Another shot? - Hey, I want a shot.
- Me too.
And then we have to dance.
- Yes.
You know, usually, it's me corrupting you.
I like this.
Okay.
Let's go party.
Come on.
'Cause you are my medicine When you're close to me - Thought this room could work.
- It's perfect.
Is that the spell book I read about in my family's journal? It's my ancestor Emily's.
The spell I'm doing is similar to the one that sealed the vampires into the tomb.
- Can you do all the stuff that's in there? - I mean, it takes practice.
I've worked on some small spells, spells that only do good.
I don't wanna know too much.
I don't particularly enjoy any of this, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah, but you're 100 percent witch.
That is so cool.
It's anything but cool.
Did your family journals tell you what happened to Emily? Or what about my grams? Never ends well for people like me.
If you feel that way, why help? Because I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
And I don't know how to stay out of it.
- I feel like an invalid.
- That's because you are an invalid.
- Where's Jeremy? Isn't he hungry? - He already left for the Lockwood party.
- He went to that? - Yeah.
I'm glad.
He needs to have more fun.
Lose some of that emo thing.
I'm gonna get some napkins.
- What's going on? - What do you mean? I haven't heard from anyone all day.
It's like everyone's avoiding me.
And now Jeremy's supposedly at the party? - He hates stuff like that.
- I don't know what to tell you, Elena.
So then you'll be okay if I head out and meet up with everyone.
Wait.
Wait.
What are you hiding, Ric? Stefan asked me to keep an eye on you just in case Katherine showed up while he was at the party.
So Stefan's at the party too? He would never go to the party for himself.
He did that stuff for me.
Just let this one go, okay, Elena? We need to let Stefan and Damon know the room's ready.
- Do you feel that? - What's the matter? Are you cold? No.
Uh, excuse me.
Do I know you? No.
I'm a plus-one.
I know no one.
But it's a great party, though.
- Are you okay? - I just got a weird vibe.
Let's find Damon.
I wanted to be with you alone And talk about the weather But traditions I can trace Against the child in your face Dance with me.
Escape my attention No.
Fine.
Then tell me who I should kill.
Him? Mm.
She looks delicious.
I'm lost in admiration Could I need you this much? Oh, you're wasting my time You're just, just, just wasting time Something happens And I'm head over heels - Ha, ha.
It's a beautiful night.
- Ha, ha.
Why the charade? How's Jenna? I certainly didn't expect her to survive that.
Lucky girl.
Clumsy.
How does one stab oneself? - Katherine.
- Mm? - I don't want anyone to get hurt tonight.
- Okay.
Then give me the moonstone, and nobody will.
Mm.
Well, see, I don't have the moonstone on me.
So you and I will have to go get it together.
Mm.
I have a better plan.
You go fetch it, and I will try not to kill anyone in the meantime.
My way, or you don't get it.
Hey, Stefan, I can't find Matt.
Oh, my God.
Elena, you look so pretty.
- I love that dress.
You look gorge.
- Thank you.
I love your necklace.
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, it's twisted.
Here.
Let me.
Here we go.
Paralyzed from the waist down.
And dead.
The moonstone, Stefan.
Ticktock.
Hey, guys, I'm gonna, um, go to bed.
You good over there? Night.
Night.
Under the stars - I put the body in the trunk for now.
- We'll dump her when we get back.
This is exactly what I didn't want, Damon.
- Stefan, it's collateral damage.
- Right.
- Which is why we need to call it off.
- What? Who's hesitating now? Hey.
Don't do this to me.
This woman ruined our lives.
She destroyed us.
Tonight it ends.
We can do it together.
I got your back.
- All right? - All right.
So can you do, like, a hocus-pocus to ace a test? - I don't know that spell.
- It'd be, like, the first one I'd learn.
Or maybe, like, a sex spell or something.
I don't know.
You wanna dance or something while we're waiting? No.
I mean, no, thank you.
You didn't tell me there was another witch here.
- Didn't I? - No, you didn't.
No one is supposed to know I'm involved.
- This changes things, Katherine.
- This changes nothing.
You're here because you owe your dear friend a favor.
You wouldn't wanna lose my friendship, now, would you? Elena.
Hey.
Sorry.
Could l? Could I talk to my sister? - What is it, Jeremy? - I have a message from Stefan.
Oh? He and Damon want you to meet them by the woods.
- They brought the moonstone.
- And why are you their little messenger? Because they know I'm not afraid of you.
Mm.
You Gilbert men, so courageous.
How's John, by the way? Were they able to sew his fingers back on? What the hell is going on? Will you be there if I call? - Sorry.
- It's all right.
Let's go.
Will you still walk away? I'll understand If you're afraid But people change People change I'm not gonna let you down this time What are Stefan and Damon up to? What do you mean? I've got Jeremy Gilbert luring me out to the lake.
What's going on? I don't know.
L Nothing.
Don't lie to me, Caroline.
They're up to something.
What is it? L Wait, wait, wait.
No.
Okay.
They're trying to kill you.
Figured as much.
Where's the moonstone? - Bonnie has it.
- And where is Bonnie right now? I don't know.
Okay.
She's upstairs.
She's upstairs.
- You guys are trying to kill her here? - We saw an opportunity.
- We had to take it.
- Stop with the "we.
" Are you crazy? - You're gonna get yourselves killed.
- We know what we're doing.
How am I supposed to feel if you guys get hurt because of me? It's not just you.
She's messed with all of us.
She has to be stopped.
Why do you keep dragging me into this? I don't want any part of it.
Shut up.
Which room is it? It's that one.
Where is she? I did it.
I really didn't think that I'd be able to fool you, but I did it.
What the? Stefan? Hello, Katherine.
Goodbye, Katherine.
You don't really think that you can kill me with that, now, do you? No.
But he can.
- Elena.
Elena.
- What is it? What is it? Hey, what's happening? Hey, what's going on? Jeremy, it's Katherine.
She's linked to Katherine.
Get them to stop.
Now! Stop! You're hurting Elena.
Everything you're doing to her is hurting Elena.
You think you two are the only ones with a witch on your side? Wrong.
And something tells me that my witch is better than your witch.
Jeremy, go check on Elena.
Make sure she's okay.
Go.
Let's all make sure poor Elena's okay.
Just a little bit more pressure, and - Bonnie, it hurts.
- I can't break the spell, Elena.
I'm sorry.
But I can try to take some of the pain away.
Okay? Okay? Okay.
- This is really gonna hurt.
- Wait.
Okay.
So how about that moonstone? - Are you okay? - Are they? They're stuck in there with her.
You were right.
Katherine had a witch link Elena to her.
That girl I saw.
The one inside.
Stay with her.
Keep pressure on her shoulder.
- Where are you going? - There's a witch here.
I'm gonna find her.
- No.
- Take this.
- No.
Jeremy - Elena, listen.
Listen to me.
You need this more than I do.
No, Jeremy.
What I need is for you to be safe.
The three of us together, just like old times.
The brother who loved me too much, and the one that didn't love me enough.
And the evil slut vampire who only loved herself.
What happened to you, Damon? You used to be so sweet and polite.
- Oh, that Damon died a long time ago.
- Good.
He was a bore.
Oh, why don't you two stop antagonizing each other? - Where's the moonstone? - What do you want with it? Does Elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar? That was really desperate, Katherine.
Don't you think that we could see right through you? So it doesn't bother you that Damon's in love with your girlfriend? - Oh, stop it.
- Or what? You'll hurt me? Come on, Stefan.
Everything that I feel, Elena feels.
So go ahead.
Or better yet kiss me, Damon.
She'll feel that too.
You know, this whole Mason thing has me a bit confused.
Why a werewolf? The moonstone can break a curse that would help them destroy all vampires.
So, what's in that for you? Sorry about your pet wolf.
Probably should've kept him on a tighter leash.
I'll have to remember that for next time.
He's not the only wolf in town.
- So, what happened to Aimee? - I don't know.
She disappeared.
She's probably drunk somewhere.
Like me.
Whoa.
Don't do that.
What, man? It's a party.
Right, Dad? You know, looks like your dad wants a drink.
Hey.
That's not cool.
- What's wrong with you? - What? The guy was a dick.
Come on.
You're being mean.
His dad's dead.
- Give me the picture.
- Whoa! Remember how your dad used to slap you around? - Are you kidding? - Just having fun.
Put the picture down, man.
Okay, you need to calm your drunk ass down.
Do something about it.
I'm not gonna fight you.
Get off! What is going on? Stop! - Stop! - I can't.
Let me go.
I have to finish.
- What the hell's wrong with you? - Let me go.
What? Matt? Matt? Matt? - How did you? - Matt failed.
If Matt fails, I can't.
Tyler, look out! No, no, no.
Come on, wake up.
Sarah.
Sarah, open your eyes.
Wake up.
This can't happen.
Oh, no, this can't happen.
This can't be happening.
Sarah.
Sarah, get up.
Sarah.
Open your eyes! Oh, God.
Oh, this can't be happening.
No.
Oh, God.
Tyler? Tyler? - Tyler, what's happening? - Get away.
- Get away! - What's happening? - Damn it.
Where's that witch? - We could play charades.
- You bargained the moonstone.
- What are you mumbling about? When you struck a deal with George Lockwood to fake your death you told me that you gave George something that he needed.
- It was the moonstone, wasn't it? - Good for you, Stefan.
Two plus two.
And it would've worked, except people found out that I wasn't in the tomb.
Thanks to you, by the way.
Have I mentioned how inconvenient your obsession with me has been? You and me both, honey.
But why do you? Why do you need it back? - I love you in a suit.
So dashing.
- What were you doing with it in the first place? - You're wasting your breath, Stefan.
- Unless it wasn't yours to begin with.
In 1864, you faked your death.
Who were you running from, Katherine? In 1987, you were in Chicago, at a concert of all places with that wench Lexi.
Come on, Stefan.
Don't look so surprised.
Of course I checked in on you over the years.
You were standing in the front row, dancing all night.
You were watching Bon Jovi, and I was watching you.
Who were you running from? I love you.
If you should smile And look so surprised While I light a fire in your new shoes Let's hope that your soles Don't burn to the floor - You looking for me? - Who are you? - Lucy.
- What are you doing here? I should've known I'd run into a Bennett.
How do you know me? You figure it out.
Look, I have no interest in fighting you.
Then stop the spell you put on my friend.
Give Katherine the moonstone, and I will.
Why are you helping Katherine? Don't you know what she is? Tell your friends to hand over the moonstone, and all will be groovy.
You're not leaving this room until you stop the spell.
- Look, I don't wanna hurt you.
- I don't wanna hurt you.
Look, I don't have a choice.
The bitch saved my life.
Now I owe her.
I have to pay up.
You have the moonstone.
I can sense it on you.
You feel that? You can trust me.
Give it to me.
It's okay.
We're missing the party.
I'll have one of those.
Right away, Miss Katherine.
Thank you.
- No.
No.
No.
Damon, don't.
- Yes, Damon, please.
The second the spell's lifted, I'm gonna drive this stake right through your heart.
God, you're hot.
When did you get so hot? Katherine.
The spell in this room has been broken.
You're free to leave.
Thank God.
When I hand this over, my debt to you is over.
- Done.
- I owe you nothing.
- I said done.
Give it.
- I wouldn't do that.
You should've told me another witch was involved.
She's a Bennett witch, Katherine.
But I'm sure you knew that.
- Wait.
Elena - Elena's fine.
The spell is broken.
She'll heal quickly.
Bonnie's with her.
I apologize for my involvement.
Matt and I were fighting.
We broke up, you know.
And Sarah was drunk, and dancing, and she just tripped.
- Then she wasn't breathing.
- Okay, your mom's on her way.
And we called Sarah's parents.
It was an accident.
It was a terrible, tragic accident.
Mom.
The sheriff's here.
I'll go prepare her.
Just don't leave.
Just stay here, okay? She's going to wanna hear the story from you.
Matt's in the car, sleeping it off.
I'll deal with him.
I don't want him involved in any of this.
What are you doing? I'm fixing a very bad situation.
Why? I did this.
I killed her.
No.
You didn't mean to.
- And I think it's best for everyone - But she's dead.
You don't know what that means.
Actually, Tyler, I think I do.
No, you don't, Caroline.
Has your wound healed? How did you? Please, wait.
Hey, I'm sorry about that spell.
Damn vampires.
They pull you into the middle of it every time.
How do I know you? When I gave you the stone, how did I know I could trust you? That feeling you got you ever felt it before? I mean, around family.
My grams.
My mother is Johanna, first cousin twice removed from Pauline niece of Sheila, a.
k.
A Grams? We're related? Yeah, we kind of are.
It's nice to meet you, Bonnie.
Seeing you tonight was a wake-up call for me.
Gotta stop letting vampires control me.
So thank you for that.
Please, don't leave.
I have so many questions.
I don't wanna be in the middle either.
I hate it.
How do I stay out of it? Unlike me, you're one of the good ones, Bonnie.
The middle of it is exactly where you need to be.
You take care, cos.
Don't worry, you'll see me again.
Hey, I was gonna head home.
Can I offer you a ride? Are you okay? When did you get your driver's license? I'm not a kid anymore, Bonnie.
I'd love a ride home.
Elena.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Bonnie took away the pain, and I think I'm healing.
I know, but I think you should definitely see a doctor anyway.
I will.
I heard about Katherine.
Is it true? Is she really gone? Yeah.
- I was so worried about you.
- Stefan.
I Katherine being gone doesn't change anything for you, does it? I wanna be with you, Stefan.
You know that.
But first, I need to wake up and know that the people that I love are safe.
I need to feel safe.
Do you understand? Yeah.
Yeah.
I understand.
Hello, Katherine.
- Where am I? - Where you should've been all along.
I thought you would've learned your lesson, messing with a Bennett witch.
- You should've killed me.
- Death would've been too kind.
No.
Damon, don't.
Damon, don't.
You need me.
Elena's in danger.
From who? You're lying.
You're always lying.
Why do you think I haven't killed her? Because she's the doppelganger.
She needs to be protected.
- Then I'll protect her.
- No.
- While you rot in hell.
- No.
Damon, don't.
I'll do anything.
Please, Damon.
You need me.
Damon.
You need me! You need me! Yeah, Jeremy, I've got my car.
Tell Bonnie that, whatever she did, I'm starting to feel better.
Yeah, you can drive her home.
I'm just gonna go straight to bed.
Okay.
