Previously on The Vampire Diaries: - You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike? You're a Petrova doppelganger.
The key to the curse.
Klaus is a vampire born from a werewolf bloodline.
The curse kept his werewolf from manifesting.
He'll be vulnerable during the transformation, when Bonnie comes in.
If she can deliver him to the brink of death, I'll finish the job.
I had a family.
Klaus hunted them down one by one.
He scattered them where their bodies could not be found.
I didn't bury them at sea.
Their bodies are safe.
If you kill me, you'll never find them.
No! Who's gonna save your life while you're making decisions? - I don't want to be saved.
- There is a way.
What are you? Damon, no.
I fed her my blood.
She'll come back a vampire.
How could you? She'll never forgive you.
- Tyler Lockwood bit me.
- A werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
That'll get easier.
But you know that.
What do you want? I wanna apologize.
- Damon - Please.
Elena, feeding you my blood, I was wrong.
Yes, you were.
And I know I don't deserve your forgiveness but I need it.
And I need some time maybe a lot of time.
Sure.
Of course.
Take all the time you need.
Get off of me.
You're not doing this.
Just did.
You know what happened to Rose, Stefan.
I don't care.
You're not dying today.
What's the plan, Superman? - I'm gonna find a way out of this.
- Oh, right.
A miracle cure.
Good luck with that one.
I got Bonnie looking for something, anything.
Always the hero, Stefan.
Just tell me goodbye, get it over with.
Lie still.
Conserve your strength.
You've been busy.
That was amazing.
How long has it been? Almost two days.
Full moon came and went.
You remained a wolf.
I can change at will then.
That's good to know.
I remember every single kill.
Yes, I've been cleaning up your mess.
Just like old times, brother.
Well, you've had your fun.
I believe we have a bargain.
That's right.
Now, what was it again? Oh, yeah, wait.
I remember.
That's it.
You wish to be reunited with our family.
You gave me your word, Niklaus.
What kind of brother would break his bond? Even though you did try to kill me.
I could have.
But I didn't.
Now no one can, not even you.
Relax, Elijah.
All is forgiven.
Where are they? You need to lighten up.
I'll bring you to them soon enough.
You've reached somebody who's currently not operating.
I need your help.
You have me confused with somebody else.
I'm not allowed to help just idly sit by while my girlfriend gets sacrificed on an altar of blood.
Damon's dying.
- What? - Tyler Lockwood bit him.
We don't have much time.
What do you need? You brought me to see a girl movie.
We had to get out of the house, Jer.
This is our three-hour distraction from reality.
Is that what we're doing? Pretending our lives aren't screwed? We need to do this, okay? Breathe, eat, sleep, wake up and do it all over again until one day, it's just not as hard anymore.
Hey.
There you guys are.
- Who's hungry? - Are we really doing this? Yes, we are really doing this.
Yeah, we're going to take a page from Scarlett.
We made it through the war.
I know you guys went through hell, and my mom knows I am a vampire so basically, it's like Atlanta has burned.
And yet, in spite of everything, we persevere.
All right.
What are we eating? Something good.
I'm not sure this is gonna work.
You've done a s√©ance before, right? Contacted Emily Bennett.
Maybe one of the witches know how to help Damon.
Let's just hope they want to.
Bonnie? Bonnie? Emily.
Why have you come here, Stefan? I need your help.
I need to know if there's a spell that can heal a werewolf bite.
No.
Nature ensures a balance to everything.
Is that true? Or are you just saying no because it's Damon? Perhaps it is his time to die.
No.
That's not balance that's punishment.
I will not give you what you want.
So you're saying that there's an answer to give? Please.
If you know something, just tell me.
Help me save my brother.
Bonnie.
They don't want us here.
They think I'm abusing their power.
They know something.
There's an answer.
- They just don't wanna tell me.
- Yeah.
I heard them say a name.
What was it? Klaus.
Carol, hi.
How you feeling? Better, thank goodness.
It was a terrible fall.
Shouldn't you be resting? I've been resting.
Now I'm ready to work.
Update me on where we are with the vampire situation.
Well, there's been some developments, but I'm handling it.
Are you? I left you in charge of this town's safety and I'm not seeing any results.
I said, I'm handling it.
Then see that you do, sheriff because if you can't, I'll find someone who will.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Look who couldn't resist an epic romance.
Will you come take a walk with me? You're breaking the rules, you know.
Movie night's supposed to be a distraction.
Tomorrow we can return to our regularly-scheduled drama.
I know, I wish this could wait, but it can't.
Listen, um the other night when Damon was helping Tyler, something happened.
Tyler was starting to transform and Damon was bitten.
What? Is it? Is he gonna? Yeah.
Oh, my God.
He came to the house this morning and tried to apologize.
I practically slammed the door in his face.
He told me not to tell you, but I figured if you wanted to talk to him I wouldn't wait.
- Stefan - It's not over.
There might be a cure.
- But I have to find Klaus to get it.
- No, he's gonna kill you.
No, he had the chance to kill me, but he didn't.
Whatever Damon's done, whatever's led him here I'm the one that made him become a vampire in the first place.
So if there's a chance for a cure, I owe it to him to find it.
Go talk to him.
Just tell him that there's still hope.
Mr.
Salvatore, spying on a lady is a sign of very poor manners.
My apologies, Miss Katherine.
But since you are here my corset strings seem to be knotted.
I wonder if you can undo them.
Of course.
Will you miss me while off defending the South? - I shall.
- Then I hope you will hurry back.
I fear I will be Ionely with you away.
I would think Stefan should be company enough.
Is it so wrong for me to want you both? Damon.
- Elena? - Don't you see? She was toying with you.
All you had to do was say no, walk away.
You had a choice.
Promise me that you will return quickly.
I promise.
- Hello, Katherine.
- Two days, I've been waiting.
I'm supposed to be free of Klaus' compulsion by now.
- He's supposed to be dead.
- We ran into complications.
- Complications? - Doesn't really matter.
I just need to find him.
Do you have any idea where he might be? Klaus, you're back.
Look who decided to come for a visit.
You just keep popping up, don't you? I need your help.
For my brother.
Whatever it is, is gonna have to wait.
You see, I have an obligation to my brother that requires my immediate attention.
You understand how important family is or you wouldn't be here.
My brother gave me his word that he would reunite me with my own.
And so I shall.
Shh.
Now, what am I gonna do with you? Do you feel that? It's scraping against your heart.
The slightest little movement and you're dead.
He's just trying to help his brother.
The witches said you had a cure.
Make me a deal.
Just give me the cure and I'll do whatever you want.
Trouble is I don't know if you'd be any good to me the way you are now.
You're just shy of useless.
- Well, that looks bad.
- It feels worse.
My subconscious is haunting me, Ric.
Please tell me you have something for that.
Heh.
Double shot.
That's good.
Oh, good.
So my brother sent you for suicide watch? He's just trying to help.
He's doing what he always does trying to right the wrongs of the past.
Ugh.
You should want me dead.
I'm the reason Jenna got killed.
- I don't blame you for Jenna.
- Oh, sure you do.
Let's not forget I turned your wife into a vampire.
- You must really hate me for that one.
- Okay, give me your glass.
Neither one of us is drunk enough for this conversation.
Kill me.
Please.
Screw you.
No.
Elena? Elena's not here, Damon.
Don't make a sound.
I need blood.
I need blood.
Where's Damon? Now's not a good time, sheriff.
Trust me.
- Sheriff, over here.
- I wouldn't go in there.
- I just wanna talk to him.
- I wouldn't go in there.
Liz.
All this waiting around for news is ruining Scarlett for me.
- Alaric, hey.
- Tell me you're with Elena.
She went to see Damon, I thought that's where you were.
He escaped.
He's looking for her.
The cops are after him.
He's in bad shape.
If you find her get her somewhere safe, okay? I'm on my way.
If Damon is off the rails, there is nothing you can do to stop him.
- Let us take care of it.
- You keep doing this.
You left me behind before and Jenna still died.
Now, I'm going to find my sister.
You go ahead and try to stop me.
I heard about this one vampire, crazy bloke always on and off the wagon for decades.
When he was off, he was magnificent.
and wiped out an entire migrant village.
A true ripper.
Sound familiar? I haven't been that way in a very long time.
Well, that's the vampire I can make a deal with.
That is the kind of talent that I can use when I leave this town.
Katerina, come here.
No.
No.
No.
No, no.
You want your cure? There it is.
Your blood is the cure.
Gotta love Mother Nature.
Now let's talk, you and I.
Katherine? Damon.
Where's Elena? I need to see Elena now.
Hey, let's get you out of here first, all right? Hey.
Where's Damon? What have you done to him? Why do you even care? You know what they are, what they do.
I understand why you hate them, but you're wrong.
They're murderers, Elena.
End of story.
Damon Salvatore was spotted outside entering the Grill.
Wait.
You gotta let me come with you.
He's sick.
He's He's not himself.
Keep her here.
Hey, it's me.
I'm with Damon at the Grill.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
I've got a gunshot victim at the Grill.
Get paramedics.
You're gonna be fine.
- Jeremy.
- It's gonna be okay.
What did you do? I was aiming for Damon.
- He still has his ring.
- She's human.
The ring won't work.
- Caroline - I got it.
Come on, Jeremy.
Just drink.
Jeremy, drink.
- What are you doing? - Helping him.
- Jeremy, drink.
- Please.
Please.
Bonnie, what's going on? Oh, my God.
I know what I need to do.
I need you to grab him.
- Take him with us.
- No, no, no, you can't move him.
- This is a crime scene.
- Mom, let them go.
Okay.
All right.
Come here, buddy.
I got you.
I got you.
There it is.
You wanna save your brother? How about a decade-Iong bender? You know I have big plans for you when we leave this town.
I'm not like that anymore.
Well, that's too bad.
You would have made a hell of a wingman.
Wait.
Now, that's more like it.
I want you to join me for a drink.
Finish it.
All of it.
You do everything I say and I save your brother.
That's the deal.
Again.
Is this even possible? There's a spell for it if they'll give me the power to use it.
- No.
- What? What is it? They're angry at me for coming back here.
They don't wanna help.
- Well, they have to.
- They said there will be consequences.
Well, he's just a kid.
Tell them to shut up.
Emily.
Emily.
I know you're there.
Please help me.
I love him.
No.
- Oh, my God.
- Bonnie? Oh, my God, Jeremy.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.
What happened? Doesn't matter.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Thank you.
- MAN 1 - Much for the Yankees to take.
MAN 2: We'll have to make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition.
Elena.
Damon.
Come on.
We have to get you out of here.
We have to hide you.
- Where are we going? - Everywhere.
Wait for me.
I wanna come with you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Relax.
- We need to get you out of here.
- You're faster than I thought.
- Why must you always run? Because I know you will chase.
Then let me chase you forever.
Will you feed me your blood? I will not feed you, Damon.
If you want it, take it.
It is your choice to make.
I choose you, Katherine.
Look at me.
Hey.
It's Elena.
It's Elena.
- Promise me you will not tell my brother.
- I promise.
It will be our little secret.
No.
Damon.
No.
I have to, if we are to be together forever.
Damon, stop.
You're hurting me.
Damon, you don't have to do this.
Please stop.
You're hurting me.
Elena.
Damon.
Damon.
That was Bonnie.
Jeremy's alive.
I thought I killed him.
You did.
I don't understand.
I explained it to you once.
But I had to make you forget because I was so scared of what you might do.
But now I don't wanna lie.
I'm not gonna be afraid of you anymore.
And I don't want you to be afraid of me anymore.
I'm still your little girl.
It's me.
It's me.
Mom? Hey.
What are you doing? Trying to figure out what's wrong with me.
I feel different, weird.
You were dead.
It would be weird if you felt normal.
Bonnie, I I don't know how to thank you.
You can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
And the day after that.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Good night, Jeremy.
- Good night.
Hey, bud.
I was gonna take off.
You need anything? Uh No, no.
I think I'm good.
You know, uh on second thought, I might crash here.
That cool? Yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.
All right.
Alaric, um Thank you for everything.
Oh, you can thank me tomorrow.
And the day after that.
- And the day after that.
- Dude, I knew you were listening.
- And the day after that.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Elena.
It's okay, Damon.
I'm right here.
Elena, get out of here.
I could hurt you.
No.
You won't.
I'm here until the very end.
I'm not leaving you.
Get out of here.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.
It's not okay.
All those years, I've blamed Stefan.
No one forced me to love her.
It was my own choice.
Shh.
- I made the wrong choice.
- Hey.
You tell Stefan I'm sorry.
Okay? I will.
You're very cooperative.
It's almost as if you're enjoying it.
No more.
Not until you give me the cure.
Not until we make a deal.
It's your choice, Stefan.
You can either remain here living your life in Mystic Falls or you can embrace what you truly are.
Leave town with me and save your brother's life.
That's the spirit.
Sweetheart take this over to Damon and come right back.
- You want me to leave? - No.
Yes.
And if I were you I'd hurry.
She'll never take it to him.
She'll never take it to him.
This is even more pitiful than I thought.
There's still hope.
I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here.
I deserve this.
I deserve to die.
No.
- You don't.
- I do, Elena.
It's okay.
Because if I'd have chosen differently, I wouldn't have met you.
I'm so sorry.
I've done so many things to hurt you.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
I know you love Stefan.
And it will always be Stefan.
But I love you.
You should know that.
I do.
You should have met me in 1864.
You would have liked me.
I like you now.
Just the way you are.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, it's me you should be thanking.
I mean, I'm the one who brought the cure.
- I thought you were dead.
- I was.
You got free.
Yep.
Finally.
And you still came here? I owed you one.
Where's Stefan? - Are you sure you care? - Where is he? He's paying for this.
He gave himself over to Klaus.
- I wouldn't expect him anytime soon.
- What do you mean "gave himself over"? He just sacrificed everything to save his brother, including you.
It's a good thing you have Damon to keep you company.
Goodbye, Elena.
Oh It's okay to love them both.
I did.
I suppose, brother you've been reunited with our family.
Put him with the others.
We're leaving town tonight.
So did Katerina make it in time? - You won't be seeing her again.
- Because she's on vervain? I've been around a long time, Stefan.
I rarely get played for a fool.
Besides, she won't get far.
You'll help me see to that.
What is it you really want from me? All will be explained in time.
Once we leave this tragic little town.
Then are we done here? - Can we go? - Not quite.
You see, I have a gift for you.
Come here, sweetheart.
Don't be afraid.
See, I wanna make sure you honor our deal that you'll be of use to me.
I could have compelled her to behave, but a real ripper enjoys the hunt.
Now we can go.
Alaric? Alaric.
Jer.
Anna? Vicki?
