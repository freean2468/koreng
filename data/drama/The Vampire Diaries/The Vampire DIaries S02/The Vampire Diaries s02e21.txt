Previously on The Vampire Diaries: - You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike? You're a doppelganger, the key to breaking the curse.
Klaus is a vampire of werewolf bloodline.
The curse has kept his werewolf from manifesting.
But if he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.
Klaus wanted to deliver a message.
Sacrifice happens tonight.
The ritual is straightforward.
A witch will channel the power of the full moon to release the spell bound within the stone.
After that, Klaus, being both werewolf and vampire - will sacrifice one of each.
- Where do I fit? Klaus must drink the blood of the doppelganger to your death.
- I can't lose you.
- You won't.
- There is another way.
- Damon, no.
You'll come back a vampire.
How could you take that choice? She'll never forgive you.
A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
Don't be his friend.
Tyler? Without the werewolf, he can't perform the ritual.
First rule, always have backup.
Backup werewolf.
Backup vampire.
She's in transition.
- Why didn't he use me? - He couldn't.
- What is this, Damon? - A werewolf bite.
- Caroline, let me help.
- Get back, I got it.
Caroline, the door's not gonna hold.
- The bars! - Tyler, please.
Matt.
No.
Hey, no.
It's Tyler.
- He's trying to kill us.
- Wait.
He's wounded.
- Stay back.
- You can go around him.
Are you nuts? You're not gonna shoot him again, okay? Okay.
- Matt, take my hand.
- I got it.
Matt, take my hand.
- That's what a werewolf bite looks like.
- Yep.
It's not that bad.
Will be.
So that's it? You're just gonna die? Well, that depends.
You know anything about a cure? Me either.
A hundred and 45 years and no last goodbye? You don't get a goodbye.
Don't Don't leave mad.
Us ending up on good terms is not exactly on my bucket list, Katherine.
Klaus made me call Jenna to lure her out.
I didn't have a choice.
That's why I gave you the vervain.
So you had a choice.
It was her or me.
I chose her.
I helped you.
You owed me.
When Klaus dies, you're gonna walk out without a scratch and Elena's aunt dies.
Somehow you're the only one that wins.
How'd that happen? I didn't let love get in the way.
Enjoy an eternity alone, Katherine.
What are you gonna do? I'm gonna offer myself as a replacement to Klaus.
He won't take you.
He saw your bite, he said that your blood is impure.
I'm sorry, Damon.
But Jenna's dead.
There's nothing you can do about it.
Oh, my head.
What's wrong with me? - Do you remember what happened? - You called me.
You were so scared.
I should have realized that it wasn't you.
The second I walked out of the house, someone grabbed me.
A vampire.
Klaus.
It was Klaus.
He made me drink his blood.
And I don't remember anything after that.
Where are we? What happened? We're at the quarry.
He brought us here.
Why don't I remember anything? Jenna, do you remember when I told you how someone becomes a vampire? Yeah, if you die with vampire blood in your system, it's Oh, God.
He killed me.
Jenna, listen.
Everything's going to be okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm a vampire? And I bet you're hungry.
Don't bother trying to get through.
I spelled the circle.
You're trapped, no matter what you do.
Greta, please just let her go.
- Klaus chose her.
- No.
Drink it.
- Jenna, don't.
- I can't.
Let her go.
Hey.
No.
No.
Jenna.
It's gonna be okay.
Hey.
Jenna, hey, look at me.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Hey.
This is useless.
In all these Grimoires, there has to be something to keep Elena from becoming a vampire.
And we'll keep looking.
Until the last minute.
The sacrifice is completed in stages as the full moon sets.
The werewolf is killed, then the vampire, finally the doppelganger.
Once Elena dies, the curse will be broken.
- Klaus will become hybrid.
- So when do we attack? Elena's death will activate his dormant werewolf side.
He'll be vulnerable during the transformation.
Bonnie comes in.
You're sure Bonnie will survive this? If she can deliver him to the brink of death, I'll finish the job myself.
- Damon.
- Not gonna like what I'm about to say.
Cut to the chase.
Is the sacrifice happening or not? It's happening.
I tried to stop it, but it got complicated.
We're sticking with the plan.
We're meeting Bonnie.
- He's got Jenna, Stefan.
- What? He got Katherine to lure her out of the house.
What is it? What's wrong? He's going to use her as the vampire in the ritual.
Oh, my God.
- How are you feeling? - I feel like myself.
Only not.
Everything is brighter.
The fire's hotter.
Part of me is terrified but there's another part of me that doesn't wanna feel anything.
Vampires can turn off the part that's human.
That's the part that hurts.
- I'm gonna die, aren't I? - No.
Jenna, I'm not gonna let that happen.
I don't care what I have to do.
- Who's that? - That must be the werewolf.
What's happening to me? I cast a spell to slow down your transformation.
Your insides are trying to tear themselves free.
Greta, witches are supposed to maintain the balance in nature.
It's your duty to them to keep this curse sealed.
My duty is to Klaus.
The new order.
Glad to know I still have a dance partner.
Hello, my lovelies.
Are we ready? Come on.
Get in here.
- Do you see anything? - We're not safe here.
If that thing wants in, it's getting in.
How did you even know what I was? I compelled you to forget.
I was on vervain.
I faked forgetting so I could spy on you.
- It was your mom's idea.
- Wait, my mom knows? Oh, my God.
You told her.
- Well, what'd she say? - Your mom hates vampires.
She grew up hating vampires and she'll probably always hate vampires.
- Well, what about you? - What about me? Where does this leave us? Stuck in this house trying not to get mauled to death by our friend.
Heard you.
Wow.
Great.
I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat.
Elena hasn't returned any of my calls for days.
I need to see her.
You're a day late and a daughter short.
- What are you talking about? - Klaus has her.
Sacrifice goes down tonight.
How could you let that happen? You were to keep her safe.
Wasn't that the sum total of your plan, to keep her safe? - She is safe.
I fed her my blood.
- You what? When Klaus kills Elena, she will come back to life.
Granted, as the thing you hate most, but no one really cares what you think.
You do not wanna mess with me right now.
You ruined her life.
You know that, right? I know.
I took her choice, destroyed her future.
Trust me, I get it.
It actually gets worse.
How could it possibly get any worse? I've got the moonstone.
I spent 500 years looking for this.
I hate to part with it.
The moon has passed its apex.
- Remember everything you need to do? - I remember.
Everything I did I was just trying to help Tyler.
Are you Jules? I didn't want him to be alone.
Shall we? - Which one are you reading? - Emily Bennett's.
There's a section on spells she did for Johnathan Gilbert.
Yeah, I think she had a thing for him.
There's something on a resuscitative spell she was working on.
I saw that too.
She just didn't explain what it did, exactly.
Maybe Johnathan wrote about it in his journals.
You know, I can have Stefan bring them.
Someone's here.
Hey, what are you doing here? Elijah and Stefan are upstairs.
You mind if I have a second with Jeremy? Sure, yeah.
Of course.
What's the matter? Jeremy, something's happened to Jenna.
- Why did he take Jenna? - A punishment for meddling.
Klaus was gonna use Tyler and Caroline.
- Damon rescued them.
- Then we need to go.
Now.
Before Jenna's been sacrificed.
I can kill Klaus.
Bonnie, if you use that much power, you'll be dead.
We've already been through this.
It's not an option.
- Neither is letting Jenna die.
- Stefan would agree with you.
We're gonna offer another vampire.
One that he'll want more.
Me.
Does that mean it's working? It's working.
The day the lawyers called to tell me I was your guardian you know what my first thought was? "Isn't there someone else who can do this?" There was no one who could have gotten me and Jeremy through all of that.
Just the thought that I almost passed up taking care of you.
But you didn't.
You put your entire life on hold to help us.
Look around, Elena.
- I failed you.
- No, you didn't.
I failed you.
I'm so sorry.
Listen, being a vampire, it intensifies your guilt.
But it also makes you stronger and faster.
You can fight back.
I'm gonna get through this.
I'll be okay.
I need you to believe that.
But promise me when you get the chance run.
- You don't think I killed him, do you? - No.
No, it takes a lot more than wooden bullets to kill a werewolf.
He's still out there somewhere.
Do you think my mom wants to kill me? I don't think your mom knows what to do with you.
Yeah, well, I don't really know what to do with me either.
- What is it? - Wait.
No.
Don't.
Don't shoot.
What the hell are you doing? - Give me your jacket.
- What? Your jacket, take it off.
Hey.
Hey.
Caroline? Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
Bonnie did the locator spell.
They're at Stevens Quarry.
I'll head over, you'll follow with Bonnie.
Just as the moon hits its final phase.
She's to stay hidden until then.
He cannot know that she's alive.
You're very honorable.
Are you? Because this whole plan is It's contingent upon your honor, Elijah.
I won't fail you.
Klaus is your brother.
I know I've wanted to kill my brother a thousand times.
I've never been able to.
Well, Klaus was not my only brother.
I had siblings.
Parents.
I had a family.
Over the centuries, Klaus hunted them down one by one and he took them from me.
He scattered them across the seas where their bodies could not be found.
You want revenge.
Sometimes there's honor in revenge, Stefan.
I won't fail you.
Please end this.
I brought the Gilbert journals.
I think I know the spell you're talking about.
- Where's Damon? - Upstairs.
Alaric wanted to talk to him.
- He did what? - He wasn't gonna let Jenna die.
We have a witch.
She kills Klaus.
No one has to die.
Except for Bonnie.
God, Stefan, damn it.
Hey, are you okay? I'm fine.
Well, that's my brother for you.
Always cleaning up my messes.
Hello, Jenna.
Let her go.
I understand that I have to die, but she doesn't - Careful.
- Elena, don't.
No, Jenna.
We can't leave Jeremy without a family.
I followed your rules, I did everything that you asked.
I didn't run.
Please? Well, well.
I don't recall you being on the guest list.
I'm here to talk.
Very well, then.
What can I do for you, Mr.
Salvatore? We found something in the journals.
Johnathan journaled the story of a mother who called on Emily.
The woman's baby was sick, dying.
Emily cast a spell that would bind the woman's life force with her child.
Skip to the "save Elena" part.
The child died, but the mother's life force flowed through her restoring her to life.
We already know Elena's gonna come back to life.
She'll be a vampire.
- Not if her soul remains intact.
- Her soul, really? You're gonna put your faith in some "act of God" mumbo jumbo? I refuse to let Elena become the thing I've spent my life protecting her against.
And you can call that God or mystical energy, whatever you want, but, yes.
I'm putting my faith in it.
- What's going on? - I don't know.
You can hear them.
You can hear anything.
Just focus on them.
You don't need to kill Jenna.
I'll take her place.
Oh, I don't know.
I rather appreciate the symmetry of three women three goddesses sacrificed at nature's altar.
What are they saying? I can't make it out.
You can do this.
Just relax.
Focus.
Don't play games with me.
You'll get what you want.
I can hear him.
I hear Stefan.
What are they saying? You're quite the hero, aren't you? - Yeah, I've heard that about you.
- Just make the trade.
Me for Jenna.
Oh, my God.
What is it? He wants to take my place.
- How's Tyler doing? - Sleeping.
He should be better by morning.
He just He needs some rest.
Good.
So this is your life now, huh? Never a dull moment.
You know, these last few days with you have been so great, and fun, and So Caroline.
I thought that I might be able to get past this whole vampire thing.
But you can.
- Matt - I don't know if I can, Caroline.
Matt.
I get it.
This is your life now.
But you know what my life is, Car? My life is an absentee mom.
And a bunch of bills to pay, and school and a job, and it sucks sometimes.
But it's my life.
And I think that I just wanna live it without all of this.
Come on, Bonnie, we got a hybrid to kill.
- It's done.
- That's it? Let's go.
- I'll be back soon.
- Wait, what do you mean? I'm coming.
I need to be there.
I need to make sure you are okay.
- Who's gonna make sure you're okay? - I've got my ring.
Look, I'm not taking no for an answer.
Easy.
Easy.
Just go.
I'll stay with him.
It's time.
- I got the weapons in the car.
- Bonnie's the only weapon we need.
Bonnie, what is this? - I can't put anyone at risk.
- I can't stay with Jenna out there.
- I'm sorry.
- You can't do this.
Damon? Sorry, buddy.
She's right.
No.
You can't do this.
Bonnie.
Bonnie! - Elena - I have to do something.
This can't happen.
None of it.
Quite the predicament.
You know, it's funny, all this talk about preserving family and here's Stefan, granting your wish.
Stefan.
It's okay.
Well who's it gonna be, Elena? No.
Oh, don't worry.
There's actually no choice.
No.
Stefan.
No.
I have other plans for your boyfriend.
I want him alive.
But for now Whenever you're ready, Greta.
No.
- Your turn.
- No, Jenna, no.
It's all right, Elena.
I know what I have to do.
Jenna, no.
Just turn it off.
Jenna, turn it off.
You won't be scared anymore.
No! Jenna! No, Jenna.
No.
I'm so sorry.
Shh.
Are they gonna kill him? Yes.
It's time.
Thank you, Elena.
Go to hell.
No.
I can feel it.
It's happening.
Yes, yes.
No.
You were dead.
Elena.
- I need you to get her out of here.
- What about you? I'm not leaving until he's dead.
Go.
Elijah? Hello, brother.
In the name of our family, Niklaus.
I didn't bury them at sea.
- What? - Their bodies are safe.
If you kill me, you'll never find them.
Elijah.
Don't listen to him.
Elijah, I can take you to them.
I give you my word, brother.
- Do it and I'll take you both out.
- You'll die.
I don't care.
Brother.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
No.
We should have heard from them by now.
Did you read all this? I did.
You understand what happened to the mother after the baby was brought back to life.
She saved her daughter.
She found peace.
John I need you to give this to Elena for me.
And also this.
Oh, hey, what's going on here? Take care of each other.
Please.
I think they're here.
Come back as a vampire, I'll stake you myself.
So don't.
Because I can't stand the idea of you hating me forever.
How is she? I don't know yet.
What about Jenna? No.
I'm sorry, Jeremy.
- Elena.
- Hey.
Damon, I How do you feel? I feel fine.
- Hey.
- Oh.
Yeah, you got shot.
But it's healing.
You were right.
I shouldn't have come home.
No, you just You should have never left.
And you shouldn't leave again.
You're kidding, right? This is the second time I've tried to kill you.
Well, no friendship is perfect.
Matt broke up with me.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, you know, instead of just bailing on me again, you could just say: "Thank you, Caroline, for taking care of me.
And I'm sorry that I tried to chow down on you again.
" Hey.
Hey.
Come here.
Oh, easy.
Thank you, Caroline for taking care of me.
You're welcome.
We all set? Yeah.
Plenty of room at the Gilbert family plot and I compelled two of the grave diggers to do the dirty work.
How's she doing? She lost the only parents she had.
She's in shock.
- I'm almost ready.
- Yeah, take your time.
John wanted me to give you this.
And this.
Jeremy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry that you've lost so many people.
I still have you.
Elena it's no easy task being an ordinary parent to an extraordinary child.
I failed in that task.
And because of my prejudices, I failed you.
I'm haunted by how things might have played out if I'd been more willing to hear your side of things.
For me, it's the end.
For you, a chance to grow old and someday do better with your own child than I did with mine.
It's for that child that I give you my ring.
I don't ask for your forgiveness or for you to forget.
I ask only that you believe this.
Whether you are now reading this as a human or as a vampire I love you all the same.
As I've always loved you and always will.
John.
I'm gonna head back to the house.
I think I'll skip the coffee and tea cakes.
Damon, she needs us right now.
All of us.
And then what's the plan, Stefan? The curse is broken.
How does one go about killing an all-powerful wolf-vamp and his two-faced older brother? I have no idea.
We need to get an idea.
Fast.
I'm not gonna let Elena lose anybody else.
I wouldn't make any promises.
- What's that supposed to mean? - Tyler Lockwood bit me.
It's actually more of a nip, really, but there it is.
We'll find something.
A cure.
There's no cure, Stefan.
We kept Elena human, right? We found the way when there was no way.
Hey.
I will do this.
You wanna do something for me? Keep this from Elena.
Last thing she needs is another grave to mourn.
