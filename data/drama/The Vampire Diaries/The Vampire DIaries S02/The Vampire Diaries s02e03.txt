Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
- What are you? - I'm a vampire.
Tell me about your ex, Katherine? She broke your heart.
That was a long time ago.
Why do I look like her? - What's your problem? - I don't know, okay? - So the black sheep returns.
- Tyler? - Who's the guy with Caroline? - Mason Lockwood.
The Lockwoods have a secret.
They're not vampires.
They're something else.
I love Stefan.
It's always gonna be Stefan.
No, Damon.
Stop it, ahh! It's Katherine.
She undid everything good about him.
I hate him, Stefan.
I fed her blood.
Katherine obviously killed her.
- And A plus B equals - Because I'm starving.
Thanks for coming, Ric.
Can I get you something to drink? Coffee, bourbon, bourbon in your coffee? - Elena mentioned you needed my help.
- Yeah.
We were, uh, hoping you could help shed some light on the Lockwood family.
Why would I know anything about the Lockwoods? Well, you wouldn't.
But your dead Not-dead vampire wife might.
Isobel's research from when you guys were at Duke together.
You said that she had spent years researching this town.
Isobel's research here in Mystic Falls was rooted in folklore and legend.
At the time, I thought most of which was fiction.
Like that amazing vampire story.
- Aside from vampires, what else? - The lycanthrope.
Wait, like werewolves? No way.
Impossible.
- Way too Lon Chaney.
- Is it? I've been on this planet 160 some odd years, never come across one.
If werewolves exist, where the hell are they? Why suspect the Lockwoods? Vervain didn't affect the mayor on Founders Day, the Gilbert device did.
And it affected his son Tyler.
And at the school carnival, his Uncle Mason exhibited inhuman behavior when he fought one of the carnival workers.
It suggested some sort of a supernatural entity.
We were hoping that Isobel's research could help us figure out what it is.
Well, all of her things are still at Duke.
Ahem.
I mean, her office is still there.
She's technically still missing.
So can we get access to it? Ric, we need to know what we're dealing with.
If this wolfman thing is true, I've seen enough movies to know it's not good.
It means Mason Lockwood is a real-life Lon Chaney.
And that little Tyler punk may just very well be Lon Chaney Jr.
Which means Bela Lugosi, meaning me, is totally screwed.
Caroline? Caroline? CAROLINE It's Caroline.
Leave a message.
Hey, uh, I thought you said you were at home.
Tyler's doing a thing at the swimming hole.
I wanted us to spend the day together.
Where are you? Call me.
- Are you sure you wanna do this? - Which part? Digging through my birth mother's lifework or going to Duke with Damon? Heh, either.
Both.
Well, I'm sure about the first part.
But then again, Ric is a good buffer.
So we can bond in our anti-Damon solidarity.
I wish you were coming, though.
You know what, maybe we should wait a couple of days, huh? Wait till, uh, Caroline's less of a danger, and then I can go with you.
It's okay that I'm going, right? Be honest, if it's not, I can stay here.
- We can take care of Caroline.
- No, I want you to go.
Okay? I do.
You have questions about your lineage and about Katherine and I'm not gonna let the fact that Damon is going keep you from an opportunity to get some answers.
- You hate it, though.
- I hate it.
- But I love you.
- I love you too.
It's been a while.
Heh, well, school's been keeping me, you know, busy.
I want you to know it means a lot to me that Elena has a connection to her mother.
I appreciate you bringing her along.
Yeah.
Well, I figured it was time to take care of my wife's things, you know? Look, Jenna, I know, uh, things between you and I have been a little start-and-stop.
And I'm sorry for that.
- But maybe once I can - Uh, no, don't do that.
Not the "half, maybe apology, hope for the future" thing.
Elena, are you coming? Do what you need to do, okay? - Hey, you okay? - Heh, yeah.
Just men and their baggage, heh.
Sorry you can't come too, Stef.
- Call me if you need anything.
- I'll take good care of her.
Okay, time to go.
Bye.
Have you ever been down to those old ruins in the woods? - The old Lockwood estate? - Yeah.
What do you know about it? It was the original plantation house.
Beautiful antebellum architecture.
And if it hadn't burnt to the ground, we'd probably be living in it.
Hmm.
What's the deal with the freaky underground cellar? We don't talk about those kind of rooms.
- Why not? - Well, this is the South, honey.
But no one likes to reminisce about the old slave days.
Hey.
What are you guys talking about? We were just talking about the old Lockwood property.
Thinking of having friends over.
Be careful.
If anything happens on the property, the family is liable.
Of course.
I don't know how to make a day-walking ring.
Emily made mine, made Damon's too.
Instructions must be in the Grimoire.
- That doesn't mean I can cast a spell.
- Bonnie, ahem.
You know how to drop vampires with a single look.
Okay? I think you can figure it out.
Caroline killed someone, Stefan.
I can't make it easier for her to do it.
We're not making it easier for her.
We're giving her the chance to survive.
Every day she's cut off from her old life, from you, from Elena, from Matt it'll make it harder for her to hold on to her humanity.
- You know she won't hurt anyone else? - I don't.
But if we don't do everything we can or at least trust the fact that she can keep it together we might as well just stake her right now.
I don't know if I can trust her.
Not with this.
Then trust me.
How are you doing back there? You know, this whole pretending to hate me thing is getting a little silly.
Heh, I don't think she's pretending.
You did kill her brother.
There is a huge asterisk next to that statement.
He came back to life.
Thanks to a ring you didn't know he was wearing.
- Why are you sure I didn't know? - Did you? Yes.
- You're lying.
- Elena, I saw the ring.
It's a big, tacky thing.
It's hard to miss.
So I don't get to choose the ring I have to wear the rest of my life? - Hey, if you don't want it - No, she She wants it.
- Now what? - The part where I explain the rules.
The witch who spells the ring has the power to de-spell it.
- So if you do anything to hurt anyone - I'm not gonna hurt anyone.
You're a vampire.
That means the urge to kill is a part of who you are.
The minute you let it take over, I will stop you.
- You're supposed to be my friend.
- I can't ignore what happened, okay? You're gonna have to prove that the Caroline I remember isn't gone.
Now put the ring on the bed.
Do you really think I meant to kill that guy at the carnival? He's still dead.
Now, do you want me to cast the spell or not? All done.
Hmm So that's it? I mean, nothing witchy happened, heh.
You know, no flickering lights, no gusts of wind.
- Have you even done this before? - Caroline.
Well, I just wanna make sure it worked.
It worked.
What if it hadn't, Bonnie? She's all yours.
So Isobel was officially employed by the Anthropology Department given that most paranormal phenomena is rooted in folklore.
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Alaric Saltzman.
- I called earlier.
- Yes.
Uh, of course.
I'm Vanessa Monroe, research assistant.
Comparative folklore.
Oh, let me grab Isobel's keys.
Sorry, my friends Elena and Damon.
I hope this isn't an imposition.
Oh, please, Isobel's office is right through there.
Isobel was one of my first professors.
I'm a grad student.
She was brilliant.
And one of the reasons I went into folklore.
I have to ask, um - has there been any news? - No, no, I'm afraid not.
It's right this way.
I'll grab the light.
Feel free to look around.
It's fascinating, isn't it? Mm-hm.
Where did she go? Hurry.
Pull it out.
I can't reach it, Elena.
Just pull the damn thing out.
It hurts.
- That bitch is dead.
- Uh, you're not gonna kill her.
Watch me.
You touch her and I swear I will never speak to you again.
What makes you think that has any power over me? Because I took an arrow in the back for you? You are severely overestimating yourself.
Right, I forgot that I was speaking to a psychotic mind who snaps and kills people impulsively.
- Fine, go ahead, do whatever you want.
- You're trying to manipulate me.
If by manipulate you mean tell the truth, okay, guilty.
Okay.
Please.
Okay, I freaked.
You would have done the same thing.
It is not possible.
Katherine Pierce can't be alive.
And Damon Salvatore died in 1864.
Okay, I read Isobel's research.
Well, then you should know just how possible this is.
I'm Elena Gilbert.
Isobel's daughter and a descendent of Katherine Pierce.
And this is Damon Salvatore, who you just shot.
I'd be extra nice to me right now.
Look, we need your help, okay? We need to see all of Isobel's research.
Anything related to Mystic Falls.
So, what do I do when I see the rabbit? Chase it, catch it, feed on it.
Isn't killing cute, defenseless animals the first step in becoming a serial killer? You sort of skipped serial killer and went straight to vampire.
If you're not serious about this, you should tell me.
No, I am.
Look, I swear that I am, okay? But it's just I haven't been in the sun for days.
Everyone's at the swimming hole, and Matt is there.
He finally told me he loved me, but I've been blowing him off.
And now you want me to eat bunnies, and I'm kind of freaking out, okay? - Now you're laughing at me.
- No, I'm not laughing.
None of this is funny, trust me.
It's, heh It's just that, uh - What? - When someone becomes a vampire all of their natural behaviors get sort of, uh, uh, amplified.
What do you mean? I mean, uh, as a human, I cared deeply for people and how they felt.
Uh, if they were hurting, I felt their pain.
And I felt guilty if I caused it.
And, uh, as a vampire, all of that got magnified.
So you're saying, that now I'm basically an insecure, neurotic, control freak on crack.
Well, I wasn't gonna say it like that, but - Hey, listen.
Let's hunt, okay? - Ugh.
And then after that - we'll go to the swimming hole.
- Really? Matt is the closest connection to your humanity.
And I think that being around him is a good thing.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Okay.
Bunnies.
This box tracks Katherine's arrival to Mystic Falls in April of 1864.
- Is that all there is about her? - All that I'm aware of.
Here.
Take this.
- Does vervain really work? - Nope, not at all.
Can he hear us? No, that would be creepy.
Can he read minds too? You know, if you wanna see me naked, all you have to do is ask.
No.
That, he can't do.
He is very capable of being a first-rate jackass.
Is it me, or did Aimee Bradley's ass get hot? All class, all class.
- Where's Forbes? - I wish I knew.
- You guys on the outs already? - No, we're fine.
I'm fine.
I'm just not sure where she is.
What's your uncle doing here? You busting us, or are you joining us? Neither.
You make sure everyone's out of here by dark.
- What happens after dark? - Someone ends up wasted and dead.
You heard your mom.
The family's liable.
Don't be a party-killer.
I didn't say to stop partying.
I said to take it elsewhere.
All right.
We'll be out of here.
Why are you looking at him with your serious vampire look? My what? My serious vampire look? Mm-hm.
It's different from your worried vampire look.
Neither stray too far from your "Hey, it's Tuesday" look.
Oh, I get it.
Okay, you think I'm, uh You think I'm too serious, that it? I mean, I wasn't gonna say it like that, but Hmm.
- Hey, Aimee.
- Thanks.
You're missing all the fun.
- Ugh, not waterproof.
- Too bad.
So, uh, there's a full moon tonight.
We gonna light a fire later and tell ghost stories? - I don't know.
Heh-heh-heh.
- Matt.
I've been calling you.
I know, I got held up.
But I'm here now.
Hey, Caroline.
Go find somebody single to stalk, Aimee.
- Seriously? - Heh, she was flirting with you.
She's harmless.
You don't have to be rude.
- You're mad? - You've been dodging my calls all day.
And you get to show up here and be the jealous girlfriend? It's kind of lame, Care.
- Hey, I saw that, you compelled her.
- Yeah, she deserved it.
Caroline, nobody deserves to have their mind messed with for shallow reasons.
You know, why is everyone sticking up for Aimee freaking Bradley? You're letting your jealousy get the best of you.
Oh, so now I have magnified jealousy issues too.
That's great.
I told you this wasn't gonna be easy.
Yeah, well, might as well have stayed dead.
My entire personality is killing me.
Shut up.
Any luck? There's nothing in here about Katherine that we don't already know.
Oh, man.
You know, it's a bummer we're not friends anymore.
I could tell you what I know.
Now who's manipulating who? Hey, guys, check this out.
There's no record of werewolf mythology in Mystic Falls.
But here are some records of some of the lesser known legends.
Everything from, uh, Scandinavian skin-walkers to the Maréchal de Retz.
Which roughly translates into "the curse of the sun and moon.
" - It's Native American.
- Aztec.
It explains one origin of the werewolf curse traced through Virginia.
The short story: 600 years ago the Aztecs were plagued by werewolves and vampires.
They terrorized the countryside, made farming and hunting impossible.
Until an Aztec shaman cursed them.
Making vampires slaves to the sun and werewolves servants of the moon.
As a result, vampires could only prowl at night and werewolves could only turn on a full moon.
When the full moon crests in the sky, who's ever unlucky enough to fall under the werewolf curse turns into a wolf.
Can they control the transformation? If it were a choice, it wouldn't be called a curse.
Werewolves will attack humans.
But instinct and centuries of rivalry have hardwired them to hunt their prey of choice: Vampires.
Well, if werewolves are hunting vampires, I would know about it.
Not if there aren't that many werewolves left alive.
Hundreds of years ago, vampires hunted them almost to extinction.
- Why do that? - To protect themselves.
Legend has it that a werewolf bite is fatal to vampires.
Oh.
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, guys.
Tyler wants us out of here.
We gotta move the party.
He's mad at me.
Go talk to him.
I'll wait.
- Hey.
- Hi.
We've learned some stuff here.
And I know it's gonna sound crazy, but I wanted to fill you in.
What's up? Still mad? I thought we were past all this insecurity stuff, Caroline.
I told you how I felt.
What more do you need? Nothing, nothing.
L I don't need anything else.
I'm sorry, Matt.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so, so sorry.
I'm not kidding.
- I'm not gonna put up with the drama.
- No, no more drama.
Just I promise.
Just Just this.
Come on.
I don't know what it means, or if we should even believe it, but it's a full moon, Stefan.
- After what you saw Mason Lockwood do - I'll be careful.
- There's one more thing.
- What is it? According to the legend, a werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
Listen, um, I gotta go.
- I'II, uh, see you when you get home, okay? - Okay.
- What is this place? - Relax.
Wait, what is this place? It's a, you know Not much farther, Aimee.
Ha, ha, really, Tyler? You drag me all the way out here? I had to move the party.
So I'm moving the party.
- Where are we going? - It's right around this tree.
- Are you sure? - Oh, yeah, come on.
- What is this place? - It's a ruin.
Buried underneath my family's old estate.
- No one will know we're down here.
- Is everyone else coming? Yeah.
Unless you rather I tell them not to.
- You're single, right? - Oh, yeah.
Let's go.
Hey, um, have you done any research on doppelgangers? Well, the word means a lot of different things to different cultures.
But typically a doppelganger is a living, breathing double of oneself.
Did Isobel have anything that'd explain the link between me and Katherine? That's all she had on Katherine, unfortunately.
But I can tell you that doppelgangers usually torment the people they look like trying to undo their lives.
It's not exactly uplifting.
And more things we already know.
Just I wanna know why we look alike.
- Head-scratcher, isn't it? - Do you know something? Or are you just being yourself? Well, if I know anything, I'm not gonna tell you.
Not with that attitude.
That's good.
And this is coming from someone who wants to be my friend.
But you know what? Friends don't manipulate friends.
They help each other.
Wait, wait.
No, I'm sorry.
What's the deal? Come on.
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, I can't.
I'm I'm not into it.
- Then why'd you come with me? - I don't know.
I'm not even really sure why I was flirting with you.
L I like Matt.
Ouch! Um - Okay, uh - I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
Wow.
Um Thanks.
I trust you, uh, not to say anything about this to anyone.
Or else Damon will kill me in my sleep? He gave me the 411.
But if you need anything, you'll call? Hopefully I won't have to.
But if you do Listen, you don't wanna get caught up in this.
Really.
It'll take over.
And it'll keep you from being able to live your life.
Isobel's disappearance was it related to her research? Isobel became her research.
Uh, she wanted to become a vampire.
She got her wish.
I guess that would put a strain on a marriage.
Uh Anyway, I was wondering what it would, uh, be like to come back here.
It's, uh It's okay.
It's really okay.
It feels good to have her in my past.
You know, it's time to move beyond this.
Hmm.
Here.
Allow me.
You're not gonna be able to hate me forever.
Can we just go? You didn't dig deep enough.
"Petrova"? - I saw this on the shelf.
- Katherine originally came from Europe.
Petrova was her real name.
Katerina Petrova to be exact.
How did you know that? Back when, I saw it engraved on an old heirloom.
Men snoop too, you know.
Let me know what you find.
Very curious myself.
You have every right to hate me.
I understand.
You hated me before and we became friends.
It would suck if that was gone forever.
So is it? Have I lost you forever? Thank you for the book, Damon.
This looks like the spot.
For what? Did you hear that? Argh, damn.
- What happened? - I'm a klutz.
What's the matter? What? What are you doing? Caroline? Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.
What the hell? Your face.
Stop it.
Hey, stop, stop, stop.
Stop.
- Oh, my God.
- No, no.
No, stop.
Listen to me.
We need to get out of these woods.
Now.
- We need to leave.
- What was that? Matt, stay down.
Do not move.
You and me, we're gonna run, okay? It's gonna follow us, we'll lead it away from Matt.
So you need to run as fast as you can.
Do you understand me? Go, go.
- Wait, what is it? - It's a werewolf.
- It will try to kill us, and it can.
- Hey.
What are you two doing? What are you doing here? Stefan! No! You're not gonna remember what I did to you.
Or what you saw me become.
We were just making out in the woods.
And then an animal attacked you.
- And bit your neck.
- It's weird, it just came out of nowhere.
What are we gonna do about Tyler? I took care of it.
I'll get Matt on vervain.
Keep you from being able to compel him.
But it'll also keep you from being able to drink his blood.
- I can't believe I hurt him.
- I know.
He's the one person on this entire planet that I never wanted to hurt.
It's not gonna get any easier.
You're just gonna have to work that much harder.
I shouldn't be with him, should I? Not if there's any danger.
I'm the last person to make that decision for you.
If I followed my advice, I would've walked away from Elena a long time ago.
Do you ever think you should have? I know I should have.
I just can't.
Wanna toss me those? It was you.
I can't believe an animal attacked you.
Yeah.
There have been a lot of animal attacks lately.
- Well, are you okay? - I've been better, heh.
- How are you? - I'm okay, I'm worried about you.
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.
- Seriously, Aimee? - We were just talking.
- Is that what you call it? - Yeah, heh.
- Are you kidding me? - No, I'm not, Matt.
She's into you and anyone can see it.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to I'm just gonna go.
Knock it off.
- What are you doing? - This isn't my fault, Matt.
She's after you, and I shouldn't have to put up with that.
- I thought you said no more drama.
- Well, I lied.
Just forget it.
Just forget all of it.
So, what? Are you, like, breaking up with me? Yeah.
Yeah, I guess that's what I'm doing.
Ric, I wasn't expecting you and Elena till later.
I should've done that this morning.
Road trips work for us.
This doesn't mean things are back to the way they used to be.
Oh, come on.
You know I chipped a little bit off of your wall of hatred.
I need to know the truth.
When you broke Jeremy's neck did you know that he was wearing the ring? No.
No, I didn't.
Katherine really pissed me off, and I snapped, and I got lucky with the ring.
I don't know what I would've done if he wasn't wearing it.
Elena, I'm sorry.
Thank you for being honest with me.
And the answer to your question about our friendship is yes.
You have lost me forever.
But you knew that already, didn't you? You used me today.
You had information I needed to know.
I thought friends don't manipulate friends.
You and Katherine have a lot more in common than just your looks.
- Elena? - Nope, try again.
Katherine.
Don't be frightened.
We're gonna have so much fun together.
