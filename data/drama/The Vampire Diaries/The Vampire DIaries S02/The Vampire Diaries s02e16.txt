Previously on The Vampire Diaries: - You must be Elena.
- How do we look alike? You're a Petrova doppelganger.
Key to breaking the curse.
- Sun and the moon curse? - Klaus is real.
First generation vampire.
The oldest vampire in the history of time is after me? Elijah.
He's one of the Originals.
I'm prepared to offer a deal.
- What kind of a deal? - We'll draw Klaus out, I'll make certain - your friends are unharmed.
- Then? - I kill him.
- I come bearing gifts.
This is how you kill an Original.
Killing Elijah would be a suicide mission.
You can't do it.
Even with the dagger and white ash? If you kill Elijah, then I'm stuck in here forever.
As long as we keep the dagger there, he stays dead.
- Pretty much.
- How did you get out? I knew that if I begged you not to kill Elijah that's exactly what you'd do.
As soon as Originals die, compulsion wears off.
What did Luka tell you? He told me about your daughter.
I know Klaus has her.
I want to help you get her back.
Please.
No.
He took my powers.
Stefan, we're late for school.
- Let's be later.
- Stefan, it's school.
That thing we're forgetting about? - Hey.
- School? Heh, mm-mm.
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- Stefan.
Stefan.
Okay, five minutes.
- Only five minutes.
- Five minutes? Good morning, Damon.
What are you doing here? - What is your problem? - Wear her clothes? Like that's going to work.
You think I'm Katherine? Why would you think that? Katherine's in a tomb.
Isn't she? What the hell's going on here? I don't know, you tell me.
Is Katherine in the tomb or not? - What are you doing? - How could you do this? - Stefan, you're hurting me.
Aah! - Stop it, Katherine.
Stop what? It's getting really easy being you.
- What is she doing here? - When we killed Elijah it broke the compulsion, freed her.
- How's that possible? - He's Original.
They have all sorts of special skills.
I don't want you here.
Get her out of here.
You need me, Elena.
You all do.
- Like hell.
- We all want the same thing: Klaus dead.
Yet here you all are running like chickens with their heads cut off.
I don't need your help and I don't want it.
And that's incredibly stupid of you.
Do you know where Klaus is? When he's coming, what he looks like? If you know something, say it or get out.
Fine.
Then I'll just go to the Grill and have some lunch, maybe Aunt Jenna's free for a bite.
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.
- Live band? - Yeah, business has been a little slow.
The Grill's trying to stay afloat.
Aren't we all? Ha, ha.
Have you heard from Tyler? Not a peep.
You? Not since he stopped by to talk and I've left messages on his cell phone.
He stopped by to see you? What did he say? Not much, really.
I mean I think to say goodbye without really saying goodbye.
- And I just didn't know it.
- And that's all he said? Yeah.
Yeah, that's all he said, Caroline.
Why? I mean, is there something you want to tell me? Yeah.
I I mean, no, I - It's just not that easy.
- I don't get it.
Since when can I express myself and you're one with a loss for words? No, you're right, and I'm sorry.
You know how I feel.
So it's your move.
Just make a decision or leave me alone.
Why is she still here? She was free.
She wants what we want, Klaus dead.
Maybe she sees us as her only chance.
Maybe she's trying to lure you and Damon back into her web.
- I want her gone.
- So do I.
But you're right, she stayed.
Shouldn't we try to figure out why? How? All she does is lie.
Look, I hate it as much as you do, but she does make a point.
We don't know anything about Klaus.
She does.
Right, but that doesn't mean I want her shacking up with you.
All right.
Maybe we should stay at your place tonight.
I can't.
I told Bonnie and Caroline that they could come over.
Bonnie's freaked because she lost her powers and Caroline's having Matt drama again.
It's kind of a girls' night.
Maybe Katherine can join us.
Come on.
Ooh.
Burning flesh.
If you're trying to get the dagger you're wasting time.
He's indestructible.
No kidding.
How do you know so much about Original vampires? - Spend 500 years running from one.
- When I told you my plan to kill Elijah why didn't you warn me that I'd die if I used a dagger on him? Oh, there's so many rules.
It's all very confusing.
- Did you know I would die? - Did Elijah tell you his plan? Did he have a dagger to kill Klaus with? Why are you still here? Because you haven't forcibly removed me.
You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.
Damon, be smart.
I want Klaus dead just as much as you do.
More.
If I wasn't being honest about helping I'd be long gone by now, okay? You can hate me.
But we want the same thing.
And you know I always get what I want.
I wanted out of the tomb.
Didn't matter who paid the price.
Of course I knew that you'd die.
- She's out of the tomb? - Yeah.
We're dealing with it.
Just be careful.
She's getting too good - impersonating Elena.
- With Katherine we gotta find a way to get your powers back.
I want the Martins on our side.
I want for us to work together - now that Elijah's out of the picture.
- It's impossible.
They hate us.
It's either win them over or somebody's going to end up dead.
You think you can at least convince them to have a civil conversation? - I'll try.
- Thanks.
Keep me posted.
Okay.
I gotta get to class.
All right, I'll see you.
Heh.
Come on.
Elena's nowhere in sight.
I'll tell her soon.
I promise.
All right.
It was bad.
You know, John planted all these seeds about Isobel - and now Jenna knows I'm lying.
- John's gonna end up dead on the floor.
Yeah, well, easier said than done.
I gave him back his ring.
So Look, Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.
You know, was she murdered? Why haven't they found the body? I mean, how much longer can she stay in the dark? You think we should tell her the truth? I can't be with her and not tell her.
It's not fair and not a relationship I want.
Not to mention it's becoming more dangerous for her not to know.
I thought that we'd hold off until after we've dealt with Klaus.
You know, and even then how do we tell someone what we know? How does someone hear that? Look, I'm sorry to put this on you.
You know, but I feel it's your decision to make.
And whatever you decide to do, I'll respect it.
I want to be honest with her.
But until then Jenna and I are done.
- Thank you for coming.
- I didn't want to.
But my son made a case to hear you out.
Bonnie said that you have information about Elijah.
Elijah's dead.
I'm sorry.
Hear me out.
We can help you.
Please.
We know that Klaus has your daughter.
Sorry about the way I got that information but it's good that we know.
We can all work together to get her back.
- How? - I suspect you and Elijah had a plan to kill Klaus.
Let us help you carry it out.
You can trust us.
I give you my word.
We all do.
- What you up to? - None of your business.
We're pouting now? Are those the Gilbert journals? - "Eighteen sixty-four.
" - How am I supposed to help you - if you won't tell me? - Can you tell me where witches were massacred in this town a couple centuries ago? - No.
- Then you can't help.
If it's any consolation I'm glad that you're not dead.
Emily Bennett told me about the massacre.
It was a big deal in witch folklore.
When a witch dies violently, they release a mystical energy making the place of their death with power.
Elijah wanted to know the site of the massacre.
- What was he gonna do when he found it? - I don't know.
What did papa and baby witch have to say? Isn't she gone or dead yet? For the last time, I'm here to help.
Can we skip the secrets, hmm? Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.
But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power they wouldn't need one.
Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches? We just need to find it.
- What if they can find the burial ground? - They won't.
We tried, Luka, for weeks.
We don't have a back-up plan and we need to be doing everything we can.
We will save her.
But Elijah is the answer, not Stefan and his brother.
Those people, they're our enemies.
They need to be dealt with.
- What, you're going to kill them? - No.
I'm going to let Elijah do it.
- Chinese food or pizza? - Hmm, like you have to ask.
I will get it.
I'll do it.
Do you believe that Jonas is being sincere? I don't know what to believe.
I think he's at a loss.
He's not sure who to trust.
Join the club.
Well, what are we going to do about this movie situation? The Notebook? Caroline, how many times have you seen that movie? - That is so not the point.
- Well, yeah, I mean - Hey.
- What's going on? Girls' night.
Oh.
How are you doing? You heard about my fight with Ric.
He feels terrible.
Is this some kind of attempt to cheer me up? No.
No, this is about us girls hanging out.
And, you know, we'll be here if you happen to want to talk, or Because I am a winner when it comes to successful relationships.
- You too? - You have no idea.
Okay, then.
This whole Isobel thing.
He's hiding something from me.
To play devil's advocate, maybe there is a great reason why he's not telling you.
Maybe he is just trying to protect you.
Well, that's not his call to make.
- I deserve the truth.
Everybody does.
- Sometimes it's harder than that.
Not if it's somebody you care about, it isn't.
You know what we need? Dancing.
There is a band at the Grill.
- I'm in.
- In.
In.
In.
Are you sure about this? I mean, I would go if I could.
No.
I'm not strong enough to send you.
But I can do this.
I'll stay anchored.
Use all my energy.
- Lf you feel weak - Dad.
I want this just as much as you.
Concentrate on Elijah.
Picture him in your mind.
I got it.
I'm in the Salvatore house.
Elijah's body must be there.
What do you see? Elena and Damon.
They're reading.
Good.
If Elijah's there, you'll sense him.
Stay focused.
Can I help you? I'm bored.
"Emily Bennett was taken by the Council today.
They kidnapped her and took her to the same location her ancestors were burned a hundred years ago.
" So Emily died on the site of the massacre too.
- Mm-hm.
- Does it say where? Nope.
You know this whole friendly, cooperative thing? - Mm-hm.
- I don't buy it.
I have no reason to lie to you, Damon.
Lie.
I'm hungry.
You're the unwanted houseguest.
Go feed yourself.
Well, nothing in any of these.
Find anything? Nope.
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, bummer.
Elena's fighting me.
What's wrong? She's stronger than me.
That's because it's not Elena.
It's Katherine Pierce.
Luka, kill her.
- What? - She's a vampire.
Find a stake and drive it through her heart.
Damon.
Katherine.
What happened? Damon Luka, what's going on? Luka.
Luka! - What are you doing? - Some kind of crazy psychic witch attack.
Get over there and do something about it.
Go.
No! Oh, my God.
Luka.
Luka.
I'm sorry.
Please.
Just wake up, son.
Open your eyes.
Luka.
My boy.
Counting on tonight, stuck on you Counting on a fight Punch-drunk truth Sorry I returned Sorry I was late Now the tables have turned Just a simple twist of fate Don't it make you feel small In light of the world Don't it make you feel tall A beautiful girl Wow.
I know the plan, I know what I got coming Put the pistol in my hand And then she started running I need a drink.
Take anything you want Hey, Matt.
Let me get that for you.
Things just got real awkward.
- Jenna.
- Not tonight, Ric.
Tonight I have traded you for senor tequila.
Yeah.
Ha.
Well, senor tequila's not going to be treating you very well.
Well, the two of you have a lot in common.
- I hate that you're this upset with me.
- Yeah, well, it's your fault.
Whatever it is you're keeping from me whatever you think I can't handle you're wrong.
Because last year I was a grad student who smoked a lot of pot and couldn't keep a goldfish alive.
And now I'm a parent so I think I can handle anything, Ric.
- Jenna.
- He said the ball's in your court.
Yeah, but I can't do anything about it.
Why not? All you do is talk about how much you care about him.
Yeah, but I am still keeping so many secrets.
Alaric's in the same boat with Jenna.
And maybe that's our mistake.
We're trying to protect people by keeping them out of it, but in the end, we're hurting them anyway.
What are you doing? Where are you going? Where is she going? Hey, everybody.
Let's hear it for the band.
Aren't they awesome? This isn't gonna end well.
So there's this guy.
And, uh, he told me to tell him how I feel about him.
Ha, ha.
Like it's so easy.
Um, just because I talk a lot doesn't mean I always know what I'm actually talking about.
Like now, I'm feeling loopy and I don't really know how to express myself.
I can sing.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Sing? You know what, I'm gonna sing.
Come on, off the stage.
You are gonna let me live out my rock fantasies and you are going to be my back-up.
What will it be? Close your eyes Give me your hand, darlin' Do you feel my heart beating? She's good.
Do you understand? Yeah.
Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming? Is this burning An eternal flame? I believe it's meant to be, darlin' I watch you when you are sleeping You belong to me Do you feel the same? Am I only dreaming? Is this burning An eternal flame? Say my name Sun shines through the rain A whole life so Ionely You come and ease the pain I don't want to lose this feeling Oh! Oh! Matt, I You killed him.
- He's dead and I have no one.
- Aah! No.
And now you're about to find out exactly what that feels like.
There you go.
What the hell? That's for not telling me the dagger would kill me.
Next time it goes in your heart.
Is that how you treat someone who - is trying to help you? - You wanna help? - Start talking.
- I'd love to but you're not gonna like it.
- Try me.
- Fine.
John Gilbert and Isobel want you and Stefan out of Elena's life.
That's old news.
Not the part where he offered me a deal.
He knew that killing Elijah would get me out of the tomb so he gave me a choice.
Either I stay and help with Klaus, or he kills Stefan.
But he still tried to have me killed.
Right.
That was part of the deal.
I could only save one of you.
So you chose Stefan.
Of course you did.
You wanted the truth, Damon.
Would you rather I lie? Uh, oh, sorry.
Sorry, Elena.
- I really have to get back to work.
- Definitely.
Uh, I wouldn't.
Caroline and Matt are - In the bathroom? - Lf they're happy, I'm happy.
Um, hey, uh, speaking of happy would it freak you out if I started dating your brother? - You're into my brother? - I know it's weird but he's been so good and strong.
He makes me happy.
And I really can't tell what you're thinking right now.
I'm thinking that my brother has had more pain in his life than a hundred people's worth of pain and he deserves to be with someone as amazing as you.
Really? Really.
Phone.
Hey, Stefan, I'm at the Grill.
I can't hear you.
Hold Yeah.
Where are you going? Luka Martin's dead.
His father's going after Elena.
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.
- Wait.
- I don't need your help.
- I don't want it.
- I know what we can do, Damon.
You have to let me do it.
Dr.
Martin.
You okay? Where is she? I don't understand.
My son is dead.
Whatever it is you think you need to do, there's a better way.
They killed Elijah and they killed Luka.
And my only shot at getting my daughter back is Elena.
No.
No, Dr.
Martin.
Where is she? I don't know.
I haven't seen her.
What the hell? - The power's out.
- Ha.
Even better.
I wish, but I should probably Hey.
- We have a problem.
- What's going on? Jonas is here and he's after Elena.
- Oh, my God.
- We have a plan but I need to get Elena out of here.
- Well, what can I do? - It's time to get out of here.
- Have to find Elena.
- She's with Stefan, she's okay.
No one's getting out of here until I have her.
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
Bonnie.
Hey, Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Hey, Bonnie.
Come on.
Come on.
Dr.
Martin.
I'm so sorry about Luka.
We never wanted that to happen but let us help you get your daughter back.
Only Elijah can do that.
You don't need Elijah.
Caroline.
Get away from her.
Matt, no! Matt! Matt.
No.
Matt.
Matt.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Just breathe, Caroline, just breathe.
You have to drink.
Please, please.
Luka.
I can't believe he's dead.
- After what we did to him.
- No, after what he did to you.
Look, I'm sorry, I know you feel bad about all this - but I don't.
- I couldn't do anything to help.
I was useless.
I hated it.
- Thank God.
- It's not over yet.
- What's going on? - He'll explain.
When did you guys get home? - A few minutes ago.
- Did you check the house? And why would we check the house? You're welcome.
- You didn't have to kill him.
- Yes, we did.
Get off.
How did you guys convince her to do this? We didn't.
It was actually her idea.
Wow, that's not good.
No.
No, that's not good at all.
Everything's taken care of.
I'm guessing you're going to want this back.
But your pretty little outfit is going to need a good dry-clean.
You're gonna have to get her out of here before Jenna gets home.
Is that all you have to say to me? This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I don't much like you, either, if we're going to be open.
And frankly, I'd be happy to see you dead but if we're going to try to take on Klaus, we kind of need you to be alive.
So I'm not a threat to you, Elena.
If any of you are going to believe anything, believe that.
Thanks for getting me home.
That was kind of crazy.
Jenna, are you going to be okay? Look, Isobel is dead.
And there things about her death that I can't tell you.
That aren't for me to tell.
You can be upset and hate me.
I get it.
But just know that I love you.
At least I can tell you that much.
Good night, Ric.
Good night.
Hey.
You made it home.
Tonight was very weird.
Tell me about it.
- I'm worried about you.
- Don't be.
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.
The witch that could give you your powers back is dead and I think you have a serious case of denial going and I want you to know that I'm here for you no matter what, and I'm not Not that denial's the worst thing.
- Did you? - Shh.
When he grabbed me he gave me my powers back.
And something else.
Jonas wants me to kill Klaus.
And did he include a how? Yeah.
He did.
- You know what I can't figure out? - What's that? How the town knew Emily Bennett was a witch.
I mean, because according to Johnathan Gilbert he was the only one who knew.
I know he didn't turn her in.
Mm, I should have figured as much.
She was a loose end.
I like mine tied up.
- You know what I can't figure out? - Do I care? Why you won't tell me where to find the site of the witch massacre.
Because I have no clue.
You knew Emily Bennett was key to getting me out of the tomb.
Something tells me you did everything in your power to make sure that she was safe yet you have no idea where she was killed.
Who's the liar now? - You hurt me today.
- Tit for tat.
You were mean.
And very rough.
And monstrous.
You deserved it.
- I like this Damon.
- Katherine.
Katherine, there are six other bedrooms in this house.
Go find one.
Hi.
What the hell? Your face and all the blood.
L I drank your blood.
You were dying.
My blood healed you.
What do you mean, it healed me? How can your blood heal me? Because that's what vampire blood does for humans and that's what I am.
I'm a vampire, Matt.
- No.
- But it's all gonna be okay.
I'll tell you everything and you'll understand why I kept it from you - and we're gonna be fine.
- We'll be fine? Yes, because we're together and we love each other.
Vampires.
Oh, my God.
Vickie, at the hospital, I thought that she was tripping out.
- What? - Vickie, she knew about the vampires and I What did you do? - Nothing.
Nothing.
Matt.
- I need to get out of here.
No, no, no.
I can't let you leave.
- Okay, not like this.
- What did you do to my sister? Nothing.
I swear, I swear, nothing, nothing.
- What did you do? - Nothing.
You have to calm down.
Matt.
Are John and Jeremy asleep? I think so.
If I go to bed right now there's a chance I'll wake up hangover-free.
Who's that? Hi.
You must be Jenna.
I'm Elena's mother.
Isobel.
