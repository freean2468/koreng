Previously on The Vampire Diaries: Vampires and werewolves used to roam until a shaman put a curse on them.
Werewolves can only turn on a full moon and vampires are weakened by the sun.
You're saying, the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me? Klaus is the most feared of the Originals, but I'm here to offer you a deal.
You trust Elijah? He's an Original.
He can't be trusted.
Elena told me you're both working for Elijah.
So don't lie about it.
- I'm Jules.
I know you're a werewolf.
- Do you know where Mason is? - He's dead.
- I don't know who to trust.
You stood there when they were going to kill us? You stood there.
You didn't do anything.
- I didn't know what to do.
- It's too late.
Because we're not friends anymore.
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm not afraid of a vampire.
- We will take you.
- I'm not so sure about that, tough guy.
Elijah made a promise to Elena.
I'm here to see it's upheld.
I don't know what Mason was doing here.
Because of this rock he was trying to find.
- What rock? - A moonstone.
- Where is it now? - I couldn't tell you.
Go ahead, tell her.
Let me just preface this with a big disclaimer that screams: - "I should have known better.
" - What is it, Stevie? When Brady told me what Tyler said about Mason being here for the moonstone something clicked.
There was this moment back in Florida when I suspected Mason was up to something.
He was banging that hot vampire, Kathy, and he didn't want anyone to know.
- All right.
Just get to the point.
- That is the point, Jules.
It's the sun and moon curse.
Mason was asking me all kinds of questions about it.
If it could be broken.
And when that evil man-witch showed up last night, double-click.
Witches, vampires, moonstone.
They're putting everything in place to break the curse.
We can't let them do that even if we have to kill every last vampire in this town.
- Go away.
- Mm.
- Hello? - Unh.
- Elena.
- Shh.
How was the slumber party? Unh.
Good.
Heh, much needed.
- When can you and I have one? - Mm.
That can be arranged.
Okay.
Now.
Today.
Take me far, far away.
- Even with everything that's going on? - Because of everything that's going on.
And you're sure this has nothing to do with dodging your father who just got into town? Uh, heh This has everything to do with that.
Well, in that case, where would you like to go? I'm late.
This is such a crazy day.
I'm, uh, covering the Historical Society's high tea.
Woo-hoo! Thrilling.
Yeah, it's for some visiting writer.
He's writing a book on small-town Virginia.
It's a big snooze, heh.
- Writer? What's his name? - Mm-hm.
Uh, Elijah Smith.
- Smith.
He's using Smith? - Mm-hm.
Heh.
Okay.
You have your story straight in your mind, right? I can't say that you bit me or drank my blood just that we hit it off and I really like you.
You are terrific, though.
You're sweet, funny, you're honest.
And you're falling hard.
You might be the one.
Perfect.
- Have a great day, honey.
- Mwah.
Oh, hey, Alaric, heh.
Later.
My new girlfriend.
- Andie Starr, Action News.
- It's not called Action News.
Yeah, I know.
I just like saying it.
Come on.
So John Gilbert gave me this to kill Elijah.
Said you have to dip the dagger in the remains of an ash tree that dates back to the Originals.
If there's any truth in that.
- You think it's a set-up? - Could be.
Guy's a weasel.
Wouldn't put anything past him.
What are you up to today? Jenna and I are supposed to go to her lake house but somehow we both got roped into doing this Historical Society thing at the Lockwoods'.
Where Elijah's the guest of honor.
- You're not gonna kill him at the party.
- No, heh, that would be stupid.
I wanna know his endgame before I kill him.
But I do think it's time Elijah and I officially met.
Okay, so tell me about this big witchy plan you've been cooking up.
We don't know the extent of what Elijah's up to.
No, we don't.
- I ask Luka to tell me what he knows.
- He's not gonna tell you anything.
I didn't say he was gonna have a choice.
What? What's that about? I don't know.
I thought that we were I don't know.
Tyler.
Hi.
- Still here.
- Is that all right with you? That guy made it clear you needed to go.
And we will.
Soon.
Listen, we kind of need your help with something.
Help us find the moonstone.
Explain to me what the big deal is about a rock.
That rock helps break the curse of the sun and the moon.
I don't know what that means.
It's an old curse placed on both vampires and werewolves.
Vampires break the curse, they're free to walk in sunlight but we're stuck only turning at the full moon, a.
k.
a.
Werewolf armageddon.
If we break it, they're stuck and we can turn whenever we want.
A.
k.
a.
Werewolf domination.
Tyler, if we can turn at will, that means we never have to turn at all.
Not if we don't want to.
- I'd never have to turn again? - There's more.
Stevie? If vamps are gearing up to break the curse - they have found the doppelganger.
- The doppelganger? Evil-twin shadow person.
We're betting Mason's chick Kathy knows all about it so we need you to help us find Kathy.
I have, uh, a picture.
Mason brought her to the bar once.
No one liked her.
She was a vampire.
Bad news.
Right here.
The girl next to Mason.
That's Elena Gilbert.
You know her? I've known her my whole life.
Hi.
I'm working.
Yeah, I can see that, but can you work and talk? What do you want? I wanna talk about what we were supposed to talk about last night before I had to cancel on you.
Yeah, I want us to clear up the weirdness.
I just want us to talk about us.
Now you're just making it worse.
Uh, I, heh I don't know what's going on, Matt.
Where were you last night when you were supposed to be with me? - Uh, l - Don't say you were with Bonnie because Bonnie was here.
I saw her.
Oh.
Yeah.
Matt? Caroline.
- You stay away from me.
- Look, it's important.
Just stop it, Tyler, okay? You're just making it worse.
I'm sorry about what happened but there's so much we need to talk about.
I said, just leave me alone.
Two of you wanna get together, fine.
There's nothing I can do about it but do me a favor, stop lying about it.
- Matt, there's nothing going on.
- Hey.
I said, stop lying.
- Ready for our romantic weekend? - Heh, beyond ready.
Let's go before John shows up and pretends to be a concerned father.
Hmm, I'll go put these in the car.
Uh, please tell me there's nothing wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Just Caroline.
Come on.
Let's go.
She's going to Dunham Lake.
Her family has a house up there.
Nice.
Let's go get our doppelganger.
You all right? I'm good.
I just haven't been back here since before.
Oh, my God.
Elena, listen, just say the word, all right? We'll get back on that highway, we'll go anywhere else.
I've always loved it here.
I want it to stay that way.
I was just having a moment.
You don't have to wait there.
I'm all good.
Oh, that's great because I'm, uh I'm stuck.
Oh, my God.
You can't get in.
Not gonna be a very romantic weekend unless you, uh, invite me inside.
- Stefan, I can't.
- What? My parents left this place to John Gilbert.
He's the only one who can invite you in.
I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.
You're kidding me, right? Stefan Salvatore, I hereby invite you into this home, heh.
You are such a liar.
Heh, hey.
Hey.
Hey.
You spent much time in Richmond for your book? There's such a wealth of history there.
No.
I'm focusing mostly on the, uh, smaller regions of Virginia.
- Lots of research.
Strictly academic.
- That's fascinating.
Damon? What are you doing here? Hi.
You came.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Thanks for introducing us, Jenna.
- Heh.
Wow.
- Damon, what a surprise.
- Carol.
Hi.
Hi.
Elijah, I want you to meet Damon Salvatore.
His family is one of Mystic Falls' founding families.
Mm-hm.
- Such a pleasure to meet you.
- No, pleasure's mine.
Come bearing coffee gifts.
So you're talking to me now.
I found out what your dad did, saving my friends from the wolf pack.
Well, had I known that's all it took.
- Hey, how's it going? - What are you doing here? Bonnie called, I wanted to help.
How's it going? She's selling it and he's buying it.
- She's giving him the sex smile.
- Yeah, all right, Caroline.
I get it.
What you say? Wanna play a game? - Yeah.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
- Okay.
What's happening to me? You're gonna be okay.
Ooh.
Why don't we go over here? I got him, I got him.
What kind of witch roofie was that? A strong one.
Having another moment? Jeremy broke his arm diving off this dock when he was 6.
My dad taught me how to fish right off the edge over there.
So many memories.
Do you ever think about us? What our future will be like, our memories? I think there are a lot of conversations to be had about our future about the kind of life we could have together.
Now, there's a box that we shouldn't open.
Oh, we can open it.
Whenever you're ready.
No.
I'd rather just be here.
Now.
You know, this is a future memory.
It's where your boyfriend whispered to you that he loved you.
I love you.
What's Damon doing with Elijah? - How would I know? - Because you're his little helper.
If you say so, John.
Does Jenna know about your extracurricular activities? Maybe it's time we tell her.
I mean, she can't stay in the dark forever.
You're a dick.
I don't think - you should sleep over anymore.
- Mm? It's inappropriate with children in the house.
And that ring that Isobel gave you? That's mine.
I'm gonna want that back.
Hmm.
- What can I do for you, Damon? - I was hoping we could have a word.
- Where is Elena? - Safe with Stefan.
They're laying low.
You know, bit of a werewolf problem.
Oh, yeah.
I heard about that.
I'm sure, since it was your witch that saved the day.
- You are welcome.
- Which adds to my confusion of exactly why you're here.
Why don't you just stay focused on keeping Elena safe and leave the rest to me.
Not good enough.
You young vampires, you're so arrogant.
How dare you come in here and challenge me? You can't kill me, man.
It's not part of the deal.
Silence.
I'm an Original.
Show a little respect.
The moment you cease to be of use to me, you're dead so you should do what I say.
Keep Elena safe.
My dad did all the cooking too.
- And your mom? - She sat right here - and watched.
- Heh.
She couldn't cook either.
Fire's dying.
Oh, yeah.
I will get more wood.
- I got it.
- No, no.
It's cold outside.
Hey.
So I'll get a jacket.
My mom's perfume.
Jenna was supposed to pack all this up but she kept putting it off.
I don't blame her.
Here.
Bundle up.
It was my great-granddad's.
And you look very hot in it.
I look hot in your dead great-granddad's jacket? Beyond hot, heh.
Stefan.
It's my parents' bedroom.
- Mm.
- Heh.
Heh, what? - Huh? - What? This is hollow inside.
What is it? A really good hiding place.
Oh, my God.
We only have an hour or two before my mom gets home and these are all I could find.
Place these evenly around the room.
How does this work? Um, I'll put him in a trance and ask him questions.
It's It's like hypnosis.
- You sure you're strong enough for this? - That's what the candles are for.
- I'll draw power from the flames.
- I'll get the matches.
I got it.
Never gonna get used to that.
Oh, come on.
That's pretty hot and you know it.
- I need a bowl of water.
- Yeah, yeah.
I'II, uh, go get it.
Okay, what was that? It's hot? He is so crushing on you.
- So? - So? What, you'd rather be with traitor warlock over here? I'm not into Luka.
It's just you know, he understood me and he was new and different.
And you've known Jeremy since forever and you only see him one way, as Elena's brother.
But you're a witch and I'm a vampire.
You know, it's not like we're in any position to - To be picky.
- No.
To judge.
Looks like he's waking up.
- Today was a bust.
- Yeah.
- How's the throat? - Sore.
Yeah, that Elijah's one scary dude.
But with nice hair.
Hey, you want another one? Ugh, he's gonna be hard to kill.
Yeah.
I'd think twice before I'd trust that dagger and some ashes to do the job.
- You're gonna need more info.
- I'm out of sources.
What's up with you and this news chick? Ooh.
She's got spunk, huh? - Just don't kill her, please.
- Lf I did, who would report her death? Just don't do it, all right? She's friends with Jenna and it's bad enough I'm lying about everything.
I hate the lies.
Oh, God.
I gotta go.
I gotta pick Jenna up.
Don't worry.
I'II, uh, show myself out.
Good luck.
Whew.
Damn, you're strong.
It took the whole syringe.
Grab that one.
He's dead.
Hi, Damon.
Nice to see you again.
These must be the other Johnathan Gilbert journals.
Jeremy had the one but John said that there were others.
His whole life's in here.
I'll go get the firewood.
Let you have a moment.
We're good to go.
You up for this? These people have done nothing but lie to you.
This girl that you've known since birth, she's with the vampires now the ones who killed Mason.
They're the enemy and if they break that curse well, all of us are as good as dead.
Are you up for this? - Yes.
- Good.
Because if you wuss out, you're gonna have me to deal with, you got it? - Where's Elena? - At the lake house for the weekend.
- With Stefan.
- Yes, with Stefan.
- Who gave her permission for that? - I did.
Until you get a lawyer file for guardianship, it's my call, there's nothing you can do.
I always knew you were lax with them but I didn't think you were negligent.
She wanted to get away from you, okay? And so do I, so I'll be staying with Ric.
Because he's such a great guy, right? You are on dangerous ground.
- He's a liar, Jenna.
- What? Did he tell you what happened to his wife? - She died.
- Really? So they found her body? What are you saying? Why don't you ask Ric? I'd love to hear his answer.
Have a great night.
- Morning, sunshine.
- Oh.
I saw this movie once, some torture-porn flick.
Anyway, they had this collar device that was, heh, really cool so I just modified it some with some wooden nails, and when I pull So I hear you have the moonstone.
Oh, if you only knew the irony of this moment right now.
Let me tell you how this is gonna go.
You're gonna torture me, I don't talk, someone loses a heart.
Last time, it was your boy Mason.
This time, it'll be you.
- How long is this gonna take? - I don't know.
He's fighting me.
Please stop.
Please.
Yeah.
All right.
Why are you working with Elijah? Klaus.
We both want him dead.
You wanna kill Klaus too.
Why? Because he has her and we have to get her away from him.
- Who are you talking about? - My sister.
His sister? Why does he have her? He's searching for a way to undo the curse without the doppelganger.
He's forced generations of witches to help him for centuries.
What has Elijah promised you? If we help Elijah kill Klaus, he's promised to return her to us.
And how do you kill Klaus? How do you kill an Original vampire? He'll kill me if I tell you.
Don't make me.
It's okay, Bonnie, we can find another way.
No.
How will you kill Klaus? After the sacrifice, Klaus will be vulnerable, weak.
It's our only chance.
After the sacrifice? What do you mean "after"? Klaus will be vulnerable.
But Elena will be dead.
Yes.
Elena has to die.
No.
Keep him down.
If he moves kill him.
Don't move.
Help me get the bullet out.
It punctured my heart.
I need to get it out.
I'm not gonna fight you.
I don't think so.
Tyler, why are you doing this? I can't let you break the curse.
- You know about the curse? - You're liars, all of you.
No, I swear to you.
We don't wanna break the curse.
We don't wanna do that.
Oh, yeah? But I do.
I can't be like this forever.
Tyler, I'm just trying to save Elena.
Elena will be fine.
They didn't tell you that part, did they? - Who are the liars now? - Tell me what? In order to break the curse, Elena has to die.
Are you growing the trees out there? Stefan? Stefan, what are you doing out there? I can smell you.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
It's okay.
Tyler? I didn't know what they were gonna do to you.
I didn't.
I just I don't wanna be like this anymore.
I'm sorry, Elena.
It's okay.
You know what the great thing about buckshot is? It scatters through the body.
Maximum damage.
- Where's the moonstone? - Get over it, honey.
You're never gonna get it.
You looking for this? Go ahead.
Take it.
What about you, sweetheart, huh? Wanna take a shot? No? Yes? No? Where's the girl? I don't know.
It doesn't really matter.
So you realize this is the third time I've saved your life now? So he planned to kill her all along.
Yeah, the sacrifice is part of Elijah's plan.
Got it.
Loud and clear.
- Finally.
- Unh.
You missed all the fun.
There you are.
Are you okay? ALARIC Yeah, sorry.
Er, I've just been grading papers.
Honestly Uh I fell asleep.
I'm sorry.
Jenna, I'm a jerk.
No, it's fine.
I'm just glad you're okay.
So, uh, tomorrow, I'm all yours, okay? Sure.
Sounds great.
- All right.
Good night, Jenna.
- Good night.
It was straight from the witch's mouth.
He was gonna go through with the whole sacrifice.
You should keep her away a little longer.
- Be careful, try not to get yourself killed.
- Yeah, it's been a day for that.
It was, um That was Damon.
- We need to talk.
- What is it? He learned that Elijah's planning for you to die in the sacrifice ritual.
I know the deal I made, Stefan.
Elijah's very careful with his words.
He promised to protect my friends.
He never said a word about me.
You mean that you knew that you weren't gonna survive this? If it comes down to the people that I love getting killed or me I know what my choice is gonna be.
Elena, how? How could you stand out there earlier with me talking about our future when you don't even expect to have one.
I'm sorry, Stefan.
I'm just trying to keep the people that I love safe.
I'm trying to keep you safe.
No, what you're doing is you're being a martyr.
How is that any different from when you say that you would die to keep me safe? Because I've already lived.
A hundred and sixty-two years I have lived and you've barely begun.
And now you wanna let yourself get killed? That's not heroic.
It's tragic.
So will Luka remember anything? No.
He'll know he lost consciousness, that's all.
Well, should we wait for Caroline? She was just gonna drop Luka back at the Grill.
Said to lock the door on our way out.
Yeah, well, I hope she drops him hard.
Wait.
You're Elena's little brother, I've known you forever.
You're that punk kid.
I remember your awkward, heh, phase and then your emo phase - your druggie phase and - Heh.
overnight, you turned into this hot guy who's really sweet and You think I'm hot? With everything that's going on, you know, the curses and sacrifice Enough already.
Wow.
Hello? Hello? Matt.
- I'm not in the mood, man.
- I need to say something.
All right.
Say it.
I've been going through a rough time, something I can't really talk about and Caroline's been helping me through it.
She's been there for me more than anyone's ever been there my entire life and I kind of fell for her.
I don't know how anyone wouldn't because she's pretty incredible.
But she loves you and she needs you and to be honest she deserves someone like you.
So you be good to her okay? Yeah, man.
Of course.
See you around, Matt.
Yeah.
Mom? I'm sorry about Brady and your friends but if I'm gonna go with you no more lies.
No more lies.
You're doing the right thing.
I can't stay here not like this.
