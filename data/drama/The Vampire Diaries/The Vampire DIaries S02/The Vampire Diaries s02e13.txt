- Previously on Vampire Diaries: - Vampires and werewolves roamed free until a shaman put a curse on them.
Werewolves can only turn on a full moon, vampires are weakened by the sun.
- Elijah.
- One of the Originals.
- A legend.
- Klaus is the real deal.
You're saying the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me? - I offer you a deal.
- What kind of deal? Stay put and stop trying to get killed.
Your friends remain unharmed.
- I called Isobel.
- Did you find her? Not exactly.
- Hello, Elena.
- Uncle John.
A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire, so don't be his friend.
You understand? I'm Jules.
I know you're a werewolf.
- Do you know where Mason is? - He's dead.
You wanna know who murdered him? Your blond vampire did.
- Caroline would never do that.
- She and her friends were behind it.
Hey.
How's it going? We need to talk.
Yeah, we do.
Listen, I've been thinking about it, and I don't wanna overanalyze.
Yeah, it was just one kiss but Matt's still kind of in the picture.
We can't go there, Tyler.
Fine.
Great.
That's settled.
What happened to my Uncle Mason? - What? - He's dead.
And I want you to tell me what happened.
- Uh, Tyler, I don't - Then let me tell you.
Stefan and his brother Damon killed him because Stefan and Damon are vampires just like you.
- Who told you that? - Is it true? Let me explain.
Did you know he was dead this whole time? - Please.
- Did you know? - I'm sorry, Tyler.
I'm sorry.
- I trusted you.
ANDIE The sheriff's department believes drugs played a part in the assailant's deranged and violent behavior that left three dead at last night's Booster Club dinner at a high school.
Authorities believe last night's assailant may be linked to the missing campers and park ranger who have yet to be found as well as Jessica Koenig, reported missing this morning.
The sheriff's department says investigations are pending and no further comment will be made.
In related news, Mayor Lockwood spoke earlier today.
CAROL Due to the recent tragedies that have plagued our town we will be holding a memorial in Town Square to honor all we have lost.
Join us in hopes that, as a community, we can begin to heal.
- Morning.
- What are you doing here? - Coffee? - We're not doing that.
We did that last night.
No more avoiding.
Why are you here? I'm here to protect you.
That's all I can say for the moment.
- What do you mean that's all? - I'll tell you more when I can trust you.
Oh, God, I'm late.
- That's what you get for hitting snooze.
- What the hell? Good morning to you, Jenna, Alaric.
It's okay I'm confused, right? Because we were not expecting you, like, ever.
Well, I got in late last night.
Elena let me in.
You know, I'm, uh, probably just gonna take off.
I'm still confused here.
- I decided to come back and stay a while.
- Not here.
Actually, you can't stop me from living here.
Actually, I can.
As legal guardian.
Yeah, about that.
Um, you want me to explain the situation - or would you like to do the honors? - What's going on? I'm sorry, Jenna.
I should have told you earlier but I'm Elena's biological father.
There.
Now you know.
What? You brought back John Gilbert? - That was your big "save Elena" move? - I went to look for Isobel and got John.
He said he could help us and we're desperate.
We're not that desperate.
The guy tried to barbecue me.
Damon, Bonnie's witch friend is working with Elijah.
We have to assume the moonstone was never destroyed.
Elena is putting all of her faith into some deal that she made with Elijah to keep everyone safe.
Do you trust Elijah? I don't trust him.
He's an Original.
He can't be trusted.
It's not like we could go and kill him because apparently he can't die.
Waiting for the part where John's the answer.
He knew about the sacrifice.
Isobel told him.
He said he knew of a way to keep Elena safe.
- And how do we do that? - He's not talking.
At least not to me, anyway.
Great work, Stefan, topnotch.
As if I didn't have enough problems.
Hey, I'm sorry about Rose.
Whatever.
I knew the woman for five minutes.
And you cared about her after five minutes.
Oh, I wonder what that means.
It means I care, Stefan.
It means I'm changing and evolving into a man capable of greatness.
Better watch your back because I may have to go get a hero hairdo of my own and steal your thunder.
I got it, Mom.
- What's wrong? - Tyler knows about you.
He knows that Damon killed Mason.
I didn't say a word.
It's that Jules.
She had a run-in with Damon.
Tyler was so upset.
The look on his face - he was so betrayed.
- Wow, this is bad.
- You're not gonna tell Damon? - No.
He wants to kill him.
He thinks all werewolves should die.
He's not wrong.
What if Tyler tries to retaliate? He has every right.
He can get killed.
We're not gonna let that happen.
We have to get to him and reason with him before he does something stupid.
You have to talk to him.
Just try to explain.
You know, you always know the right things to say.
Okay, he and I we're friends.
I was right, wasn't I? Your little vampire friend, she was lying.
What do you want? I want you to understand that a vampire will never be your friend.
It's our nature to be enemies.
- You know how stupid that sounds? - You need to leave here.
It's not safe.
I can't just run away with you.
I don't even know you.
My mom would freak.
- My life is here.
- Your old life.
Your new life is just beginning.
- You have so much to learn.
- Like what? How to survive.
You've triggered the curse, Tyler.
It's important you learn what it means to be a lycanthrope.
We live by a code of loyalty.
We take care of each other.
It's my duty and honor to help you.
Please let me.
- Where's John? - He's not here.
He left.
I don't know where he went.
He just blew in, announced to Jenna that he's my dad and then took off.
- That's public knowledge now? - Apparently.
- You okay? - Yeah.
Jenna's head is spinning but I'm okay.
- He say what he was doing here? - No.
Stefan thinks that he's telling the truth about wanting to help me.
- You believe him? - No, I don't believe him for a second.
I don't either.
- What are we gonna do? - Kill him.
- Damon.
- I'm joking.
Okay, I'm a little serious.
- Damon.
- I'm not gonna hurt him, Elena.
I'm the good guy now, remember? - What does that mean? - I'm gonna have a civil conversation with your father.
Wait, I'm coming with you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just wanna talk.
- Then why did you break in? - Would you have let me in? Tyler? - Shh.
Not a word.
- Tyler? I'm leaving for the memorial.
Brady? - This was a hard place to find.
- You told me to stay under the radar.
- Thanks for coming.
- You sure these vamps killed Mason? Positive.
We have to be careful.
I'm not afraid of a vampire.
I know, baby, but I want the boy more than I want vengeance.
I say, let's get both.
Maybe we're getting off on the wrong foot here.
What happened to Mason? Tyler, there's a lot for us to talk about.
I wouldn't do that.
Without a full moon, you're no match for me.
It's good to have you back, John.
We could really use you.
And the Council? What are they doing? Damon Salvatore is leading the council now.
Talk to him.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Jeremy.
There you are.
Looks like I slept through the homecoming.
You didn't miss much.
To say no one's happy to see me is an understatement.
Things are different now.
You can't come around and start with all this anti-vampire stuff.
I have no intention of doing that.
How's that ring been treating you? Look, if this is what you came for, just take it and go.
What kind of man would I be if I took that from you? - Wanna go grab some lunch? - I think I'll pass.
Hello, Bonnie.
I don't have anything to say to you, Dr.
Martin.
Or your son.
- You must be feeling confused about us.
- There's nothing confusing about it.
I trusted Luka and he betrayed me.
Elena told me you're both working for Elijah, so don't lie about it.
I won't.
But that doesn't mean we're not also looking out for you.
Spare me the witch-Ioyalty crap.
You might not wanna believe this, but Elijah is a man of his word.
You can trust he'll keep his end of the deal to keep you and your friends protected.
You're right.
I don't believe it.
Is there a problem here? Not at all.
- What was that about? - Just more lies.
I can't believe it.
Elena is my sister's husband's brother's daughter and her mother is my boyfriend's deceased wife.
- You can't make this stuff up.
- It's, uh, definitely a little overwhelming.
I can't believe that they kept it a secret.
How it is even possible to keep a secret like that? Hey, you two.
You think I can, um, join you? - Do you have to? - I guess I don't have to but might as well.
Look who's here.
We just need answers.
Please don't do anything stupid.
Yeah, but stupid's so much more fun.
Damon, I mean it.
All I'm asking is you try to keep it together.
Be the better man.
Okay then.
John, buddy.
- How have you been? - I've been all right, Damon.
It's good to see you.
Look, about Caroline, no matter what her flaws are when push comes to shove, you want that girl on your side.
She's your friend.
Stop being a dick to her.
I thought vampires hated werewolves.
That's some leftover idea from another time.
It doesn't have to be that way.
We go to the same school.
We have the same friends.
We keep the same secrets.
It's gonna work, Tyler.
I mean, it's your home.
It's my home too.
I want this to work.
Help.
Help.
Whose number was that, hmm? Damn it.
I'm trying to save your life.
Can't you see that? We have a problem.
So, John, rumor has it you know a lot and won't say anything.
How do I know you can be trusted, Damon? Originals can compel vampires.
And according to Stefan, that's why Katherine's in the tomb.
An Original has compelled her to stay there.
Because the vervain had left her system.
Stefan and I, on the other hand, are chock-full.
You guys are drinking vervain? It's an acquired taste.
I don't see that magical ring on your stitched finger.
So if you know something about Klaus, start talking or I will kill you in your sleep.
Now, is that any way to convince me that you and I are on the same side? First, I need to know that I can trust you, Damon that I can count on you.
Then we'll talk.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- I haven't seen you.
- I'm not avoiding you, I swear.
Yeah, you're avoiding me a little.
Okay, maybe a little.
Can we talk later? I'm heading to work right now but maybe after? - We'll clear up some of this weirdness? - Yeah.
Yeah.
I'd really like that.
- I'll just swing by when you're closing? - Sounds good.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Okay.
Excuse me.
- Caroline, right? - Yeah.
I'm looking for Tyler.
You haven't seen him, have you? No, not since earlier.
Sorry.
I know you're lying.
Really? How? Is that one of your little wolf tricks? Actually, it is.
Well, I have a trick too.
I see you got the bullet out.
That was nasty.
I got lots of wooden bullets, other toys.
It's gonna be a long night, sweet pea.
You wanna be friends, great.
We're friends.
- Will you go now? - I don't know what else to say to you.
I came back to this town because I wanted a life.
I wanted to exist where I could have friends and where I could build a family.
I have that here.
We can both have that.
Hey.
Everything okay? JULES That depends.
How badly do you wanna keep her alive? - Who is this? - Ask your brother.
Where is Tyler? Jules.
- Where's Caroline? - You made a mistake, Stefan.
I'm gonna give you a chance to fix it.
- Where is she? - Right here.
Want proof? He needs proof.
- What? - Hurt her again and you're dead.
I hurt her again and she's dead.
Bring Tyler to me.
The clearing by Wickery Falls.
You have 20 minutes until she dies.
So my friend wants to meet you.
- Damon Salvatore, this is - I know you.
The news lady.
Yeah, Andie Starr.
Nice to meet you.
And I wonder if you know Can I buy you a drink, Damon? My glass is all full, Andie.
Thank you.
We say goodbye in the pouring rain And I break down as you walk away You totally blew her off.
I'm steering clear of all women at the moment.
You didn't have to be rude.
Trust me, it's in the best interest of women everywhere.
But I could never find the words to say Stefan? What is it? - Why am I finding out about this now? - Stefan was worried you'd That I would what? I would kill him? That's what needs to happen.
No, Damon, not Tyler.
Do what you need to do to get Caroline back but leave Tyler out of it, okay? Why? He's a werewolf.
He needs to die.
I'm willing to kill.
It's a win-win.
Damon, please.
Okay, too many people are dead.
You need to stop doing that.
Doing what? Assuming that I'll play the good guy because it's you who's asking.
Be the better man, Damon.
- Do you mind? - What's going on? - Nothing.
- It doesn't look like nothing.
Well, guess what, John? Trust works both ways.
Get out.
We don't have time.
We need to get Caroline.
We don't need to.
I'll take care of it.
Ground your daughter.
Keep her here.
- I'm coming with you.
- No.
I'm with Damon on this.
- Mm-mm.
- No, stop.
You're not going anywhere.
Just tell me what's going on.
So how many vampires are there in this town anyway? - Don't know.
- Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me? - Why? - You're a vampire.
Why not? Sorry.
What was that? - Get me out! - Excuse me? What was that? Let me out! - Get it out of your system? - No.
- I'm just getting started.
- Brady, let's be smart about this.
I just want the boy.
It's our duty to help him.
It's who we are.
You wanna talk duty and honor? These are vampires.
They cross one of us, they cross all of us.
That's who we are.
- You're not leaving.
- You can't tell me what to do.
I can.
Wanna know why? Because I'm here to make sure you stay safe.
I've got that covered.
Are you talking about the deal that you made with Elijah? You really think he's gonna keep his promise to you? Putting your faith in him was a dumb move.
I should put my faith in you after everything you did to Stefan and Damon? We've had our differences, and I've made mistakes.
- But you and I? We're family.
- You don't get to use that word.
That word is off-limits to you.
Fine, but it doesn't change the facts.
You're right.
Facts are facts, so listen up.
You may be my father, but I'm never going to be your daughter.
You ain't taking that from me - Oh, oh, no - You ain't taking that I know you're out there.
Where's Caroline? Locked up tight.
Let her go and I'll release Tyler.
Doesn't have to get any messier than it already has.
I'm not your enemy, Jules.
It's a little late to be waving a white flag, don't you think? You need to leave town.
No one else has to get hurt.
I'm not leaving without Tyler.
Tyler's free to make his own decisions, as soon as you release Caroline.
My brother the peacemaker.
Since Stefan got here before me, I'll try his way before I resort to my way, which is a little bloodier.
So give us Caroline.
- Let go of Tyler.
- Give us Caroline.
Without a full moon, it's not an even fight and you know it.
We will take you.
I'm not so sure about that, tough guy.
Let's try this again.
Give us Tyler.
You heard her.
Go.
Get over there.
- Which one of you killed Mason? - Uh, that'd be me.
Boys, make sure that one suffers.
- We can take them.
- I don't know about that.
Well, then.
Tyler.
There's a latch.
There's a latch on the door and I can't get to it.
Tyler? Tyler, please.
Tyler? Come on.
What's happening? What the hell's going on? Elijah made a promise to Elena.
I'm here to see it's upheld.
You need to go.
Get out of here.
Now.
When your friends awaken, give them a message.
They need to get the hell out of this town.
- So is your mom home? - No, she's at work.
- I can come in if you want me to.
- I'm fine, Stefan.
You don't have to pretend with me.
Anybody would be upset after what you went through tonight.
I'm okay.
I'm not girly little Caroline anymore.
I can handle myself.
Sure you can.
I just really wanna go shower, so Okay.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- What do you want? - We didn't finish our conversation.
I'll bite.
I've been thinking.
Personal feelings aside, Damon I think you and Stefan will do all you can to protect Elena.
- I agree with that statement.
- So I come bearing gifts.
- What the hell is that? - This is how you kill an Original.
In this vial is ash from a white oak tree that dates back to the genesis of the Originals.
The dagger must be dipped into the ash and then plunged into their heart.
- How do you know all this, John? - Isobel.
She's very good at finding out things.
- But, of course, you know that.
- Where is Isobel? Let's just say if she accomplishes what she's attempting Klaus will never set foot in Mystic Falls.
Where Elena's concerned, you and I are on the same side.
- Hi.
- Hey, did something happen? Oh, my I am so sorry, Matt.
- Are you okay? - Yeah.
Something came up with Bonnie and she needed me.
A friend thing.
You understand? Yeah.
Uh, so are you with her right now? Yeah.
So I'm not gonna make it tonight, Matt.
- But can I see you tomorrow? - Yeah.
Sure.
I hope everything works out.
Good night.
Good night.
Are you okay? - I'm fine.
- I had no idea they would come for you.
Do you know what they did to me? I'm sorry.
But it's crazy now.
Okay? I don't know who to trust.
- You lied to me.
- I lied to protect my friends.
I lied to protect you.
Don't you get that? - Caroline - You just stood there.
When they were gonna kill us? You stood there.
- Didn't do anything.
- I didn't know what to do.
You help your friend.
That's what you do.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's too late.
We're not friends anymore.
And what happened to me tonight, that will never happen again.
So you take that back to your werewolf pack and you get the hell out of my house.
- I'm sorry about earlier.
- Enough already.
I don't want you here and I can't make that any more clear.
I didn't come here to fight with you, Elena.
Yeah, I know.
You're here to protect me.
Got it.
Get in line.
I thought you might want this.
It was your mother's.
- Isobel? - No.
Your mother, Miranda.
I remember her wearing it when she was young.
I found it in a box with some things that your dad left me.
Here.
It's yours now.
Miranda and Grayson were your parents, Elena.
And I know I'm nothing to you.
You have no reason to believe me or trust me.
I've done so many horrible things.
But when you lost your parents, I lost my brother.
My family.
I lost my way.
I'm never going to make things right with you, I know that but I'm gonna do everything I can to protect you and protect this family.
Elena? - Are you okay? - I'm fine.
Did you hear that? I don't believe him, Stefan.
I just don't.
What happened tonight? How's Caroline? I could use your help.
Hey, come on in.
I'm sorry about your friends.
It's not always like this.
- Is it? - No.
- Is it, Brady? - No, man.
You're living in vampire country, that's all.
It's way better than this.
Mason didn't tell me anything about it.
He was gone.
Dead, I guess, before he could help me.
I don't get what Mason was even doing here in the first place.
His brother died, you know that.
But why was he stupid enough to stay and get himself killed? Because of this rock he was trying to find.
- What rock? - A moonstone.
- I had no idea.
- What? Moonstone.
- Did he find it? - Yeah.
Where is it now? I couldn't tell you.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- What's going on? - I was a bit worried about you.
After everything you went through tonight.
I'm fine.
Well, good.
But just in case, I, uh, brought some backup.
We're gonna slumber it.
We haven't done it in ages.
Hi.
I love you.
I love you.
I can't believe you called me.
Thought I was being way too forward when I had Jenna give you my number.
I like a woman who knows what she wants.
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm.
So, what do you want, Mr.
Tall-Dark-And-Handsome? I'm not that tall.
I need a distraction.
You can booty call me anytime you want.
See, the thing is, Miss Sexy-Reporter-Girl I have a problem I need help with.
It's really messing with my mind.
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm in love with a woman I can never have.
I knew it.
I know how to pick them.
So why can't you have her? She's with another man, I assume? Yeah.
That's not the point.
The point is I'm in love with her and l It's driving me crazy, I'm not in control.
What, you don't trust yourself around her? I don't trust myself around anyone, Andie.
I'm bad, Andie.
I do things.
Ooh.
I kill people.
Don't be afraid.
You're okay.
Why do you kill people? Because I like it.
It's in my nature.
It's who I am.
But then I have to protect her.
And she wants me to be the better man, which means I can't be who I am.
Do you see the problem I'm having, Andie? Well, maybe this is who you are now.
Love does that, Damon.
It changes us.
Just stop talking.
Just kiss me.
Be my distraction.
I know you were expecting someone else.
I sent Stefan to find Isobel.
She got your message.
She was busy so she sent me instead.
Does Stefan know that you're here right now? No.
No one does.
This is between you, me and Isobel.
I want out of this tomb, John.
I'm already on it.
