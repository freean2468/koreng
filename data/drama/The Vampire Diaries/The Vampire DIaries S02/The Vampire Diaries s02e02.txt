Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
- What are you? - I'm a vampire.
- That noise.
- What noise? - Aah! - Tyler! What the hell? - Caroline! - I can give Caroline some blood.
No.
No way.
- Enough to heal.
- Do it.
- So the black sheep returns.
- Tyler? Who's the guy with Carol? Mayor's younger brother, Mason Lockwood.
Damon.
Damon, I care about you.
I do.
But I love Stefan.
- Elena, what's going on in here? - No! Damon! Damon! No, no, no.
- Why do I look like Katherine? - You are not Katherine.
You're the opposite of everything she was.
- Elena, what are you doing here? - My name is Katherine.
I was hoping you could give the Salvatore brothers a message for me.
Game on.
What? Excuse me.
Where is everyone? - It's the middle of the night, hon.
- It is? - Mm-hm.
- Well, have you seen my mom? She left after dinner with your boyfriend.
- And then your friend Elena stopped by.
- She did? Yeah, she did.
But she said her name was Katherine.
- Can I just get something to eat? - Breakfast comes around 7:00.
- But I'm hungry.
- You should go back to sleep.
- What is that smell? - Back to bed.
What are you doing in here? I don't know.
You need to get back to bed.
Need another hand over here.
I mean, Katherine looked just like you.
It was freakish.
She is my ancestor.
I moved the student booths into the cafeteria.
Your vampire ancestor.
And she didn't just resemble you like a family member would.
She was you.
I don't know.
I can't explain it, okay? It's creepy.
That's all I got.
How do you know she's not out there pretending to be you.
I don't.
But I could sit here and be tortured by the not knowing or I could get these prizes to the ring toss.
Have you talked to Damon since he killed Jeremy? - Or tried to kill Jeremy? - No, Bonnie, I haven't.
I won't and I don't wanna talk about Damon or anything vampire-related.
Copy that.
I'm human.
And I have to do human stuff, otherwise I'm gonna go crazy.
Okay.
I'm sorry, I'll focus.
We have to make Caroline proud.
Or she will kill us.
- I don't know how she does this.
- Because she's not human, obviously.
Obviously, heh.
It's the same as the bracelet Elena gave you.
- So it protects me from compulsion? - Vervain is toxic to vampires.
You mean, like, poison? Yeah.
It's very poisonous.
It'll keep them out of your head.
But why vervain? I don't know.
There's certain natural herbs and roots and other elements that are harmful to vampires.
- Like a stake through the heart? - Right, but it has to be wood.
You're pretty confident telling me all the different ways I could kill you.
If I thought you wanted to kill me, we'd be having a different conversation.
And Damon is the one that deserves it.
I want you to forget about Damon.
He's a hundred times stronger than you and he's not stable.
You gotta try to move forward.
I was killed by a vampire and brought back by a magic ring.
How do you move forward from that? Today, we have a nice distraction courtesy of the slave driver Elena.
- Hello, Elena.
- Hey, um, Jeremy Yeah, yeah, I set up the goldfish toss.
All 300 goldfish.
It's gonna be epic.
Yeah.
He's gonna be all right.
He's just been through a little bit of an ordeal.
I was hoping this carnival would reel him back into the land of high school teenager.
- Oh, is that what we're doing here? - Yes, we all are.
We're gonna be boring students who live in a world - where the V-word is not uttered.
- Got it.
Then later, you're gonna take me to the Ferris wheel.
We're gonna ride to the top, you're gonna kiss me.
And my heart will flutter like a normal girl.
- Do you see a running theme here? - Yeah.
I'm seeing it.
I'm liking it.
But I have a quick question.
- Um, what do we do about Damon? - Uh, no D-word, okay? That has been deleted from the list of topics that we can discuss.
Unfortunately, Katherine showing up has him in a little bit of an odd place.
A little off-kilter.
Kind of dangerous.
Who knows what he's up to.
So I understand John Gilbert has left town.
Have they found the vampire that attacked him? Sheriff asked me to take the lead on that.
And I promise you, I will get to the bottom of it.
Which brings me to my next subject.
With Richard gone, I'll be acting as interim mayor until the elections.
And I'm going to need someone to spearhead the Council.
Hmm.
I'd like that person to be you.
Whatever you need, Carol.
As a founding family member, it's something that's close to me so I would be honored to help keep this town safe from vampires.
Oh, jeez.
Is it safe to talk? It's my brother-in-law, Mason.
He's still visiting.
I just don't want him to hear us.
He didn't want any part of the Council when he lived here and I see no reason to bring him into it now.
What was that, like seven? Six.
I don't count the last one.
- You crawled it.
- What? Think Grandma Lockwood actually passed you.
In her walker.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Shoes off.
Mud.
My mom.
- Cool.
Yeah, yeah.
So all this anger and aggression you were talking about.
You notice the difference when you exercise? Dude, I played three varsity sports.
I work out four times a week and run three.
I'm gonna say no.
You have episodes? I mean, what happens exactly? Starts out normal.
I mean, I get angry.
Typically over nothing.
I'm an angry guy.
You know, it just amplifies and then I go off.
- You black out? - Yeah.
It's like I go blind with rage.
Is there a pattern? Like, once a month? Only at night? All I know is I lose myself.
You know? For that time, I become something else.
And I hate it.
More tea? Damon? Oh, yes, please.
Thank you, Carol.
- Your mom said you're not eating.
- It's gross.
It's hospital food.
It's supposed to be gross.
She also said you're getting released tomorrow morning.
Morning? I need to get out tonight.
No.
The carnival is gonna happen without you, Caroline.
I know it's hard for your neurotic personality to process - but Bonnie and Elena have it.
- I'm not neurotic.
Yeah, you are, but it's cute, so Look, it's not about the carnival.
Okay? It's just that this place is just really depressing.
- That's because you're sitting in dark.
- No, don't! - What the hell? - Just close it.
Please? - What's wrong with you? - Close it.
Okay.
I'll just come back later, okay? - Would you care for one? - No.
Thank you.
Not hungry.
Just ate.
Aren't you worried that one day all the forest animals are gonna band together and fight back? I mean, surely, they talk.
I'm just happy that's a blood bag and not a sorority girl supplying your dinner.
I like this.
You walking on eggshells around me because you think I'm gonna explode.
It's very suspenseful.
Is Elena worried too? I bet I'm your every conversation.
Have you heard from Katherine? I think the Lockwoods have a family secret.
The Gilbert device affected them but vervain didn't.
So they're not vampires.
They're something else.
Is this your new obsession? Oh, you'd rather some unknown supernatural element running rampant in our town.
Fine.
I'll drop it.
We haven't seen the last of Katherine.
You do know that, right? - We have no idea what she's up to.
- Pfft.
Sure, we do.
She came back to profess her undying, eternal love for you.
So I'm gonna let you deal with her.
Because I have more important things to do like explode.
Cheers.
That's pretty.
Yeah, my friend gave it to me.
What's wrong? You can't tell anyone.
You can't tell anyone! I can't tell anyone.
You'll do what I say? - I'll do what you say.
- Good.
Because I'm starving.
Ring toss is out of Bart and Homer dolls - and Team Jacob tees.
- Okay.
I'll grab some from Science Club.
We lost a speaker in the karaoke booth.
Hey, all good, Elena.
Take a beat, look around, this is a huge success.
You mean I can do more than just wreak vampire havoc? Go figure.
Hey, uh, Carter, right? You're with the carnival.
- That'd be me.
- Okay, great.
Wow.
What you need, beautiful? Ha, ha.
What do you know about karaoke speakers? Show me the problem.
Yeah, Bonnie, show him the problem.
- Okay.
Come on.
- Come on? - What are you doing? - Huh? Nothing.
Just killing time.
Waiting for you.
- You looking for something? What? - Yeah, actually.
You know where I could I find any family artifact stuff? - The heirlooms? - Heh, blow through trust fund already? Ha, ha, I did that when I was 22.
No, I'm just looking for this old piece of my mom's.
My dad gave it to her when they got married.
It's sentimental value.
Probably passed down to your dad.
Should be in the house somewhere.
- What's it look like? - It's a moonstone.
It's about the size of a hockey puck.
Old, ugly.
- Minimal monetary value.
- Hey, man, whatever.
- Um, ask my mom, I guess.
- Yeah, cool.
I'll do that.
- You ready? - Yeah.
Jeremy.
So good to see you alive.
Aren't you a little old for a school carnival? About 150 years too old.
You're pretty funny cracking jokes when I could blow the whole lid off this thing by telling someone what you really are.
So please tell me that that is not a threat.
Maybe it is.
Oh.
This is what we're not gonna do.
We're not gonna walk around like we're invincible when it's this easy for me to end you.
If you wanna tell people what I really am, go ahead and try.
I will shove this ring so far up your ass you'll really have something to choke on.
The doctor said I'm good as new.
He signed me out.
He said I didn't have to wait till morning.
So call me when you get this.
It's dark, thank God.
Um, I am so sorry about that.
Okay.
Now what's the story? - My husband likes to get kinky.
- Yes.
Good.
Okay, so I'm gonna take off.
I'm committee chair for the carnival.
I'm worried it's a complete disaster.
God bless Elena, but she does not understand the word "fabulous.
" Once again, I am so sorry about that and if you could just forget that I bit you that would be great because I'm going to.
Forget what? I don't know how that works, but it's brilliant.
Uh-huh.
You're lurking.
- I'm observing.
- More like obsessing.
He's got strength.
He's a triple-letter varsity athlete.
Of course he has strength.
You're reaching.
- I bet I can take you.
- Enter the uncle.
- Bring it on, surfer boy.
- This is ridiculous.
- Damn! - Is that it? All right.
He's the champ.
- Who wants to go next? - Hey, Stefan wants a go.
Yeah, sure.
I'II, uh, give it a shot, you know.
Go, Stef.
Get him, Stef.
My brother over there thinks I can beat you.
Your brother's wrong.
Come on.
- You didn't put in any effort at all.
- Yeah, actually I did.
Come with me.
- Is he? - It wasn't that kind of strength.
It was more than human, if that makes sense.
What is up with that family? If they're not vampires then what the hell are they? Ooh, uh, maybe they're ninja turtles? - You're not funny.
- Or, no.
Zombies.
Werewolves.
No comedic timing at all.
What? What are you up to? Since this is reality and there's no such thing as werewolves or combat turtles - It's a ninja turtle, actually.
- Hey, you.
- I have a name.
- Yeah, I don't care.
Wha? I need you to pick a fight with someone.
Kid named Tyler Lockwood.
- Damon, don't do this.
- It's just an experiment.
Get him mad.
But don't back down no matter what he does.
Okay? - I won't back down.
- I know you won't.
You realize somebody's gonna get hurt.
- Someone's gonna get mad.
As in rage.
- Why? What's that gonna accomplish? That Tyler kid is incapable of walking away from a fight.
Let's see who intervenes.
Maybe it's the ambiguously supernatural mystery uncle.
Oh, hey, blondie.
They let you out? I remember.
- What do you remember? - I remember how you manipulated me.
You pushed me around.
Abused me.
Erased my memories.
Fed on me.
You're crazy.
Well, the memories have been coming back.
In pieces.
You can't remember.
It's impossible.
I mean, unless you were becoming a I have a message from Katherine.
- She said, "Game on.
" - Wait.
You suck.
- Elena.
- What do you want, Damon? I'm the last person you wanna see, but I need you to come with me.
Whatever it is, I'm not interested.
I need you to come with me right now, Elena.
- Watch where you're going.
- You got a problem? Yeah, you walked right into me.
- What are you gonna do about it? - You're kidding, right? You better back off.
You hit me again, I swear to God Hey! Tyler.
Tyler! Hey! Hey, dude.
Get back.
What the hell, man? Your eyes.
Come on.
Gotta go.
You all right, man? Why did I just do that? You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
- What are you doing here? - They discharged me.
All better.
How do you feel? Heh, I feel pretty good.
- Because earlier, you were a little - I'm all better.
- All better.
Heh, heh.
- Okay.
- You wanna give it a shot? - Yeah.
Whoa.
Uh Hey, nice shot, killer.
Uh, they must've already been broken.
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong? - I gotta go.
- What? No, Care, wait.
Are you okay? Do you need to go back? No.
Just leave me alone.
How did this happen, hmm? I fed her blood and Katherine killed her.
- And A plus B equals - But why? Because Katherine is a manipulative, nasty little slut.
And she said, "Game on"? What does that even mean? It means she's playing dirty.
She wants us to know.
But why Caroline? - I don't know.
- Caroline must be out of her mind.
- She has no idea what's happening.
- Oh, I think she does.
All my compulsion started wearing off the minute she was in transition.
- We have to find her.
- Yep, and kill her.
- You're not gonna kill Caroline.
- She knows who we are.
- She's a liability.
We gotta get rid of her.
- Damon.
Absolutely not.
Need I remind you of a tragic little story of a girl named Vicki Donovan? Yeah.
Caroline will not make it as a vampire.
Her mother is a vampire hunter.
We all know how this story ends.
Let's just flip to the last chapter and It's not an option, Damon.
No? Your silence is deafening, Stefan.
Wait, wasn't there a school carnival the night you staked Vicki? Talk about a town where history repeats itself.
You know I'm right.
We're not gonna kill her.
It's the only way.
- Hey, is everything okay? - No.
- I'm so sorry.
- What? She's obviously pissed at me for something, but for what? No clue.
- Well, what happened? - She freaked out.
And she's been like that all day.
Cool one minute, and crazy neurotic the next.
She almost died.
It's bound to mess with her head.
- Plus, she's Caroline.
- Yeah.
I'm used to the insecurities and all that.
It's who she is, love it or hate it.
But this seemed, I don't know, different.
More.
L I can't explain it.
You agree with Damon, don't you? Stefan? - Stefan.
Hey.
- Damon's right.
Not about what we should do, but about what's gonna happen.
Katherine all but signed Caroline's death sentence.
Well, we can't let it end that way.
She's doing this to me, isn't she? Actually, she's doing it to me.
All right, we're home.
Safe territory.
Enough with the silence.
- Leave it alone.
- What was that move you pulled? Brazilian martial arts.
I took some classes a while back.
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying.
I saw something.
- You didn't see anything.
- I saw your eyes.
- They glowed.
- Reflection of a car headlight, maybe.
Reflection of a car headlight? You expect me to believe that? Tyler! Hey! You wanna know what you saw? You saw me get pissed off that I had to pull your delinquent ass out of a fight.
Where could she be? What is it? Do you hear her? What's going on, Stefan? What is it? Blood.
I can smell blood.
He's dead.
I killed him.
What's wrong with me? Hey.
Hey, it's okay.
- I can help you.
- You can? Yeah.
I have to.
- What are you going to do? - The only thing I can do.
I'm gonna kill you.
Please don't.
I don't want to die.
- Yeah, but you're already dead.
- No, I'm not.
Don't say that.
Okay? Just help me.
- Okay.
- Okay? Just help me.
- Please.
Please.
Please.
- Okay, okay, okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Gonna be okay.
It's the only way.
Stephan! Get away from me.
You killed me.
No, no, Caroline, that wasn't me.
That was Katherine.
No! Then why does she look like you? And why? Why did she do this to me? - We gotta get her inside.
- Caroline, come with me.
She will die.
It's only a matter of time.
Maybe so.
But it's not gonna happen tonight.
Oh, yeah, it is.
Damon, she's my friend.
Whatever happens, it's on you.
- Get her cleaned up.
- Caroline? - It's okay.
Come on.
- No.
You're not.
You can't.
You can't be.
Bonnie.
- Oh, God! - Bonnie.
- It's all right.
Come here.
- She hates me.
- No, no.
- Bonnie hates me.
No, no, no.
She's just in shock.
We all are, okay? And what about Matt? - What am I supposed to do about Matt? - Shh.
One thing at a time.
Let's just get this blood cleaned off.
I'm a murderer.
I'm a monster.
Your emotions are heightened right now.
It's part of transformation.
It's completely normal.
I promise you, okay? God! And why does this keep happening to my face? - I'm hideous.
- Caroline.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Caroline.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Look at my face.
Look at my face.
Shh, shh.
Look, look.
See it? You see that? Yeah? When you feel the blood rush, tell yourself you're gonna get through it.
That you're strong enough.
Yes.
No matter how good it feels to give yourself over to it you fight it off, you bury it.
Watch me.
Watch me.
That's the only way you're gonna survive this thing.
Try.
Shh.
Try.
That's good.
Why did Katherine do this to me? I don't know.
I wish I did.
Hey.
Hey.
I promise you, I will not let anything happen to you.
Come here.
Come here.
I can't believe this is happening.
Come on, don't pout about it.
You got a body to bury.
Thought you were calling the shots.
No? Sucks to be you, buddy.
I told you what would happen if anyone else got hurt.
- I didn't do this.
- Bonnie, it wasn't his fault.
Everything that happens is his fault, Elena.
Bonnie, what are you doing? Bonnie, stop it.
Bonnie.
Bonnie, stop it.
Bonnie, stop it.
You're gonna kill him.
Bonnie! Hey! Bonnie.
- Why? Why did you stop me? - Because this isn't us.
Bonnie, this can't be us.
Come on.
Oh, God.
Hey.
Hey.
Caroline's okay for now.
I'm gonna check in on her later.
- What about the guy that she? - Ugh, it's taken care of.
Damon's right, isn't he? It won't end well for her.
No, I'm gonna make sure that he's wrong.
I just I can't believe what this day has turned into.
Not your normal day, huh? Mm-mm.
I was stupid to think that it could be.
I mean, nothing about my life is normal.
My best friend is a witch.
Boyfriend's a vampire and I have a doppelganger who's hell-bent on destroying all of us.
I'm sorry.
No, it's not your fault, Stefan.
It's no one's fault.
You know, it is what it is.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's just You know what? I'm fine.
Okay.
I'm gonna call you tomorrow.
Okay? - Good night, Stefan.
- Good night.
MRS.
LOCKWOOD: It's good for Tyler to have you in the house.
- I appreciate that, Carol.
- Hmm.
Oh, and I can see if I can dig up that stone you're looking for.
It's bound to be tucked away in one of Richard's nooks and crannies.
- Hey, man.
You heading up? - In a minute.
- Night, Mom.
- Night, Tyler.
Hey, I'm sorry about earlier.
We all good? - Yeah.
We're good.
- All right.
Hell are you doing here? You don't lock your front door.
Yeah.
No, I wouldn't.
I laced it with vervain.
Now why would you do that? So I could stake you with this.
You came here to kill me? Well, it's only fair.
You killed me first.
What made you wisen up? My father hated vampires.
My uncle too.
They were absolute.
They knew exactly what they stood for.
And I figure maybe I should too.
I mean, stand for something.
But killing you, what's that gonna do? Look, I don't do the big brother thing very well.
Sorry I don't have any cookies and milk to offer you.
Dick.
Wait.
- My father hated vampires too.
- He did? Same reason your Dad did.
Only it was 1864.
People knew how to whittle.
- Did you do this? - Yeah, I tried.
It's harder than it looks.
Huh.
What are you doing here? Uh I came to see if today's basket-case period had expired.
You should just go because my mom's gonna be home soon.
You've been dodging me all day.
I mean, I'm more insecure than you are now.
What do you mean? It means that you almost died and it really freaked me out.
And it got me thinking, you know, because I'm just I'm not in a position where I can lose someone else right now.
I realized that even though today I wanted to throttle you I'm pretty sure that I'm in love with you.
And now it seems like you don't feel the same way.
- Mm.
Hi.
What time is it? - It's almost dawn.
Come with me.
Stefan, what are we doing here? We're gonna get caught.
I compelled the guard to go on break so I could kiss my girlfriend on top of the Ferris wheel.
- Stefan - We have to take these moments, Elena.
All right? What Katherine did to Caroline could just be the beginning.
There's things with Tyler's family that we don't understand.
And there's always the D-word.
But I came back to this town to start a life with you.
We can't forget to live it.
But, Stefan, how are we gonna get to the top? I guess you'll just have to hold on tight.
What? It's just so nice to see you laugh.
It's not gonna get any easier, is it? No.
It's not.
