Previously on The Vampire Diaries: Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them.
Since then werewolves can only turn on a full moon.
And vampires are weakened by the sun.
You're saying that the oldest vampire in history is coming after me? Wanna find Klaus? Start with Isobel, Elena's mother.
- I'm prepared to offer a deal.
- Deal? Stay put and stop trying to get yourself killed.
- Why are you helping me? - I don't want you to be alone.
A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
Don't be his friend.
- What are you doing here? - I miss you.
- Hey.
- I'm Jules.
I'm trying to track down Mason.
- You should leave town.
- Threatening me? On a full moon.
It's healing.
Mm.
Morning.
Everything all right here? It was an animal.
A wolf.
It came at us in the night.
Are you okay? Yes.
But my friends, they're all dead.
I'm calling it in.
Come in, dispatch.
MAN Go ahead, Jerry.
Stefan? Stefan.
You're standing right behind me, aren't you? Yep.
Mm.
- Good morning.
- I don't want us to be apart anymore.
- Ever.
- Me neither, but Don't ruin the moment.
- You're about to ruin the moment.
- I'm totally ruining the moment.
- I can't just pretend everything's okay.
- Katherine's locked away in the tomb.
I know, but we still have this pressing little issue of you being Klaus' human sacrifice.
Yes, but Elijah promised to keep me and everyone else safe as long as we played by his rules.
As long as you played by his rules.
Please don't go after Isobel.
Katherine said Isobel could have some answers and I have a couple questions, that's all.
Stefan, I made a deal with Elijah.
Right, you made a deal with him.
I didn't make one.
You should keep your deal.
Stefan, I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
When have I ever wanted somebody to get hurt? Vervain.
I made it light.
But are you sure? Just because Katherine built up a tolerance Yes.
Bottoms up.
- You okay? - Yeah.
Ahem.
How can Elijah compel another vampire? He's an original.
I don't really know what that means.
I don't think anybody really knows what that means.
Well, except maybe Isobel.
I'll be sure to ask her.
I was born in 1450, that makes me 560 years old.
Well, if you were a bottle of wine So I can die.
I've lived long enough.
If you're gonna be maudlin, I'm just gonna kill you myself just to put me out of your misery.
Come on, it's just a little werewolf bite.
Just a little fatal-to-a-vampire werewolf bite.
Well, according to legend, which is a notoriously unreliable source.
Drink up.
Blood heals.
Yeah.
- It does feel like it's working.
- Let's have a look.
Come on.
Let me see.
How is it? Uh, definitely better.
Right, Elena? Um - It's not bad.
- Where's Stefan? He left.
I need you to talk to him.
He's convinced he has to find Isobel, but that's gonna upset Elijah.
No can do, I'm with Stefan on this one.
But if you could play nurse for a little while - It's not necessary.
- It is necessary.
Elena's a do-gooder.
It's in her nature, she just can't resist.
Damon.
Is she gonna die? Probably.
The wolf bite caused some kind of infection.
It's getting worse.
- Like a poison? - I don't know, Elena.
I'm not an expert in the field.
- I'm sorry.
- Death happens.
We come, we go.
Sooner she dies, the better.
It's gloomy as hell in here.
- How you feeling? - I'm okay.
Sore.
I mean, every muscle aches.
You did it.
You know, you Your first full moon and you didn't hurt anyone.
It'll get easier.
You'll get better at it, learn to control it and it won't hurt so much.
Well, we don't know any of that for sure.
No, but small victories, Tyler.
Last night was a victory.
You know, let's take it.
Look, I really wanna thank you.
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there.
Um, yeah, anyway, um, next month, we should probably, uh, reinforce the wall because, I mean, you almost got me that one time and it just would have been, um - What? - Never mind.
It's Ha, ha.
Hey, no.
Hey, no.
What? What is it? Well, it's not a big thing.
It's just that one bite and it's, uh, you know, curtains for me.
What are you talking about? The legend says that a bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire.
How do you know that? I I think I read it somewhere, um Hey, Caroline, you got a second? Hey, Matt.
What's up? Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll see you guys later.
That was nothing, okay? There's nothing going on between Tyler and I.
- We were just talking - I believe you.
Look, Caroline, you're a lot of things, but you're not a liar.
You've always been straight with me.
I believe you.
Well, good.
And that's why I wanna be straight with you because I think we got some wires crossed here.
Oh.
Okay.
You know how tongue-tied I get, and, well, l I don't like this.
Whatever this is that's going on between us.
And I just wanna Hey.
- You can't.
- Why? - Just - But, Car No, Matt.
Okay? Sheriff Forbes.
Hi, I'm Mason Lockwood's friend from Florida.
Jules, right? Is there any news? No one's heard from him.
I've opened an investigation.
As soon as I hear anything, I'll let you know.
Hey, Damon, the, uh, wolf is in the Grill.
Thank you.
Oh, is that the, uh? Yeah.
Yeah.
I just, uh, left Damon a message.
- So you're doing his dirty work for him.
- Hmm.
She could have a cure for Rose.
I couldn't find anything in Isobel's research.
Except that it's fatal.
Do you still know of a way to get in touch with, uh With Isobel? Even if I did, she isn't gonna help.
Katherine said that Isobel knew of Klaus.
So this isn't about Rose.
It's about Elena.
I have an old number.
Probably out of service.
No harm in giving it to me, then? You know you can't trust Isobel.
Even when it comes to Elena.
I know that.
All right.
I'll see if I can find the number.
If I do, I'll text it to you.
I hate this.
I'm a vampire.
I haven't had a cold in five centuries.
- Just get in bed.
- We don't get sick.
When we die, it's fast and sudden.
And it's certainly not drawn out with an illness.
- You're not gonna die.
- Such a human thing to say.
You've never been in Damon's room before, have you? Not what you expected.
It's just a room with a bed.
Maybe I expected there to be silk sheets.
You're lucky, you know.
No one's ever loved me the way you're loved.
- Well, I doubt that.
- Trevor was my best friend.
Nothing more.
I spent all those years on the run from Elijah.
I just never thought it was a good idea to set up roots.
The whole idea of family is not exactly compatible with being a vampire.
- Why are you so eager to give up? - I'm not giving up on anything.
Here.
What do you call this whole deal with Elijah? - I call it my best option.
- It's your easiest option.
That's not fair.
You think your witch friend destroyed the moonstone? I spoke with Bonnie.
I know she had the help of another witch.
I'm assuming it's Elijah's witch, so, no, I don't.
You really are determined to die, aren't you? At least I ran.
You're not even trying.
I'm so tired.
No, stop, wait.
Tell them to prepare the horses.
It's okay, Rose.
Just get some sleep.
You'll feel better when you wake up.
Trevor, don't be so stupid we're never gonna make it there before the sun.
Elena.
Elena, I need more blood.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Here.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's all your fault, Katerina.
- You, Katerina, you did this.
- It's Elena, Rose.
- You betrayed us.
- I'm not Katherine.
Elena? - Oh, my God.
- It's me.
It's Elena.
Oh, my God, Elena.
I'm so sorry.
- I don't know what's happening to me.
- It's all right.
You're gonna be all right.
My mind, I'm It was just for a second.
- I'm sorry.
Don't be scared of me.
- I'm not.
I'm not, but You need to rest.
I'm scared.
You're not alone.
I'm right here.
Here.
Where's here? Damon's bedroom.
You're in Damon's bedroom.
I wanna go home.
Tell me about it.
St.
Austell.
Thirty kilometers south of London.
All fields and trees and horses.
Sounds beautiful.
When you live long enough, everything disappears.
So much time wasted.
I just wish I hadn't been so afraid.
Isobel, it's Stefan Salvatore.
I, um I need to speak with you.
It's about Elena.
Please know that it's important.
- What are you doing? - Waiting for you.
Listen, there's a lot of people here.
Damn, there goes my plan to rip her spleen through her back.
Hey, I know you're upset about Rose.
Why does everyone think I'm upset about Rose? I'm fine.
I don't know if you know this, sometimes vampires die.
I'm gonna have a friendly chat with lady wolf, brother.
Ease up.
Hello? Well if it isn't the one I meant to kill.
- I'll have to get that right next time.
- You won't live to see another full moon.
Unless Unless you tell me how to cure a wolf bite.
And then I won't kill you.
Promise? Yes.
Bite me.
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Then you are very, very stupid.
How's your friend? Rose? Is that her name? Have the chills started? The unbearable pain? If there's a cure, tell me.
Or start watching your back.
Did I mention the dementia? It'll eat away at her brain.
Soon she'll be rabid.
You want a cure? I'll tell you the only cure that exists.
Take a stake and drive it through her heart.
I brought some clean sheets.
It's Elena, I'm worried about Rose.
I think you should come home.
Rose? Oh, my God.
- Katerina.
- No.
Rose, stop.
Stop.
It's Elena.
I'm not Katherine.
You're hallucinating.
I'm not Katherine.
I'm not Katherine.
Elena, I know that it's you and not Katherine.
Elena, please.
I need your help.
Caroline.
- Why? - Why what? - I kissed you.
- I know.
I was there.
So why'd you run away? - You caught me off guard.
- Yeah? - What did you expect me to do? - Not that.
- I'm sorry.
- And? And what? What do you want me to say, Matt? Something.
Anything.
How? How did you feel? Anything in the realm of truth right now would be nice.
Okay.
I feel like I I love you.
"I love you"? Then what's the problem? What are you keeping from me, Car? Look, if you love me, you'll tell me.
So, what is it? Hey, Matt, we need more burgers.
Yeah, not now, Dana.
You okay? - Where's Rose? - I don't know.
Excuse me.
Are you okay? - Hi.
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- I was close by.
What happened? - A vampire.
One of my deputies discovered the body before anyone saw him.
We have to secure the area, then.
Don't cause a panic, but move this party into the cafeteria.
- I'll take the east side.
You go west? - Sure.
Okay.
Hey, Stefan, it's me.
I don't know where you are, but please call me.
It's important.
Have you heard from him? Do you know what he's up to? My brother's not exactly my priority right now.
Here, take this.
Come on.
Let's go.
Hey, what was going on back there with the police? Some maintenance man had a heart attack.
Just dropped dead.
Eddie? Rose, stop! Rose.
Rose.
It's me.
It's Damon.
It's Damon.
It's Damon.
It's Damon.
Did I do this? Oh, my God.
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
- I never wanted to hurt anybody.
- I know.
I know.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Come on, let's get you home.
No, I don't have a home.
I haven't had a home in so long.
Oh, make it stop.
Please, make it stop.
I hate it.
Make it stop.
Come on.
Hi there.
- I'm sorry.
- You went on a murderous rampage.
It happens.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I don't like taking human life.
I never have.
You shouldn't be here.
It's the worst part about it, the hunt.
The need to kill, the thirst.
The pleasure it brings you afterwards.
I wasn't meant to be evil.
- It hurts.
- Well, then stop talking about it.
Damon's a lot like me.
He wants to care.
The minute he does, he runs away from it.
I'm sorry for what I've done today.
- I know.
- And you need to fight.
I know that you're scared, but you have to do it anyway.
Mm.
Mm.
Why are you so nice to me? Us humans.
You can never forget it.
What it's like to be human.
It haunts me but it's the only thing that's kept me going.
Doesn't hurt as much anymore.
- What do we do? - Go.
- Okay.
- Damon Just go.
I got this.
Oh, my God, make it stop! Make it stop! Oh, I can't take it anymore.
Please, stop.
Hey.
Where have you been? Down at the school.
Uh, what's up? What do you want? - We need to talk.
- Why? What's wrong with you? I just don't understand one thing.
- What? - Why would you risk it? If a werewolf bite kills a vampire why would you risk it? - Um, because you needed help.
- I could have killed you.
But you didn't.
I don't understand you, Caroline.
Why is it so hard for you to let someone else help you? - Well, that's not it.
- Yeah, it is, Tyler.
It's like you don't want anyone to care about you.
And I'm sorry I care.
I care, Tyler.
So forgive me if I overstepped my boundaries by actually giving a You can't do that.
I'm sorry.
It's Everyone just needs to stop kissing me.
Who'd have thought you'd be a nice guy? Hmm, I'm not nice.
I'm mean.
I like it.
You lie.
Shh.
Shh.
Just sleep.
Just sleep.
This was my favorite place to come as a girl.
How did you know? Word gets around.
You told Elena.
Am I dreaming? The sun is so warm.
I miss this.
I miss being human.
Humanity's not all it's cracked up to be.
I had friends.
I had a family.
I mattered.
You still do.
No.
But you do.
You've built a life, whether you want to admit it or not.
- I spent 500 years just existing.
- You didn't have a choice.
- You were running from Klaus.
- No, there's always a choice.
You know, you are ruining our perfect day with your strange philosophical babbling.
I'd like to enjoy the fresh air.
Will you enjoy it with me? For a while.
Thank you.
For what? The pain's gone.
I'm glad.
Will I see them again? My family? I think you will see whoever you wanna see.
That would be nice.
Maybe I'll see Trevor too.
I'm not afraid anymore.
- I'll race you to the trees.
- Well, you'll lose.
I'm older and faster.
- Oh, you think? - Ha, ha.
Well, I'm controlling this dream.
Maybe I'll cheat.
On the count of three.
One two Here's your vampire.
- How did you find her? - Doesn't matter.
It's over.
Thank you.
Once again, you've help keep this town safe.
I'll take care of burying the body.
Thank you for coming.
- What do you want from me? - Just to be your friend.
Mason would have wanted that.
I know about Mason.
And you.
- You know what? - I know you're a werewolf.
And I know your little friend, Caroline is a vampire.
- How do you know about Caroline? - You can't sniff them out? Oh, my God you are brand-new.
How many times have you turned? Hey, I can help you.
Do you know where Mason is? He's dead, Tyler.
He was murdered.
- No.
- You wanna know who murdered him? - Just stop.
- Your little blond vampire did.
No, Caroline would never do that.
She and her little vampire friends were behind it.
Caroline is the only vampire in town.
Is that what she told you? She lied.
This town is crawling with vampires.
But don't worry, we'll get them.
Who are you? I'm your friend.
There are others like us and they're on their way.
- You were supposed to leave.
- I did.
Then I came back to make sure that you're okay.
I appreciate the gesture.
I'm just glad it's over.
You know I don't believe that.
Go home, Elena.
Get some rest.
It's a whole new day tomorrow.
- I'm your friend.
- I'm well aware of that.
A friend knows when their friend is hurting.
What do you wanna hear? That I cared about Rose? That I'm upset? Well, I didn't and I'm not.
There you go, pretending to turn it off, pretending not to feel.
Damon, you're so close.
Don't give up.
I feel, Elena.
Okay? And it sucks.
What sucks even more is that it was supposed to be me.
Jules was coming after me.
You feel guilty.
That would be human of me, wouldn't it, Elena? I'm not human.
You're one to talk about giving up.
All you've done is give up.
Go home.
There's been enough doom, gloom and personal growth for one night.
Okay.
I will.
Good night, Damon.
Stefan, you're home.
Rose? - I, uh I called Isobel.
- I know.
- I'm sorry.
I had to.
- It's okay.
- Did you find her? - Not exactly.
Hello, Elena.
Uncle John.
Sir, are you okay? What happened? I'm lost.
And you're laying in the middle of the road? Not that kind of lost.
Metaphorically.
Existentially.
- Do you need help? - Well yes, I do.
Can you help me? - You're drunk.
- No.
Uh, well, yes, a little.
Maybe.
No, please don't leave.
I really do need help.
- Don't move.
- I don't want any trouble.
Neither do I.
But that's all I got is trouble.
Why can't I move? - What's your name? - Jessica.
Jessica, I have a secret.
I have a big one, but I've never said it out loud.
I mean, what's the point? It's not gonna change anything.
It's not gonna make me good.
Make me adopt a puppy.
I can't be what other people want me to be.
What she wants me to be.
This is who I am, Jessica.
- Are you gonna hurt me? - I'm not sure.
Because you are my existential crisis.
Do I kill you, or do I not kill you? Please, don't.
But I have to, Jessica, because I'm not human.
And I miss it.
I miss it more than anything in the world.
That is my secret.
But there's only so much hurt a man can take.
Please, don't.
Okay.
You're free to go.
