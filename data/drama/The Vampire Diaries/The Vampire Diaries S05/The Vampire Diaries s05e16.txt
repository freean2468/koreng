While You Were Sleeping



                    			Previously on "The Vampire Diaries" My name's Aaron Whitmore. Your last name is Whitmore? So, you, like, own the school? I passengered myself into Elena's cute, little head. I'm sorry, Damon. We're over. Elena thinks I'm a monster. She's right. Oh! Wes has this sick, little scheme to destroy vampires by making them feed on each other. Damon, stop. Which one of you is gonna get to kill the elusive Katherine Pierce once and for all? Well, you're here. That means I'm dead. True. I left Elena with a little bit of a parting gift. What is she doing? Having fun, obviously. It's about time, too. Take it off! Matt! Jeremy, come on. To friends. To friends! Am I seriously that easy to impersonate or do you guys not know me at all? Elena, what's going on? When have I ever danced on a bar half-naked? Do you think that I would come to a college bar with my underage brother and do Tequila shots? Elena, what are you talking about? I'm not Elena, Matt. I'm Katherine. It's not me. You guys know me. I wouldn't do that. Guys, Katherine has taken over my body. This isn't me. Hello? Hello? Hey. You're awake. Stefan. What are you doing here? Where is everyone? Everyone's gone. The whole school cleared out for spring break. You've been in and out since you first woke up. Oh. Ok, yeah, that makes sense. I thought I was going crazy. What's going on? What we had to seal you into the building. We have a lot of catching up to do. The last thing I remember, I was running through the woods, and my head felt like it was being attacked by Katherine's whole life. Then I saw Damon, I threw my arms around him, and Then nothing. Yeah, that was about And yet, it took just one second for Katherine to infect me with some virus that makes me want to kill all my friends. Well, you know Katherine. She's not about to go out without a grand finale. Do you really think this whole lockdown is necessary? I mean I feel fine. Look, we shouldn't take any chances. If Damon taught us anything, it's that the virus makes you want to attack at the mere scent of vampire blood. How did you Liv. Liv? She's a new witch. Bonnie's been teaching her some spells. Look, I know that this is a lot to process, but just know that Caroline is out looking for an antidote, and in the meantime, we've figured out a way to ration blood to keep you satiated. We're gonna figure this out, ok? I need to talk to Damon. Hilarious. Give me the damn cup. Ahh. Wipe that smile off your face. Hey, you're lucky I'm even helping you, considering the last thing you did for me was to tell Enzo to strangle me to death. Quit crying. You're still around. Yeah, more than we can say for Aaron Whitmore. Weren't he and Elena tight? Yep. Does she know Damon killed him? I don't know. Does she? No, she doesn't, because I'm gonna be the one to tell her. And if either one of you clowns beats me to it, I'll rip your tongue out. Don't even think about it. Damon's phone. Jer? Elena. Hey. How you feeling? Confused but good. I miss you. Same here. I killed you once before, Gilbert. I'll kill you again. Someone wants to speak to you. Go. Hey, you. Hey, you. So, eat anyone yet? Nope. So far, I am symptom-free. Although Stefan still has me on the "Damon diet" just in case. Oh, yeah, it sucks. Oof. You're gonna be craving carbs constantly. But hey, you know what? There's a plus side. You get to keep your girlish figure. I'm calling you on a pay phone. Well, how retro of you. Does that mean you've memorized my phone number? Maybe. Katherine put a pass code on my cell, so, I can't use it. Ah, that would explain all those crazy instagram pics you've been uploading lately. What? Kidding, kidding. Damon, that's not funny. I don't know what I've been doing for the last 3 weeks. I know. I'm sorry. Well, what do you want to know? I'll tell you. How did she do it? How did she do what? Break your heart. Oh. That. I don't know. It's not like it's been playing on a loop in my head over and over again so I barely remember. I'm so sorry. I really am. I mean, the last thing I remember, I was running into your arms and I felt so safe. Well, it was all downhill from there. I wanted to fight for you. I still do. Oh, Elena, the second we're cured of this and we don't want to rip each other's heads off, I am going to hunt you down and give you the most mindblowing night of your life. I think I could schedule you in. Huh. One question: How exactly do we cure this? I've managed to extract the werewolf venom from Nadia Petrova's blood. The addition of the venom will make the ripper virus even more lethal to vampires. Oh, my God. So, werewolves are real. I was told that was just like, you know, a joke. I'm Enzo. The Enzo? No, the other one. All right, other Enzo, I don't know what it is you're doing here, but I don't want any part of it. I'm here for the same reason you are. I want this vampire-feeding virus out of our lives. Why? You want your killing buddy back? Killing innocent people not as much fun when you're alone? Right. Damon mentioned you get a little judgy. Then again, he also said you had a thing for accents. Just stay out of it. We don't need any more problems. Then you're not the least bit impressed that I have the antidote? Can we talk about the irony of Katherine Pierce sitting through a college lecture? Oh, no, I'm flunking, aren't I? No way. If anything, there's some sucker probably compelled to spend his entire spring break doing your homework. Yeah, you're probably right. Let's add that to the list of things I need to fix, starting with Aaron. Aaron? What the hell does he have to do with anything? I haven't seen or talked to him since he found out that I was a vampire and thought I wanted to kill him. Well, uh You probably won't find him. Why? No reason. Elena? Uh, Stefan just got here. He bought me a new cell phone. I'm gonna call you right back, ok? You ok? Uh, not feeling so good all of a sudden. It's because you're starving. Yeah. Here, I got you You won't be scaling any buildings, but it'll curb the cravings. Thank you. Ahh. I need more. I'm sorry. I feel fine, Stefan. I just I just need a little more. You're not fine, Elena. Trust me. I just I can handle this. - Think so? - Yeah. You're not fine, Elena. She's turning me into a monster. I'm a ripper, aren't I? You'll feed until you kill, yeah. I hate her. No, you know what? I hate myself. Because I was dumb enough to sit next to her while she was dying and actually forgive her. Hey. Please tell me that's some good news. Bad news. It's not the same virus. What is it? Dr. Creepenstein was working on the next phase of his virus. When Nadia was sick, he was experimenting on her blood and then he figured out a way to extract werewolf venom from her blood and put it into the virus. Hey, what do you mean werewolf venom? That means it's fatal. Oh, my God. Hello? You don't think I would just drop this on you without a silver lining? There's an antidote. It just requires you to come meet me. I'll text you the address. Or you can just bring it over here. No, you have to go there, and don't ask me why because I can't tell you. Caroline, that doesn't make any sense. Just tell me exactly if I could tell you, don't you think I would be there right now to help Elena? I'll text you the address. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what is going on. The travelers don't want anyone to know what they're up to. And by anyone I mean newbie emo witch types with bad attitudes. Just get there fast, ok? I'll see you soon. Stefan? Yeah? Why did you stay? What do you mean? Katherine. Why didn't she run like she normally does? Why did she stay? Oh. You know Katherine. Staying alive wasn't enough. She She wanted it all. You mean you. She wanted you. Did we ever actually, we We kissed. Oh, ok. Um And then And then I pulled away. Then I put it together. She wasn't you. I gotta go. I mean, you gotta admit, it was pretty rad. I locked a vampire in her dorm with an invisible seal. I mean, how many newbie witches have that on their resume? If they do, they don't brag about it as loudly. Come on. This place is dead. Like, serious spring break-itis. Besides, you're not even a little proud of me? Ok, hot shot. Set it on fire. What? Simple fire spell. Ok. Phasmatos ingitum dox un salvo. Phasmatos ingitum dox un salvo. Phasmatos ingitum dox un salvo. That's weird. Guess your resume still needs a little padding. Hey, it's Aaron. Leave me a message, or don't. Whatever. Hey, Aaron, it's Elena. I ahem. I hope that you're off on some private island somewhere enjoying your spring break. Look, a lot has happened And I'd really like to talk about it. If you're still willing to talk to me. So, call me back, ok? All right. Bye. Dear diary. I love my life. Seriously. Becoming Elena Gilbert is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Oh, my God. Spent the day on the road with Stefan, although the highlight was our little pit stop at the hotel. I had to wash up after "accidentally" getting grease on my shirt. Oh, well. I didn't like this shirt anyway. Ahh. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Warning the next time? It's nothing you haven't seen before. I know. I'm just saying there's a bathroom less than 10 feet away. You know, that's what I like about you, Stefan. Always a gentleman. You don't have to turn away, you know. There's nothing stopping us. We're both single now. And we're alone. Stefan, it's not me. It's Katherine, Stefan. She's seducing you. Stop. What are you doing? This isn't me, Stefan. Can't you tell? After everything we've been through. I wouldn't lead you on like that. Damon? Stefan, Stefan, Stefan. "I have grease on my shirt. I need to wash up"? Come on, man, that's the oldest trick in the book. It's not like you saw through her. I wasn't the one making out with her. Stop it, ok? Both of you. This is what she wants. Even dead, she is ruining our lives. Oh, you think this is bad? You have no idea, do you? About what? About what, Stefan? What the hell is happening to me? He'll tell her. When? "Hey, Elena, I killed Aaron." It's not exactly casual conversation. Killing someone in cold blood isn't casual but Damon managed that just fine. Or I can just tell her. Considering I was lying in the road when he stopped his car. So, what's in this for you? Aside from getting Damon to undo every positive decision he's ever made? Is it such an anomaly for Damon to have a friend? Well, if so, consider me honored. Ok, we're here. Where is the antidote? Who are you? I'm Sloan, and you met some of the travelers when they were taking a bucket of your blood. Oh, yeah. How could I forget? So, you have the antidote to this ripper virus, correct? We do, thanks to Enzo. I was trapped in that bloody farm house with Damon. Set to have my head torn off when out of nowhere Wes, with the help of the travelers, saved my life. On the condition I owed him one. What does that have to do with us? He was running low on vampires, and he needed one to continue his work, so I let him experiment on me. Among other things, it allowed him to make an antidote. When he died, the travelers took it. And seeing as Elena is valuable to us, we're in the process of using Wes' resources to find a cure for her virus as well. Fine. When will it be done? First we have to find something. Ok. What do you need? Another one of you. What do you mean, werewolf venom? I mean, I'm deteriorating. Slowly. I seem to be hallucinating all my worst fears. So, that's been fun. I should come over there. You can't. We would tear each other apart, remember? Besides, I I look gross. Oh, yeah, well, never mind. Would be awful. Distract me. All right. What are you wearing? Damon, come on. Tell me. What else have I missed? Ok, ok, ok, let's see. Um It's been unseasonably cold. Jeremy bought a bunch of new x-box games that are ridiculously loud and obnoxious. Tyler had a party. It was lame. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Did you hear the gossip? What gossip? Caroline and an original hybrid sittin' in a tree. No. Yup. Are you serious? Caroline and Klaus? Mm-hmm. Wait, does Tyler know about this? Yup, and guess who told him. Katherine? Katherine is such a bitch. That she is. Sorry. You ok? Um I just don't understand why Stefan's off at some mystery location. Why don't we hunt down Wes and force him to make us an antidote? That's easier said than done. Wes is dead. What? I killed him. Please don't act like he didn't deserve it. What about Aaron, Damon? He didn't deserve that. Wes was pretty much the closest thing that Aaron had to a family. Soup's on. The highlight of my day. I will check on you later, ok? Yeah. Yeah, ok. What do you mean, there is another one of me out there? Ever stop to think there might be another doppelganger roaming around? Clearly, you don't know your traveler lore. I'm sorry, and you do? Having stuck with them for the past few weeks, I've picked up a few things. Like how the last remaining pair of doppelgangers are special. Special how? None of your business. You'll have to excuse Sloan. She's under a bit of stress. The leader of the travelers Marcus, was it? - Markos. - Markos, see, wants the blood from the last remaining pair of doppelgangers, I.E., you and Elena. Why? Apparently, it's special. Special how? Don't think I didn't ask. As we've witnessed, the travelers are very secretive. But what we do know is that until the last doppelganger's out of the picture, your blood, when mixed with Elena's, doesn't do squat. So, what, you do a locator spell to find this guy and then you kill him? It's more of a linking spell. Last time a witch linked me to my doppelganger, she fried my brain and I lost my memory. Then we better be careful. Uhh. Ooh. Aaron? Hey there. I thought you were on spring break. Are you ok? I'm sick. It's a long story. Look, I really wanted to talk to you about everything, because the last couple weeks, I haven't been myself. Literally. Katherine Pierce has been inside my body and - Ooh. - That would explain a lot, actually. Why? Did I do something? Why is none of your stuff here? Because I'm not actually here. What do you mean? Are you another hallucination? Are you dead? Did I do this to you? Aaron, tell me that I didn't kill you. Did I kill you? Tell me that I didn't kill you. Please. Please. No. Elena. Elena. Wow, Elena Gilbert. Get up, you lush. Whoa, whoa. Jeez. I see someone started her spring break early. How did you get in here? I thought the door was closed. David dumped my ass at senor frog's, of all horrifying places. He thought I was cheating on him. So, I took the first flight out of Cancun and here I am. Do I know you? I'm Luke. We met at the bitter ball? You're very drunk. All right, let me shower off this airplane stench and we can drown our sorrows in rum runners. That doesn't sound like a good idea. Do not tell me you and Stefan hooked up while I was gone. Whoa, are you ok? I'm just so thirsty. Ok. We'll get you some water, all right? Don't touch me. You need help. No, what I need is to feed. Don't move. I need vampire blood. What are you doing? I need to turn you. I'm sorry. What is that? What what is it? Uh, my paranoid boyfriend thought they were hickies. But it obviously is some kind of disgusting rash or something. Or your friend "Elena" was feeding on you. Listen to me. Forget this conversation. Go find Bonnie Bennett. Tell her to come here and bring the witch. I need to get out of here right now. Go! Run! I don't know what's happening to me, Damon. I know. Look, you're sick. So, just try to relax. I feel like no one's telling me the truth, Damon. I can't tell what's real anymore. Stefan will be there really soon. I did it, didn't I? I killed him. - What? - Aaron. That's what you're so afraid to tell me. Aaron. I killed him. Listen, Elena, I will tell you everything, but right now is not the time. Now is not the time, Damon? I'm dying. I almost turned a student today. Just so that I could feed on him. When would a good time be, listen, Elena, whoa,. Calm down. Listen to my voice. You will get through this. I will help you. No. No, no, no, no you're lying. - You're lying! - Elena, calm down, please. Why is everyone lying to me? You're lying to me. Why is everyone lying to me? Why is everyone lying to me? Donovan! Donovan, get your ass in here. Chill. I'm right here. What? Phone's dead. Charge it for me. Too much sexting with Elena? How about you never say that again. Damon, stop. Jeremy! Whoa! What the hell? I need to see your sister. Undo my chains or I'll kill him. I can't. You'll kill her. She's gonna hurt herself, Jeremy. She's totally unraveling. Don't do it, Jeremy. Don't be an idiot, Jeremy. Trust me. She needs me. I would never hurt her, Jeremy. Look, I know there's a lot of them, but between you, me, and Enzo, I bet we can take them. Did you really just say that? Sorry. I'm desperate. It'll be fine. Yeah, until you lose your memory again. Well, if I lose my memory, then I won't remember I had anything to worry about in the first place. See? Win-win. Who volunteers themselves for witchy electric shock therapy? Me, and I would do it for you, too. Look, let's just say that they do fry my brain. I'll kill them. Right, and then you'll spiral out of control about killing them. And then, do me a favor. Remind me, we were friends. That's for you. Sit. Where are the antidotes? You'll get it when we're done. No, you'll hand them over right now. I'm here. I'm doing everything you want me to. I'll take them. I'll make sure the appropriate parties get them. If you don't trust me, you're welcome to join, goldilocks. No, I want to stay with Stefan. Very well. Best of luck. Wait, you said that you weren't gonna hurt him. No, I said I'd try not to hurt him. We need his blood for the spell. Wait a second. Tessa didn't need my blood when she linked me to Silas. Good for her. We do. Odka na vonas czech. Nat misteni. Odka na vonas czech. Nat misteni. Odka na vonas czech. Nat misteni. Elena, what are you doing? I'm cleansing myself of anything that Katherine touched. Toothbrush. My clothes. My sheets. Elena, stop. You're not yourself. That's ironic, because I wasn't myself for weeks, and yet nobody noticed. She's losing it. Are you Liv? I'm sorry if we've met before, but I'm really gonna need you to drop this seal and let me out right now. It's too dangerous for you to be out in public when you're sick. You think that's dangerous, Bonnie? If you don't drop this seal right now, I will kill you. Elena, stop. This is the virus. It's in your head. Katherine wanted to destroy you, and it's working. You have to fight it. Oh, my God. You're right. You're right, Bonnie. You're right. I can't I'm letting her win. I'm letting her win. I can't let her win. I'm not gonna let her win. Uhh! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You will die if I don't give you my blood to heal you, so, you're gonna have to drop the seal. Otherwise, you're gonna bleed to death. So, hurry. It's your choice. Odka na vonas czech. Nat misteni. Odka na vonas czech. Nat misteni. - Aah! - Why is this taking so long? Just a little deeper. Odka na vonas czech. Nat misteni. You're gonna be ok. Stay still. She's going into shock. I need the ppm. Just stay with me I see him. He's in a city. He's in Atlanta. Good. That's great. You found him. Keep going. Push harder. Odka na vonas czech. Nat misteni. Uhh! You said that you know where he is. What are you doing? I'm not done. The link is strong enough. We need more information. - Aah! - You're pushing him too hard! He's gonna lose everything. Stop! We need the doppelganger dead. Uhh! Louder! Na vonas czech. Nat misteni. Odka na vonas czech. Nat misteni. If you hurt me, they'll kill you. Tell them to stop. There's a way we can all get what we want. Elena? Oh, my God. Aaron? Are you alive? You don't look so hot. No. No, I'm good. I'm good now. I'm good now. I thought I thought I killed you. I didn't kill you. You're right here. Oh! You're still alive. It's me. It's Damon. Hey. You're hallucinating. No here. Drink this. It's Stefan's blood. Drink this. She won. Katherine won. - Don't say that. - Look at me, Damon. Look at me. Look at me. The plague of Katherine Pierce lives on. She's turning me into something that I'm not. Look at me. I'm a monster. Liv, the witch, I almost killed her. And my friends, I mean, I want to kill my friends. I think I think if I killed my friends come here. It's ok. No, it's not ok! It's not ok, Damon. I killed Aaron Whitmore. No No. He keeps Following me everywhere. I'm hallucinating that Aaron's around here. Elena, look at me. Hey, look at me. You did not kill Aaron Whitmore. I did. What? Why? W-was it because of the virus? Did you need to turn him? It was before I was infected. Listen, if you want specifics, it was the night that I thought that you broke up with me, Elena. I killed him to convince myself that you were right. That I was the type of person who could kill in cold blood, and I was never gonna change. That's why. I need you to say something. Why is Enzo here? Sorry to interrupt, but I have the antidote. Although from the looks of it, you'd both rather be dead. Hi. Rebekah. Hi. Oh, my God. I'm kidding. Lexi, right? It was funnier the first time. Did it work? Engine's running, blondie. Appreciate the call. Let's go do this thing. Did I miss something? Sloan was gonna fry your brain in order to kill your other you. I wasn't about to let that happen, so, I may have volunteered to help Enzo deal with it. You mean Kill him. Caroline, I can't let you they only want one alive, remember? It's you or him. All right, fine, well, I'm coming with you. No, mate, it's you or you aren't. They need to use you to keep track of him. Tick-tock, gorgeous. Time is of the essence. I'll be fine, Stefan. Besides, you'd do the same for me, right? I don't trust him. Don't worry. I don't, either. I'll be safe. I promise. Guess we should donate my shirt to Elena's fire cleanse. I'm so sorry about all this. Hey, I survived my first vampire attack. I mean, it's just one more thing to add to the resume. Look, if you don't want any part of this, I get it. Magic isn't for everyone. I won't be offended. No. I want this. And I want you to teach me. Good. Then I'll see you tomorrow bright and early for some levitation. Awesome. Catch you tomorrow. Show off. Luke, what the hell? I was about to take my shirt off. Relax. I'm gay and your brother, so technically, you're the least attractive person in the world to me. Are you ok? I'm sorry I had to drag you into this, but Elena thought she was compelling me and I couldn't give up the ruse. I'm fine. After Elena gutted me, she gave me some of her blood. And how is our precious anchor to the other side? I'm letting her think she's teaching me magic. It's kind of cute. Until she realizes her friends are in jeopardy. Then, not so cute. No. She speaks. Care to share anything else churning around in that beautiful head of yours? You should have noticed. What? That I was Katherine. That Katherine was me. You should have been the one that noticed. You don't think I know that? If only you'd seen through her, Damon There would be no vampire virus. Aaron would still be alive Katherine didn't do this. I did. I thought you broke my heart so I ripped open Aaron's neck. That is how much control you have over me. And I'm still here. That's how much control you have over me. Listen to us. This is toxic. We are in a toxic relationship, Elena. I just killed your friend and you find someone else to blame. You want me to blame you? Easy. Done. You screwed up, Damon. Again. Thank you. You put me in a position where I have to defend you. Again. Where I have to bend my morals. Again. Where I have to go against every single thing that I believe in. Again. Because I love you. Then stop loving me. I can't! Well, that's the problem. We don't work! I know. Then we agree. This has to end. It just did. It's over. We're over
