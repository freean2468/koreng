Gone Girl



                    			Previously on "The Vampire Diaries" Wes had this scheme to destroy vampires by making them feed on each other. - What's happening to you? - Karma is happening to me. My name is Nadia Petrova. You are my mother. This knife's the only thing that will kill a passenger. I passengered myself into Elena's cute, little head. She's acting strange. She kissed me. Matt texted "help K," as in "Katherine." Oh, my God. You won't have to worry about me for much longer. Tyler Lockwood bit me. Good evening, sir. If I could trouble you for a moment. I'm looking for someone. Her name is Katerina Petrova. She was last seen outside of London in 1492. She's on the run. I need to find her. I need to ask her why she abandoned me. Nadia? Please. I need to know. Nadia, I'm right here. I'm right here. Uhh. I was dreaming how I searched for you from village to village. I know. I heard you. You said that I abandoned you. You were ripped from my arms as a baby. It's completely different. Not for a child without a mother. You know, all this guilt is really taking all the fun out of this mother-daughter outing. I'm sorry Tyler bit you, but you're not going to die. Did you ask Klaus for his blood? Oh, my, you really are delirious. Nadia, he would love nothing more than to watch my daughter die. And you don't want to risk being outed. No, I don't. So, that's why I called him. Nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maxfield. And luckily for us, he'll love nothing more than to study your blood. Werewolf venom isn't easy to come by. Get away from me. It's ok. Nadia, it's ok. Listen to your mother. The venom in your blood is a toxin with basic chemical properties. Once I study its make-up, I can Create the antidote. It's ok. Come on, come on, honey. There you go. If I'd known I just had to die to drag your attention from Stefan, I would have tried it a long time ago. If you're trying to make me feel guilty It's almost working. I'm just glad you're here now. Me, too. I'm going to be a better mother, starting right now. I promise you I'm going to save your life. she's brilliant. We haven't noticed that Katherine's been inhabiting. Elena's body for weeks, and that's all you have to say? Yep. And you realize that it was Katherine who broke up with you, it wasn't Elena. Mm-hmm. Right. So, your little murder spree with Enzo where you killed Aaron, you nearly killed Jeremy, tried to kill Wes but you got infected with that ripper virus That was all you reacting to Katherine. I'm trying to figure out why you decided to tell a starving, bloodthirsty, vampire-feeding ripper that his Nemesis is still walking around alive and well while I am stuck in this cell and can't do anything about it. I have it under control. I'd love to hear this. Hang on here. Katherine's still alive? How is that even possible? Remember that time Nadia's ex Gregor hitched a ride in your head? Ok, well, it's kind of the same thing. Katherine is a passenger in Elena, except it's worse because none of us seemed to notice. She was at my house. How did none of us figure it out? Because it's Katherine, and she's smart, and conniving and sneaky and We're the worst friends ever. This makes no sense. She saved my life. She gave me CPR when Enzo tried to kill me. Katherine would never do that. That's what made her so believable. She played Elena to a t. If she let you die, her cover was blown. I was sleeping She picked out my bitter ball dress. And I let her use my toothpaste. Yeah, well, did she lure you into a hotel room to make out with you? She's the reason I found out about you and Klaus. Of course. Oh, my God. So, how do we kill the bitch? Well, passengers can be expelled from the host. Saw it happen with Matt. Gregor died and Matt lived. All we have to do is stab her with a traveler knife. I still have the knife that Nadia gave me. Perfect. Go get it. Hold on, guys, this is Katherine that we're talking about. She's gonna see a sneak attack coming from a mile away. We gotta get her to come to us. Get her guard down. Corner her. Fat chance you'll be seeing her today. I'm pretty sure I bit Nadia. What do you mean you bit her? I mean she was attacking Caroline and I might've nipped her a little. And you're just mentioning this now? Hey, guys, focus. Tyler's right. Katherine is not going to leave Nadia's side unless not leaving compromises her identity. Which means? We gotta invite her to something that Elena can't say no to. A surprise party? Seriously? I wanted a spa day. You try feeling the death of every supernatural creature who passes through you on their way to the other side. I'm not saying you don't deserve it. Besides, your birthday isn't until next week. That's what makes it a surprise. Yeah, I don't think Bonnie would want a big party for her birthday. Of course she does. So, when can you get over to Stefan's to help us set up? I can't. You can't. I would love to, but I just I can't. Um I'm making arrangements for Aaron Whitmore's funeral. The only reason Damon killed him was because we broke up, so, I kind of feel like I owe it to Aaron. You understand, right? Of course. No, that's really nice of you. Elena, you're so popular today. Hey, Bonnie. Hey. How's it going? You sound tired. Yeah. I had to pull an all-nighter for my sociology exam and then woke up to a coven of dead Russian witches passing through me on the way to the other side. Sorry. Self-pity. So not cute. No, I totally get it. You're the anchor now. That must be exhausting. Do you want to maybe meet up for a coffee or something? It's just been one of those days, you know? Yeah. Well, ha! This is gonna sound crazy, but I'm actually at the day spa right now buying you a gift certificate for your birthday. It was supposed to be a surprise but, well, surprise! You read my mind. That's so you. Hey, look, I'll check in with you later. Ok. Why are they being so clingy today? What are you doing? There you go. Drink. I need more. Too bad. That was nothing. That's exactly 4 ounces. When you were out killing vampires, you said one vampire kept you good for 8 hours. So, our friend Caroline did a little bit of math Caroline? Relax. She had a calculator. So, 4 ounces 3 times a day should be just enough to help manage the hunger. You mean manage me. So you don't rip anyone's head off. We'll deal with your crisis once we get Elena back. I'll deal with my own crisis. Listen, you just let me out of here. I'll find Wes, I'll get the antidote. And then what, huh? You skip town? Leave it to me to tell Elena everything you did after you thought she broke up with you? Who are you calling there, buddy? Katherine's been making a lot of excuses and I have a feeling she won't be able to say no to me. It's your phone. Elena is calling. Answer it. Elena. Hey. Hey. Um how are you? Well, you know. Strung up, hungry. Same old, same old. Now that the dust has settled, I was hoping that, I don't know, maybe we can talk about what happened at the farmhouse. Can I see you? Ok. Sure. Why don't you just come to the house and we'll talk about it here? Perfect. I'll see you soon. Ok. Bye. Damon knows that he tried to kill me less than 24 hours ago. There isn't a single vampire-craving bone in his body that would risk putting his precious Elena back in that kind of danger again. And yet he's desperate to see her. Just like her other friends. They know. Doesn't make any sense. She's dodged everyone's attempt to try to get her over here. Now she voluntarily wants to come over? Unless Unless? She was testing me. She knows. Money for information. I was told you saw Katerina Petrova kill a man in cold blood outside the court of versailles. I want to know if that's true. I want to know what kind of person my mother is. She's been on the run for 228 years. You passed out in the car. I didn't want to wake you. Huh. Perfect. I can make my peace with the universe. Don't talk like that. I brought you here so that I could hide you till Wes finds a way to heal you. You should leave now. While you can. There's no point in trying to save me. I didn't raise you to be a quitter. And I promise As soon as you get better, we're leaving. Together. Of course. The farther she gets, the worse our chances are of ever seeing Elena again. It's bad enough that we didn't recognize Katherine. We also just blew our only advantage. Nothing a little locator spell can't fix. Let me guess. Matter of life and death? Kind of. Yeah, um, do you remember that locator spell we did the other night? Sure. We ended up saving him. You're welcome, by the way. Now we need you to find his sister. Why? She run away from home? No. She's been possessed by her evil doppelganger. Ok Liv. Will you help us? I can be convinced. Need blood. You just had your lunch Or you could give me a couple sips of that hybrid juice. I can be on my way and I'll take up my ripper situation with Wes. Not gonna happen. Can I ask you a question without you getting all wolf man on me? Do I have a choice? Why are you still here? I'm a hybrid and you need a baby-sitter. Oh, no, I mean here here, in Mystic Falls here. Your famila's all dead and I don't see you getting a job at the Grill. Yet I don't see you in a Whitmore hoodie, either. Something tells me that there's a little masochistic voice inside your head that's trying to convince you that you and Caroline still have a fighting chance in hell. I think you have enough problems without having to worry about me. You're probably right. One small difference between you and me - You want to hear it? - Not especially. You see, even after all the terrible things I do, Elena still chose me. Because she's fighting for me. Caroline, on the other hand, chose the nuclear option. You know that big, red button that just nukes your entire relationship once and for all? Well, sleeping with the guy that killed your mom was kind of her way of slamming her hand down. You think Elena will still want you back after this? It's over, Damon. Fix yourself and run. Far away. I plan on it. How's New Orleans this time of year? You really think Elena's gonna forgive you? Look at you. You killed her friend. You almost killed her brother. You nearly killed her. You're a joke, Damon. Says the guy pining after the girl who slept with Klaus. You don't know anything about me. I know how to get you in this cell. Ooh! Aah! Hey, ready for a changing of the guard Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Tyler? - I'm ok. - He fed on you? - I said I'm fine. - Why would you come in here? - Why do you think? Damon knew exactly how to piss me off. What the hell happened? I think Damon went to go find Wes. Elena's necklace. Candle. Map. Give me your hand. You're Elena's brother. That makes you blood. So, hand it over. Actually, he's her cousin. It's a long story. Whatever. Close enough. That's not That's not how I taught you. Relax, Mr. Miyagi. I'm feeling my way through it, ok? Now, what do I say, again? Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinem. Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinem. Does Elena look anything like you? Uh, same color hair. What about her eyes? Are they as pretty as yours? Is this really necessary? I'm sorry. I'm searching for his sister/cousin's doppelganger in my mind. I'll take all the help I can get. Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinem. Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinem. Does your sister spend a lot of time in church? Are you leaving? I'm going to check on Wes. He's taking too long. Be careful. They're all out looking for you. That's never stopped me before. Huh. Hello? What's up, doc? How did you find me? I called my friend Enzo and asked him about the little adventure he had with you. Gotta say, long way off the tenure track, huh? Huh. I take it the Augustine society hit a bit of a rough streak. There is no Augustine society, Damon. It's just me. Well, then I guess you're my guy. You see, I have this long road ahead of me to win my ex-girlfriend back. But I don't have a chance in hell if I'm lusting over her blood. Follow? Even if I did cure you of this virus, what difference does it make? So you stop feeding on your friends and go back to feeding on innocent people. Is that really gonna impress Elena Gilbert? Look at me. You did this to me. I didn't do this to you. You are this. I simply held up the mirror. Now it's my turn to play doctor. That was fun. You think? You must really trust Rebekah. Huh? Watch this. I'm going to steal her earrings And you're not going to say anything. See? You're hanging out with an original vampire and you're not even on vervain. Trust. You know she's an original? I recognized her on the dance floor. I was hoping she'd know something about her brother Klaus' favorite vampire: Katherine Pierce. Maybe you heard of her? Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of her. I know her. Why do you care? Because she is my mother, and I'd very much like to meet her. I'm going to take your ring. Now I have a reason to see you again. Wes? What the hell is taking so I No. No. Please, no. No. Nadia, I'm coming back to the church right now. She's not at the church anymore. She's with me at home. Stefan, why do you have Nadia's phone? She doesn't have much time left, Katherine. I don't know what you're talking about. I know that it's you and I know that you care about Nadia. That's why I brought her here. Prove it. Put her on the phone. Katherine? Run. You can always run, Katherine. It's what you do best. Or you can come home and see your daughter one last time before she dies. It's your choice. Your hands are like ice. Gregor. No, it's Matt. I'm not Gregor, I'm sorry I betrayed you. I did it for my mother. I did everything for her. I know you did. Forgive me? Yes. I forgive you. Hey, hey. Shh. It's ok. It's ok. Shh. I I don't want to die. I don't want to die. What's gonna happen when I die? I'll take your hand And you'll go to the other side. Just like that. Will it hurt? You won't feel any pain. I'm here to see my daughter. Nadia. You came back for me. I won't leave you again. Did you find a way to save me? Klaus' blood would've saved you If I'd asked for it. You would have outed yourself. But you would've been alive. And now it's too late. My mother's name is Katherine. I'm looking for her. You found me. Nadia, I'm right here. She's a liar. And a murderer. She manipulates. She betrays. She will do anything to survive. Nadia. No, I'm I'm right here. Nadia, look at me. Look at me. I'm here. I'm right here. I'm looking for my mother. This is not what your life should've been. who ended up  being me. Let me show you what your life should've been. What your perfect day would have been like. You and I had a little cottage. It was an ordinary summer day. You'd been playing outside. So, you were tired and it was time for bed. You told me about the fort that you'd built. Out in the woods by the river. And so I asked if I could visit. And you said when the sun came up in the morning, and I said Good night, Nadia. Sleep well. Your mother loves you. Uhh! So. This is it. Hello, Katherine. You didn't think I'd miss this, did you? Ok. So. Who's got the knife? Which one of you is gonna get to kill the elusive Katherine Pierce once and for all? What? Suddenly everyone's speechless? When I was on my deathbed, you all had plenty to say. Is it you, Tyler? Because I triggered the werewolf curse? Gave you an identity and made you matter? You've done nothing for me. Oh, please, Tyler. If I hadn't walked into your life, you'd just be a wasted nobody with a boozy mom and a temper problem. Don't. Don't. And you. I'm not worried about you offing me. Because we both know I made you better by making you a vampire. Good-bye, Katherine. Bye-bye, Caroline. Ooh. The one girl here who actually appreciates how beautiful you are. You wouldn't stab me in the heart, would you? No, I don't think so. You will definitely go down as the best night I never had. - Oh, well. - Oh, well. Well, little Gilbert, it was nice to have a brother for a second there. When you weren't being so damn annoying! Bon Bon, no need for good-byes. I'll see you on the flip side. Damon. Oh, how you'd love nothing more than to drive that blade right through me. We've already done this, Kitty Kat. I've said all I needed to say. I know, but I never got to say what I needed to say to you. I'm sorry. You blame me for who you are. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I turned you. I'm sorry that you didn't get to die as a forgotten nobody on a bloody battlefield, and your father didn't get to live another day to be disgraced by you. Damon, I'm sorry that I gave your life purpose. Passion. Drive. Desire. I'm sorry that you are who you are because I'm the one that taught you how to love. I'll see you in hell, Katherine. Stefan. You know, I always wondered what it would be like to be loved by you. You've got to admit, that one fleeting moment Your feelings were real. This truly has been the role of a lifetime. Stefan, I love you. I've always loved you. Mmf. Uhh. I guess this is how Our love story ends. Stefan said we should bury her in the woods. Screw that. She deserves better. You need some help? No. I got this. Why is she not waking up? When Gregor left Matt's body, it took him a while to wake up, too. Which gives us a little bit of time to talk about what the hell you did. Relax. Thanks to Tyler's friendly donation, I'll be fine for a couple hours. A few hours, huh? And then what? What's the plan? Tell her everything I did. Let the chips crash and burn where they may. Optimistic. I don't want to be another Katherine Pierce. Katherine spent her whole life running from her problems only to die here. All alone. - Is it wrong that I feel - Victorious? Sad. I know that Katherine is a horrible person, but But you see the good in people. You mean Klaus. Because I saw the good in Klaus. Your words. Not mine. Your hybrid bite just killed someone and no one even batted an eye. I sleep with the wrong guy weeks ago and I don't hear the end of it. - How is that fair? - I don't know, Care. Maybe people just expect more from you. Why? Because being good comes so easy to me? Well, guess what, Tyler? It doesn't. I am a vampire. I have the same impulses as you. So, I'm allowed to make some mistakes along the way. Yes, I slept with Klaus But after you walked away from me. That was my choice and I am living with it and I don't need to be hearing about it every 5 seconds. So, just get over it or get out of my life, but I'm done feeling guilty. This is for you, dad. I want you to know how much I miss you. You've got to be kidding me, right? Something tells me I'm about 5 centuries delayed on the whole believing in a higher power thing. Well, you're here. That means it worked. You're dead. True. Then again, your friends didn't really give me much of a choice in the matter. Using my only daughter against me? Harsh. I suppose I could've spent the next My daughter was dying. Stefan would never love me. I was back to having nothing. Elena wins again. Let's get this over with. I'm really starting to get sick of Elena getting everything that I want. What is that supposed to mean? Wes had no intention of helping Nadia. You can always run, Katherine. It's your choice. Uhh! A good day. I've managed to extract the werewolf venom from Nadia Petrova's blood. The addition of the venom will make the ripper virus even more lethal to vampires. He was just using her as a case study in his project to wipe out vampires off the face of the earth. Why are you telling me this? Hey. Elena? I've said it before and I'll say it again. Elena had the life I always wanted. Heh. Well, until now. Katherine, what did you do? Stefan thought he gave me a choice: Run or die. But that's not really much of a choice, is it? After all, Nadia was the only person in this world who really loved me. And I wasn't about to let my daughter die alone. But Katherine Pierce wasn't about to go gentle, either. Hi. Are you you? Yeah. Yeah, it's me. I'm here. I left Elena with a little bit of a parting gift. If I can't have Stefan, then no one can. Ok. Now I'm ready. Nothing's happening. What's wrong? I don't know. This has never happened before. Bonnie, what are you doing? Let me pass through. Why won't you let me pass through? I don't know. I don't control it. - What? - It's not up to me. Then who is it up to? - Bonnie. - I can't help you, Katherine. What no, no no! Nooooo!
