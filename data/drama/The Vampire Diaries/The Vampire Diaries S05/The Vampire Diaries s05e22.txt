                    			Previously on "The Vampire Diaries" Being around you drives me nuts, and not being around you drives me nuts. You two are miserable without each other, so if you want to be with him, just be with him. I'm sorry, but we need to make the doppelganger blood useless. - One of you needs to die. - Luke, the spell's started. The spell will continue to unravel spirit magic as it spreads. The other side is collapsing, and everyone in it, including me, is going away. Don't let go! I plan on pestering all of you until I'm safely returned to the land of the living. Welcome back, Julian. My wife's dead, I'm in somebody else's body, I've got nowhere to go because my own people are trying to kill me. There. Dead doppelganger. - Oh, my God. - Stopped the spell. Somebody, help! No. Oh, my God. Stefan! I didn't know where to bring him, and I just couldn't leave him outside. Bonnie has a plan, right? She she said that she could bring people back. Tell me that she can bring him back! We'll bring him back. Come on. Let's get away from prying eyes. Ok. I got you! Looks like I've now saved you from both metaphorical darkness and actual darkness. I think you owe me a beer. Damon, stop! You said you had a plan, Bonnie. I did. I had a traveler who knew the right spell. - And you lost her. - I didn't lose her. She was sucked into oblivion like everyone else on the other side. - Then find another one! - It's more than just knowing the spell. Markos was able to come back because dozens of travelers were willing to sacrifice themselves in order to overwhelm me. I doubt they'll be willing to do that for a bunch of supernatural strangers. You know who needs motivation? You need motivation because if the other side goes away, everyone we know there, including you, - goes away with it. - I know that. Do you think I want to die? - My brother is over there. - I know that. So is Alaric, and so is your grams. I know that, Damon. Ahem. Let's not forget who else is at the top of the search and rescue list. Enzo's here. Well, if it's not. Mr. Butterfingers himself. How'd it feel to have your only hope of coming back literally slip through your fingers? Hello to you, too, grumpy pants. Tell him to play nice. I have a plan. Are you serious? You found another traveler? - Well, then get on it! - I'm already on it, mate. You still need someone to do this coming back from the dead spell. I assume you still have a witch or two in your pocket. More or less. Oh, great. Grandma just passed us. If you want to drive, just say so. No. I want you to drive, just at a speed more fitting for two people who just tried to commit murder. They are not following us. Markos stripped the town of spirit magic. There's no way they survived it. Something tells me they did. And I bet if I turn around Using our own tricks against us. Jerks. A little tip. If you're gonna flee the scene of the crime, take back roads. You really want to do this again? You mean the part where you try to kill a doppelganger? There's no point. Stefan's already dead. I know you don't believe me, but I am sorry. Good because you're gonna help bring him back. Look. I get what you need from us, but if both doppelgangers are alive again, the travelers can restart their spell. Witch magic goes bye-bye, and all you vamps, you're goners. They're not gonna have a chance to start again because in order to bring Stefan back, we're gonna have to kill them, - a lot of them, including Markos. - We can't help you. Even if we wanted to, our coven would kill us. Stefan saved your life. - I know he did, but - We can't risk it. No! Your brother's officially on the other side. Think you can risk it now? It is a good day, sheriff. Maybe for you. It took me all night to evacuate the 10-mile civilian radius around the town square. Hmm. Gas leak. Very clever. I appreciate your cooperation. It will keep our residents away for now but certainly not forever. I'm sure we can think of something if we put our heads together. Why did they move our sign? Our desire was to end spirit magic everywhere. As you can see, we hit a snag. Nevertheless, this is our home now, and just to keep things simple, we've reset the official border of Mystic Falls to where the spell begins, right there. Of all the small towns to call home, you probably shouldn't have picked one full of vampires. You think I'm afraid of vampires? Maybe you think your friend Damon or your daughter can come save the day. Let me give an example of why that would be unwise. Tyler! Oh, that's not Tyler anymore. That's Julian, the traveler who betrayed his people when he killed the doppelganger and stopped the spell. A big, scary werewolf-vampire hybrid, and yet a little vervain, a touch of wolfsbane, and here you are Weak and all mine. You think you're some great leader because you pillage a helpless town? That makes you King now? Sorry, your highness, but I don't buy it. That's because you haven't set foot inside my kingdom. The spell the travelers cast across Mystic Falls eliminates spirit magic, so while my people continue to have access to the earth's purest magic, your friend Tyler will be stripped of everything the witches did to him, first his hybrid side, then his vampirism, and with no vampirism to keep him alive, he'll just be a boy with a werewolf gene, who happened to break his neck. No, no! No! Don't do this! No! No! Stop. Please don't! Don't! No! Aah! Aah! Ohh! Aagh! Oh, my God. Ohh! One less witch twin in the world. No. One more person we need to bring back. This list is getting uncomfortably long. Tell me about it, but with Liv doing the spell, not bring her brother back would be just Smart, savvy? Cruel. It would be cruel, but none of it matters if your mysterious traveler doesn't show. Bonnie? Tyler, is that you? How the hell did I get here? You're dead, and you're you. Caroline was right. - Dying eliminated your passenger. - Hang on. - Did you say I'm dead? - I did, but we can bring you back. And the list keeps growing. I need you to trust me, ok? Do I have a choice? Aah! Class is in session. First assignment Anti-magic perimeter. Gilbert, what do you got? I walked around Mystic Falls this morning to see where my hunter instincts disappeared. Meaning what, your biceps shrunk, and your brain got smaller? Meaning that I have a supernatural urge to kill vampires, so wherever I hated you less, there was no magic. The cemetery's outside of the no-magic perimeter, a couple unpopulated other than that. Hey, Professor Salvatore, not everyone can see the map. Yeah, don't forget about us. Donovan, you had one job. I'll send you a picture right now. We should be there. Nope. You should not be. You are on witch duty because without crazy locks, no one's rising from the dead. So next order of business, mass murder. Quarterback? Thank you. Ok. We got these from the sheriff. Apparently there was some truth to her evacuation story. There's a major gas line that runs underneath the town. Now if it did leak, it could be deadly, as in massive explosion kind of deadly. We can't blow up our hometown. Says one of the only people left in this group who can actually live there. We're not blowing up our town. We just need to lure enough travelers to one spot. How? We can't lure anyone anywhere stuck out here. And that's where your mama comes in. She will convince them to gather somewhere inside. Meanwhile, these two geniuses at 7:00 will turn on the gas, let it leak. We'll have about 10 minutes before anyone can smell it. You clear out. Boom! Travelers gone, resurrection spell starts, loved ones return. Good? Good? Class dismissed. Huh. I thought for sure he'd be here. If you were a history teacher turned vampire, where else would you be? You seem very intent on finding somebody you barely know. Well, I have a thing for day drinkers. Plus he has a cute name. Alaric. Hmm. We'll find him. Seriously? This is what I have to look forward to when I come back to life, all-you-can-eat potato skins? Remind me again why you never made it to Portland. I was attacked by Silas and locked in a safe to drown for 3 months. Right, and then you made it out, and yet you're still here. Lexi, either one of us could blink out existence any second, so if you have something to say to me Caroline. What about Caroline? Wow! You really don't see it, do you? See what? Listen. I might not carry a lot of weight with you people, but I am still the sheriff, and I still represent the people who live here. Travelers haven't been able to gather together for centuries. The last thing they'll tolerate is a list of your ground rules. What if there's an open bar? She's trying to gather the travelers. They're planning something. I should go with you. You need to go be a younger, hotter Bruce Willis, and if I take one step into Mystic Falls, good-bye magic, good-bye anchor, good-bye me. At least tell me how this works. Being an anchor is like being a gateway. Usually, it's one way, but when the travelers die, Liv will do the spell, and her magic combined with all those travelers opening the gate at once will allow the people on the other side to push their way through me like Markos did. What about you? What happens? I stop being the anchor. Yeah, but how do you get through? Jeremy, I will be fine. Look. I got to go, ok? Be careful. What is your plan exactly? My plan is my job just like the spell is yours, which apparently you suck at. Should already be on the road. I'm late, aren't I? My bad. I was watching some 80-year-old witch get dragged off to never, never land. It was, uh It was weirdly entertaining. - Stefan. - Not exactly. Bonnie, meet the traveler with our one-way ticket out of here, although you may know him better an ancient immortal with a desperate need of a cure. Oh, my God. Silas. You killed my dad. And now I'm gonna help you bring your friends back to life and me along with them. So what do you say? Bygones? Where in the hell is Alaric? I don't know. Maybe he finally found peace, although if he did, - I'm gonna be superpissed he beat me. - Well, why didn't you? I mean, if anyone was gonna find peace, it should be you. I don't know. Maybe there's something I'm still supposed to do, you know, like, earn my stripes. All right. Let's make a deal. If all this fails and you and I are stuck over here, we're not gonna let whatever's happening to these people happen to us. - We're gonna find peace together. - A death peace pact? I like it. Come on. Let's go. I would hate for you to miss your come-back-to-life window before you even had your first date with Caroline. Oh, shut it. As vezat esvet. As vezat esvat. Esvet, not vat. I feel like I'm teaching calculus to an infant. I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous about unleashing a plague onto humanity. Ooh! I've been upgraded a plague? Oh. How biblical and fitting, seeing as I probably will kill a lot of people in an epic, all-inclusive way once I'm out of here. Oh, speaking of, how is my shadow self? Is it a crime for someone so good-looking to be so sad all the time? Just teach me the damn spell. Hey. Did you find a traveler that's gonna get us out of here? Yep. Learning the spell as we speak. I'd introduce you, but, um Thank you, whoever you are. Oh, just the perfect specimen of man, that's all. Moody old lady. Kind of senile. Got it. Well, I'm gonna go call Damon and let him know that we're ready. Can we talk about the irony in us blowing up the only place dumb enough to hire us? I'm sure the Salvatores will make a generous contribution to help fix it. Yeah, if they can come home. No one said killing the travelers would get rid of this anti-magic thing, although Mystic Falls might be a half-decent place to live again. No more vampire attacks, crazy blood rituals, you know? Safe like it used to be. Except I wouldn't be able to invite my girlfriend over. There are worse things than having to visit your girlfriend at college on the weekends, Jer. It's called normal. We're here. I warned you they probably wouldn't give you the chance to speak. Well, they don't seem to have a problem with the free food. Where are you going? Well, I'm clearly not gonna have much of an impact here, so I think it's time I take my own orders and evacuate. We're not lawless, you know? We could use someone like you. Have a drink with me. Allow me to convince you this can sill be your home. My home is a place my daughter can come visit. Good-bye. Please. I insist. - So you good? - Operation massacre. Assuming Donovan knows the difference between a water main and a gas main, yeah, I'm good. Listen. I wanted to spare you the gory details, and then I figured, "well, I'll be lying, "and then the whole point of saving the universe would be moot because you'd be pissed," so here it is. Project Kaboom needs someone to trigger the explosion, so to speak. Ok. Wait. You? No! Damon, no. Absolutely not, no. Go with your first instinct, Damon. Lesson learned. Look at me. Damon Do you see a future with me? Because that's all I see. Elena, I've seen it since the second I laid eyes on you. Then don't go on a suicide mission. Listen. Technically, it's only have a suicide mission because we're gonna be bringing people back from the other side, and I'm gonna be with them. Well, then what if something goes wrong? All right. Not to relive old fights, but this is my choice, and I need you to respect it. That was a low blow. Hey. I will make it back to you, I promise. I promise you. Everything all right in there? We're good. Silas is a crappy mentor, fyi. It's back. She's ready. Let's get on with it. Unh! Help me. Bygones. Aah! Ohto eestenay as vazat. Esvet ohnaz eespalit. You can do this, Liv. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Esvet ohnaz eespalit. All right. It's 7:00 on the dot. Let's go. Come on, grams. Where are you? Didn't I teach you not to rush your elders? We move a little slower. Thank God. I found us all a way out. Think I was born yesterday? I know what you're doing. You cannot survive all these people coming through you. When it's all said and done, you're still the anchor, and when this place goes away - I know what you're about to say. - No, you don't. I was going to say that it's been my privilege to watch you grow into the beautiful woman you've become. You need to pass through me when the ritual begins. No. I'm staying here. Grams, you can't. This place is imploding and taking everyone with it. I can't come, Bonnie. You're not the only member of this family who knows how to make a sacrifice. What does that mean? It means that I'm gonna be fine. I found peace because I made sure that you'll find yours. I don't understand. Not your concern. Just know I looked out for you. I love you, Bonnie. You stay strong. I love you. Third phone call in 5 minutes. Look. What am I doing here? You know, I was wondering the same thing. You evacuated the town, yet you stayed to lecture us on our civic duties? Captain goes down with the ship. Or you're up to something. Do you smell gas? I think there's a leak coming from the hatch. What are you doing? You said to respect your choice, and I did. Now you can respect mine. Whoa, no. No, no. That not how this works, Elena. The second we cross that border, you're gonna feel everything. You're gonna drown all over again, it's gonna take you back to the night you died a human. I know what I signed up for, Damon, and I'm all in. What are you staring at? Drive. Hurry. We have to die while we're still vampires No. No! Come on! - Damon - I know. I know. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Esvet ohnaz eespalit. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Just keep going. You can do it. Esvet ohnaz eespalit. We meet again. We can do this all day, Bonnie. Your friends kill me, and I come right back through you. I look forward to the deja vu. Aah! Esvet ohnaz eespalit. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Ohh! Bonnie! Elena! Did it work? Are you Yes. Did Damon Right here. Ok. When you guys pass through me, you're gonna wake up with your bodies on the other side. You need to get back here as fast as you can. Did you seriously wear your seat belt? Oh, my God. Alaric, what are you Come on. We got to go. But wait. What about Damon? I need to find him. No. You need to go home to your brother. I'll find Damon. - I can - Now come on. Elena, get out of here. Go. Ok. Liz. No. No, no, no. Come on. Friendly advice. When you finally get the girl, don't blow her up. Good to see you, too, buddy. Yeah. She's gonna be ok. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Esvet ohnaz eespalit. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Bonnie. Bonnie! Bonnie! Hey! Look. It's too much for her! We need to start now! No, no. We all go together. Damon's not here yet. I don't care. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Esvet ohnaz eespalit. Hey. Liv. Liv. Hey. Hey. Look. You need to stop now, ok? If you keep going, it's gonna kill you. No. I promised that I'd help them. Ohto eestenay as vazat. You need to come through! What about everyone else? You don't have to tell me twice. Aah! Phew. Ah. See you around, gorgeous. Tyler? Yeah. It's me. Oh! Whoa! What's wrong? That felt different. What do you mean? W-wha You're not healing. I'm not a hybrid anymore. Come on, guys. We don't have much time. Grab my hand! Go. Go! You have to go. Come on! I can't find Damon. You go, I'll wait here. No. I'm not leaving without him! This place is falling apart. No! Elena! Thank God! No, Bonnie. Why would you do that? I can't leave without him. We'll find him. What? What's going on? Who are we missing? Where's Stefan? You ok? Oh, my God. Bonnie? No. No, no. No. Stefan! - I was just trying to - What's wrong? - She fell. I was just trying to - What?! - Damon he's not there yet. - This isn't happening. It's ok. I can do this. Bonnie! This is killing you, isn't it? I can hold on. I have to. Just come through. We have to finish this. Not just yet! Unh! Aah! Lexi! Come on! It's your turn. Every person that passes through takes you one step closer to death. What kind of a best friend would I be if you died before Stefan got his brother back? You're not gonna get me. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Esvet ohnaz eespalit. Ohto eestenay as vazat. Esvet ohnaz eespalit. Bonnie! Thank God. Screw those guys. I won't let you die for them. Phasmatos fumas extas. Where's Elena? - She made it through. - Ok. Come on. Well, would you look at that? Oh, my God. Liv! No, no, no, no. Bonnie, we need to find them. We need to start the spell again. We can't. That was our one shot. Yeah, but but Damon's on the other side. - We have to - Elena! It It It's too late. No. No. He's here. You can say good-bye. I lost them both. Two people I've known longest in this world, both gone. Lexi? She never came out. Neither did Markos. I know that's not a coincidence. It was her, uh, unfinished business. And Damon, uh Finally had everything he wanted. He was happy. He should be here. You lied to me. Even if I wanted to apologize, you couldn't hear me, so I won't. Please don't leave me. I don't have a choice, baby. You are by far the greatest thing that ever happened to me in my 173-years on this earth. The fact that I get to die knowing that I was loved, not just by anyone, by you, Elena Gilbert, is the epitome of a fulfilled life. It's never gonna get any better than this. I peaked. I love you, Elena. Please. Please come back to me. Bye. It was all a lie. There was never a way for me to stop being the anchor. When the other side goes, I go with it. You told me you could come back. If I would have told you the truth, it would have changed our last days together, and I didn't want it to change. We were happy. So none of it was true? Bonnie Don't move, ok? I'm coming to you. I died, Jer. I died the day before our graduation, and the rest of this has been a gift, and I choose to be thankful that I didn't waste a second of it. So Take care of Elena. No! No. Don't you dare hang up on me. - I love you. - Bonnie, Bonnie, don't you dare. Main gas line's off, Jer. Jer? I need to get to, Bonnie. He's gone. Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! What's going on? Bonnie! Bonnie! Bonnie! - This place is going down, isn't it? - It is. I'm sure there are a million people we'd both rather be with right now, but Couple thousand at most. Do you think it will hurt? I don't know
