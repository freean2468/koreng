Death and the Maiden



                    			 Previously on "The Vampire Diaries" I'm Elena. I'm Stefan. Love brought me to Mystic Falls, love drove me away. I love you, Damon. Silas. Hello, my shadow self. Bonnie's dead, Elena. I can't believe she's gone. We'll do anything to protect the people we love Katherine, he needs your blood to cure himself. No. Aah! Silas, you said that now you're a witch again you would bring Bonnie back from the other side. I did. She's a freaky carbon copy of my one true love Amara. I have to be cured. Amara's been cured, so the fate of the other side, rests on a living, breathing human being that we now need to protect. You ever been in love? Love. Hello, you two. Yeah. We're together, in love. Aw, that's so adorable. I love love. I do. Yeah. I have a soul mate, too, you know, that love at first sight, want to live forever, love is eternal kind of love? Amara. That's her name. See, the problem is when I first met Amara, I was with another woman, so I kind of cheated on her, which to be honest with you, it really wouldn't have been that big of a deal except it turned out that the other woman was a raging lunatic, so when she found out that I cheated on her, she freaked out, turned Amara into stone, like, literally, Medusa style. Dude, are you, like, ok? What do you mean? You think I'm crazy? Why do you think I'm crazy? All I've wanted for the last 2,000 years. Is to be reunited with the love of my life. How's that crazy? Maybe the turned her to stone part. Or the 2,000 years part. No. Guys, we were both immortal, and now we're not. Hello? Look. The point is I finally had the chance to hold Amara in my arms, and what does she do? She jams a chunk of glass into my carotid artery. Look, look. No, thanks. Listen, you two. Here's my advice. Live it up. You know, enjoy this love while it lasts because let me tell you something. Just a couple days ago, I was psychic, I was immortal, I was in love. Now my neck hurts, my soul is crushed, I'm sitting in a bus stop in frigging Delaware. You're in Philly. I'm in Philly? Ohh! God, it's even worse. Ow! What's going on, babe? Hey. What's going on? Hey. Talk to me. Oh, my God. What's happening ? What are you doing to him? I think I'm liquefying his internal organs. Did I fail to mention that I'm a witch? Please stop. Please just stop. No! I'm pissed off at the world, and I'm taking it out on your so-called lover. Oh, my God! And I'm thinking you might be my next victim. Oh, my God! Look at that. Unbelievable. Love is so damn fickle. Incredible. Here you go, buddy. Come on up. Come on up, come on up, come on up. Up you go. That's good, good. Buses, however Tried and true. Hello, my shadow self. Unh! Silas. Stop! Aah! Stefan. Morning. I made coffee. How did you sleep? Ohhnot great. First night back in your own bed. Not as comfy as Tessa's couch, huh? If we're gonna talk about Tessa, I think I need that caffeine. So, uh, what's with the wakeup call? I miss you. I feel like when you lost your memories I lost a friend, and I was thinking instead of describing how much we meant to each other, maybe we can just start fresh Hi. I'm Elena. I was driving to Portland. What? The night I took Silas to the quarry, I said good-bye to Lexi, and then I decided to keep driving west. Wait. Hang on. How do you remember that? Because my memories are back. Really? Are you serious? How? Tessa came here last night, and she undid whatever spell fried my brain, and it's all back. I can remember everything. Stefan, this is great! This is amazing. October 1852. You broke my nose trying to teach me how to throw a right hook. But not on purpose just to be clear. How much did you pay for that hunk of junk motorcycle that you ride? That's a trick question. You bought me that motorcycle, although I'm guessing it was pretty expensive. So Tessa just gave you back your memories, no strings attached. Well, it wasn't exactly a gift. It was a lot to take in all at once, everything from blowing out the candles on my first birthday cake to drowning in a safe. Stefan. Whoa! Easy there, buddy. Stefan, where did you go? Uhall of that, and I still can't remember my own strength. Hmm. What was that noise? Uh, well that is-- We have a situation. Of the doppelganger variety. Yeah. Katherine? No, nope, not Katherine. I don't know! I don't know. What's wrong with her? Tessa turned her into a block of rock, left her in a box for 2,000 years, probably went a little stir crazy like those deserted island guys who talk to volleyballs. I said I don't know! So you're telling me that this girl is the only thing holding together the other side? Yep. She's the anchor. Leave me alone. As long as she's alive, the other side exists, and we can keep trying to get Bonnie from over there. I said I don't know! Well, considering she's immortal, I'd say we have plenty of opportunity. You'd think, except last night she stuck a hole in Silas' neck, sucked the cure right out of him, so now she's not only nuts, but she's mortal, which means we have to keep her ordinary little human heart beating until we get Bonnie back. How would you plan to do that? Silas made a pinky promise that he'd do a spell to bring her back. Unfortunately, he's taking his sweet time coming back to Mystic Falls. Eh, Amara, stop! No! No! Let me die. I want to die! Let's hope love is blind or at least deaf. It turns out that it's not gonna be that easy to keep Amara alive. I wonder what will happen if she dies and the other side gets destroyed. Think there will be, like, a white light and then nothing? It won't hurt, will it? Oh, it'd suck if it hurt. Bon, there's something I want to tell you. Actually, there are Don't you dare give me a good-bye speech. This is not a good-bye. That's the first thing. I know one way or another that you will always be here. The second is thank you for giving your life up for me. Jer. And the third is-- Wait. Don't tell me. If you don't tell me, we'll have to wait until another time, which means there will be another time. I'm not sure it works like that. Just go with it, ok? So what am I looking at here, hmm, blood clot, tumor, what? I did a full workup on your blood, Katherine. It's clean. My hair is going gray, and my teeth are falling out. I'm not sure what that suggests, but it's definitely not health. Patient is irritable. Not sure if this is a symptom or personality. Personality. Now tell me exactly what the hell is going on with me. You're aging. What? You said you were turned into a vampire give or take, and now that you're human, let's just say time is catching up with you. Ok. Ok. Well, how do we stop it? We don't. It's just life running its course quicker than normal. How much quicker? If it continues at this rate, you have a few months. I'm sorry. Hello, Damon. Well, look who decided to pick up his phone. Is your secretary out sick? They prefer administrative assistants now, thank you very much. I learned that on the bus. Very nice people on here by the way. You're taking a bus? Not to sound like a dick, man, but we're in a little bit of a rush over here. Yeah, but you know what's great about the bus? Open road, Damon. There's all this time to think, watch everyday human beings in their normal environment. Did you know that gas is over $3.00 a gallon at the moment? That seems to really concern a lot of people. This is not a time to have an everyman crisis. We need you back here to resurrect Bonnie before your nutter butter soul mate offs herself an destroys the other side. Yeah. I been thinking about that. Amara needs to die. Pardon me? My poor Amara, all those years trapped in stone clearly left her unhinged, so look, if she doesn't want to spend another moment on this earth, then I'm more than happy to put her out of her misery and spend the rest of eternity in the afterlife with her, but listen, if you want to go ahead and kill her and save me the trouble, then please by all means. Not till you bring Bonnie back, remember? Promises made metaphorical hands shook. I've been thinking about that, too, Damon. Remember when I told you that the universe is working to draw our doppelgangers together and you laughed in my face? Well, if you don't bring Bonnie back from the other side, then you'll be breaking your promise to Elena, and idea of jeopardizing your relationship brings me this perverse amount of joy, so I've decided not to help you, Damon, and I will see you soon. I'm looking forward to all this being over. Bye. Gah! Hey, Jesse. You missed our study session again. Where are you? Look. I'm really worried. Just call me. Well that was pathetic. Um, I'm sorry? Leaving a message for a boy who-- what's the American phrase-- oh--is just not that into you? And who are you? I'm looking for Katherine Pierce. I heard she was living here, so I checked your room. What? You went into my room? Do you know where she is or not? Great. Even Katherine's friends are bitches. I'm not her friend. Are you kidding me? I need to speak with you. Um, how do you two know each other? Katherine is my-- She's my stylist. Ahem. She cuts my hair. Ok. Whatever. So What do you want? Sit. You've been avoiding me. Yeah. I've been a busy girl doing busy things. Sit. We need to buy some more time, protect Amara. Maybe we should move her somewhere else. Silas is a witch. He's a living, breathing GPS tracking device. He'll track her wherever we take her. We can't let him anywhere near her until he brings Bonnie back. Weren't you listening to anything? He's not gonna bring her back. So, what, I should just give up? Come on, Stefan. You got your memory back. You know me probably better than anyone else. Do you really think that I'm gonna give up? You know what? You're right. I do know you. You put your hope in all the wrong places. And sometimes in the wrong people. Silas needs to die and put us all out of our misery. So long as he's alive, I'm holding out hope that he can still help us. Well, as someone who just spent the last 3 months at the bottom of a quarry because of the guy, I wouldn't hold your breath, pun intended. Silas needs to die, and I need to be the one to kill him, end of story. How's our mental patient doing? I guess all those years alone sent her over the edge. Relax. I'm--I'm just bringing dinner. I know you. I don't think so. You're the hunter. I never forget a face, but Silas killed you. You're dead. I was. I came back. How? I said how? It was you, wasn't it? You're a witch. You brought him back. You can see me? Of course I can see you. I'm not blind. I have eyes. Or are you dead? I get so mixed up. I can't tell the difference between the living or the dead. Can you see people on the other side? I am the anchor to the other side. I can see everything. Gah! Don't touch me! Please don't-- don't touch me. I can touch her. Ok. That's weird. Amara could see Bonnie, and Bonnie could touch her. They made physical contact. It's like Amara's got foot on each side or something. Amara exists in both places at once, here and the other side? Then she's not crazy crazy, she's just talking to dead supernatural beings roaming around in our basement. That's not the point. The point is is if Silas isn't gonna help us what if Bonnie could be the same thing? What if she existed on both sides at once? What if she became the anchor? You're right. Jeremy, you're right. So all we would need is someone who could do that spell. Oh, please don't say who I think you're gonna say. Think about it. Silas wants Amara to die, and Amara wants Amara to die, so who besides us is the one person with the biggest stake against letting that happen? I was hoping we could talk. And I was hoping you were my Chinese food. Good-bye. You remember Amara, right, brunette, brown eyes, I'm surprisingly not in love with her? What about her? Well, she took the cure, she wants to die, and we have her. But she's alive? For now. Silas is literally on his way to kill her. He's completely obsessed with destroying the other side so that he and Amara can live happily ever after in the great beyond. Man, you were right about these doppelgangers. They do always end up together. So how does it feel to say, "I told you so"? Like I want to shoot fireballs at Silas and drown him in acid. See? That's what I thought. So how would you feel about us making a deal? Haven't you heard it's bad luck to kill your doppelganger? Yeah? Well, if I don't kill him, he wins. And what if he kills you first? Witches aren't exactly easy to take down. We just got you back, Stefan. Don't do anything crazy. You and I have been down the revenge road, and it's not worth it. You know, there were these moments in that safe, a stillness in time when I was dead right before I was about to come back to life, I would think about things in the past that made me happy, things that gave me hope. All these things kept me sane. They pushed me to hang on when all I wanted to do was give up and turn off my humanity, but eventually, the pain took those moments away from me, too. I'm so sorry. Every time I close my eyes, I can see Silas stabbing me, I can feel myself drowning, and I need to make it stop. If I don't kill him, I'm gonna lose my mind, or I'm gonna turn off my humanity or both. So here's my pitch. In order to keep the other side in place, you need something to anchor the spell, right, something powerful, like an immortal being powerful. Now Amara was obviously a great choice until she downed the cure, so would you consider someone who's dead but stuck on the other side a viable candidate? An anchor swap? Because I've got a volunteer. I'd be making a ghost a human toll booth between our side and the other side, giving her the power to interact with our physical world and the supernatural Purgatory. So what's the problem? I need a massive amount of power to do a transfer spell like that. Fine. Name your poison. I need something to draw on. The moon's not full, I don't think there's a worthy comet for another couple billion years. Think hard. I have a girlfriend at home who misses her best friend and a wacky stowaway on suicide watch. It's ridiculous. Doppelgangers. They're powerful, mystical, naturally recurring. You want doppelganger blood? I got doppelgangers coming out of my ears. How many do you want? You hate junk food. You call it toxic poison. Yeah? Well, I've decided to live a little. Now may I be excused, scary vampire daughter? You've been avoiding me. I don't like it. Clearly. We had a moment, you and I. There was a bond. I felt it, and then nothing. You abandoned me all over again. Ok. First of all, I never abandoned you. You were snatched out of my arms at birth because my father thought I was a knocked-up, shameful slut, and second of all, it's been 500 years. Do we really have to do this whole mother-daughter bonding thing? Estrangement is so much easier, don't think? Sorry to interrupt the world's weirdest lunch, but, you with the doppelganger blood, duty calls. Wonderful. Now that Katherine's a human and fragile, everyone thinks that they can just boss her around. Hands off, ok? I'm going. We're not done. Oh, yes, we are. So you live in this giant mansion with two doppelgangers that are destined to end up together? I swear there's a sitcom in there somewhere. So where's the ancient boyfriend-stealing bitch? This way. That'll be all. Well, if it isn't the face that launched a thousand doppelgangers. A little birdie told me you aren't enjoying your immortal life. to say to me? No apology? I'm sorry. What was that? I'm sorry. Oh. That is what you want to hear, isn't it, how I have suffered, how every moment of my life has been a living a hell? It has! My sin was falling in love, and I've learned my lesson. You win. You win. Now please kill me. Please. Please kill me! Don't worry. When I make someone else the anchor, I will, and since you're nothing more than a non-supernatural human, you'll pass on while Silas is trapped on the other side, and then you and Silas, you're gonna spend eternity apart And that is gonna be kind of fantastic for me. Selfishly speaking. The cute one's here. She's all yours. Let me guess. You must be Who now? Let's be clear. I don't care about Bonnie Bennett or the other side going away or Elena getting her best friend back. You want something? I'm shocked. I had the cure you created running through my veins, and when Silas sucked it out of me, I started aging faster than normal. So basically, I'm dying, and I need you to fix me. You made the cure. Now make something that stops the aging. Otherwise, no blood for you. Fine. When the ritual's finished and Bonnie is the anchor, we'll find a way to stop you from dying. Thank you. Now where's tweedledee and tweedledum? What is that? It's Bonnie's grimoire. A grim--what? It's a magic spell book. Idiot. It's a talisman. Since Bonnie can't be here, here grimoire will have to do. Hands in, palms up. Sorry, love. Did that hurt? I've been through worse. Easy, ok? I'm fragile these days. Unh! Showoff. Inah ahpran koh sahtee ha jem. Ay pahta kay rasa tahn. Inah ahpran koh sahtee ha jem. Ay pahta kay rasa tahn. Inah ahpran koh sahtee ha jem. Ay pahta kay rasa tahn. No. Is it done? No, it's not done. What's happening? Silas is happening. Show yourself, bastard! I can't see anything. Can you? Electricity's out in the whole house. What happened? Silas is here. Well, Silas owes me a fuse box. Hang on. I only count two doppelgangers. Where's crazy pants? And where's the other crazy? That was quite the show, Silas. Thank you. You haven't seen the love of my life running around here by any chance, have you? Nope. Maybe you shouldn't have turned the lights off, genius. You've had 2,000 years to watch us suffer. You've had your fun. Why can't you just let it go? Maybe I'm just not wired that way. Honestly, I feel sorry for you. Hateful vengeance is for people without real love. Unh! Ugh! You spent 2,000 years waiting for me to die just so you could be with me when all along the universe knew I belonged to somebody else. Doesn't that make your whole existence, like, I don't know, a total waste? I loved you. Yeah? Well, get in line. Sucky timing, Stefan. I disagree. I have Amara just beyond the property line. You have 10 minutes to come find us. Well, I'm a little busy right now watching my nemesis bite it. Plus I have no interest in saving Amara's life. I know that, which is why I'm gonna take her away, and I'm gonna keep her alive by any means possible while everyone else hunts you down like an animal. You now have 9 minutes. Katherine? What are you doing? Tessa's stupid nonsurgical incision won't stop bleeding. Here. Heal. What's wrong? Nothing. Just another tragic side effect from taking that cure. Apparently the universe just doesn't want me to heal from vampire blood. Stupid universe. Find me that damn witch so she can finish that spell! No way. Can't a witch rest in peace? It's a flesh wound. Get up. Unh! You're not done yet. Ohh! Amara. I loved you. I still do But I can't live any longer. Please understand. I understand. I love you. Silas, please. I'm ready. Do you remember me? I remember you. Oh, I'm sorry. Is it hard to breathe? Is your throat closing? Did the fear of dying start to creep in yet? I hear every emotion is heightened for a vampire. All those memories must be eating you alive right now, Stefan. At's it like to die? I've never done it. You must have done it, what, a thousand times over the summer? Stop it. Stop? I spent in a tomb. You were locked up for, what, 3 months? Look at you. You're a mess. The safe was the easy part, wasn't it? Being forgotten about, that's the real torture, isn't it? Unh! Silas! Aah! Aah! Aah! Stefan and Amara are not inside. That's because Stefan took her. You have to go find him before he gets himself killed. No. He's luring Silas away so he can finish this. It's typical Stefan. He'll be fine. He's hurting. Damon, he's not thinking clearly. Ok. Silas may have been the one that put him in that safe, but we were supposed to get him out of it. Please go find him. We can't lose him again. Ok. Inah ahpran koh sahtee ha jem. Ay pahta kay rasa tahn. Our journey starts now. Unh! No! Amara. No. Amara, Amara. Drink this. Drink. More. No, no, no. Ok. No. Hey. Stay with me. Look at me, look at me. Amara, Amara. Hey! Look at me. I've been in hell for 2,000 years. What's another Hey! Let me die. No! Amara! Come on. Please. Ay pahta kay rasa tahn. I came to say good-bye. What are you talking about? Tessa's doing the spell. Amara's dying, Jer. No. That's impossible. Damon-- Stop. We don't have much time. Ay pahta kay rasa tahn. Ay pahta kay rasa tahn. Amara, Amara! Please, Amara! Tell me the third thing. Bon. Tell me, please. Ay pahta kay rasa tahn. I love you. I love you, too. I'm not ready to let you go. I can feel you! I can feel you. Bonnie? Please tell me this is real. You guys can see me? Bonnie, it worked. It worked! Oh! You're here! Thank you. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! And we can be roommates because we have an extra bed, and we can clear out half the closet! Caroline. I can't believe you're really here! I'm here. I'm back. I miss this. I miss feeling warm. I never felt warm on the other side. I miss this Holding your hand. I'm never gonna let you go again. Ok. I'm ready. Let's do this. You. Right. You want me to stop the aging? I'd find a drug store cream. Hilarious, but see the thing is, I'm not getting any younger, so spell away. Altering someone's lifespan is what started this whole mess in the first place. I've learned my lesson. I'm not saving your life. Excuse me? I won. Amara's gone, and Silas is waiting for me on the other side. No. No! Help. Help! Somebody, help her! She's dying! Don't die. I need you. True love prevails The universe be damned. No! You're the anchor now. Tessa. Where did you just come from? I'm dead. As I pass through you, you'll feel my death. You'll feel every death. Every supernatural being that passes over to the other side will pass through you. Sorry. That's gonna hurt like a bit bitch. So he's dead? It's over? Yeah, it's over. Are you ok? I'm fine. Look at me and tell me that killing Silas worked, that you'll be ok now. Why is this so important to you? Because I know how much he stole from you. Yeah, and he's dead. And because while you were suffering in that safe, grasping onto hope, fighting every second so that you wouldn't lose your humanity, I was happy. I got everything that I wanted, Stefan. I got to be in love, I got the summer of my dreams, I got Bonnie back. So I need to know that this worked. I need to know that it's gonna take away all of your suffering. I need to know that you're gonna be ok. I wanted it to be you. When that safe finally opened and somebody found me, I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be both of you. Hey. Umnow that Bonnie's back Your room's full. Got it. I'll just get my stuff. Thank you for what you did today. Enough. I killed you once, don't forget. We still hate each other, ok? Yes, you did, and, yes, we do. Where the hell is my bag? Already packed. You again. I'm leaving, Katherine. I'm heading back to Prague, and I'd really like it if you came with me. We can go to Bulgaria, retrace our lives. I don't know what kind of twisted fantasy you have about us, but that's all it is, a fantasy. I would rather rip my own heart out than do more mother-daughter bonding with you, and I'm human now, so it wouldn't really be that easy. I don't want to know you. Mother-daughter? She's your-- Oh. Wow. I'm doing you a favor, Nadia, ok? I can't be there for you, so take a good look because you are never gonna see me again. Hello, my shadow self. Look at me and tell me that you'll be ok now. Aah! He's dead? It's over? It's over? No. No. It's over. It's supposed to be over.
