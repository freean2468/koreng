The Devil Inside



                    			Previously on "The Vampire Diaries" Damon, don't leave me! In order for me to save my self, I had to shut off my humanity, damn it. No regret. We're even, Enzo. Do you know the reason we're together? Because Klaus granted us permission to be together. If you promise to walk away and never come back, then, yes, I will be honest with you about what I want. I will walk away, and I will never come back. A vampire killed my parents. Maybe that was you. That was all me. I'm bad, Elena. I am bad for you, and I'm choosing to let you go. When I get Elena back, just remember you're the one pep-talked me out of doing the right thing for all mankind. You are a traveler. You have the ability to keep living inside someone else's body. We just have find one who can teach you how to do the passenger spell. Jaryakat a zem. Daryeet acza. Talk to me. Did it work? Of course it worked. I'm Katherine Pierce. I survive. Guess who! Hmm. I wonder. Elena Gilbert? Yep! Hee hee! You're in a good mood. Well, it's a good day. We're alive. Yes, we are, and we are partying tonight. Yes, we are. So what did you want to talk to me about? Are you still drinking vervain? No. I wear this bracelet in case anyone needs my blood, remember? This is gonna hurt me more than it hurts you. Aah! Phew! What are you doing? I need that. Long story short I'm Katherine, not Elena. - Katherine's dead. - Not exactly. While you guys were all playing drinking games, toasting to what a horrible person I am, I was plotting a way to passenger myself into Elena's cute, little head. Oh, my God. Anyway, I need a crash course on all things Elena Gilbert. She's in college now, all grown up, and I figured who knows her better than her compellable best friend? So what do you think? How's my dress? It screams safe and predictable. Am I right, or am I right? I'm not doing this. Just compel him already. Take the fun right out of it, why don't you? Play along with my secret, Matty Pants. Would Elena wear this outfit to a party? No to the dress, yes to the shoes. Now let's talk honestly about the red thing that's happening in my hair. So you're dead and, what, hitching a ride in her brain? For now until I make it permanent. Permanent? How? Hello! The hair. Why did she dye it? I don't know. She did it in New York right after she shut her humanity off. But her humanity's back now. Perfect. It's gone. Ok. What's Jeremy's birthday? October 13. When's Elena's birthday? June 22. What's my address? but you burnt your house down. I know. That was a trick question. Good job! Who do I like better Bonnie or Caroline? Please say Caroline. You love them both equally. Well, that's a shocker. Ok. I just have one last question. It's very important because I'm going to need it later. How exactly did Elena Gilbert break up with you? Mia said she needs your corpse. My corpse? Could travelers be any creepier? Be nice. Without Mia, you wouldn't be alive or inside Elena's body right now. I know. I'd be dead in my corpse, a corpse that some traveler says that they need. You see how that's creepy? Do you want to be in control of Elena's body or not? Look. I get it, ok? We have no idea when Elena's consciousness is gonna pop out. Now you want to tell me what you're doing over there? Get on the bed. Just in case Elena decides to show up while I'm out getting your body. So I'm just gonna be stuck in a hotel room, bound to a bed while Damon Salvatore's leaving me voicemails? Remind me again how this is better than being dead. Because once Mia does her spell, Elena will be gone forever, and this body will be yours for good. Where you been? Just out. Define out. One who hovers and sticks his nose in other people's business. Oh. I'm sorry. I was defining annoying. That's funny. Katherine's rotting corpse was stinking up the house. I got rid of it. Could be a bit of a problem. Oh? And why is that? Because I'm here for Katherine's body. You're out of luck. You ain't getting it. My mother asked to be buried with her family in Bulgaria. And nothing gives me greater joy than to deny her dying wish. Damon, who cares? Katherine's dead. Just give her the damn body. Bitch ruined our lives. Nadia's known her, what, Tell me where she is. The nicest thing that Katherine Pierce will ever do is feeding the maggots that feast on her flesh. Give it up. You're not getting her back. Have you seen my phone? Ty! Have you seen my phone? I'm late for work, dude. Look at you, captain responsible. Here. Join me for breakfast. No. You know, I'm good, seeing it's, uh, 7:42. Aye, aye, Captain. Ok. So you gonna tell me what happened in New Orleans? Well, there were witches, gumbo, a few originals. Look. It doesn't matter because it's over, in the past. No more drama. I'm starting fresh. Ok, then. We're celebrating. I'm throwing you a welcome back party. Wait. What? No. Yeah. So clean this place up and invite some people and, uh, shower because you stink. It's open! Hey. Are you cleaning the fireplace? Yeah. Well, you know, all those carcinogens. Heh. I'm stress cleaning. I'm stressed, so I'm cleaning. Boy drama. Not that you care. I'm here for Elena, but clearly she's not here. I'll I'll come back later. Well, I can give her a message. Uh, yeah, can you just tell her that Wes isn't gonna be a problem anymore? I mean, my family's trust came through, and I was able to cut off Augustine's funding. So no more vampire experiments? Yeah, that's over. And can you just tell her that I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for everything? I will. Ok. Aaron Whitmore. Just the man I've been looking for. Enzo. Hey. I need a favor. You know how Damon as trying to be all noble and broke up with Elena? Of course. There was champagne. Yeah. Well, I kind of convinced him he was an idiot. You what?! And now he's in a bit of a mood, and something tells me that he's been trying to get ahold of Elena, but she hasn't been returning his phone calls. Look. I would love to help if I thought he was actually good for her, but I don't. Caroline, how would you liked to be judged solely based on who you're attracted to? Come on. Why? Do you know something? Why? Should I know something. I just mean are you sure that this is what you really want, you know, Elena and Damon or Damon and Elena, or I know that there's a nickname in there somewhere. Listen. I actually think that Elena is good for Damon. She makes him happy, and we all know that when Damon is happy He's not out there killing people, which I guess is a plus for mankind. Exactly. But even if I wanted to help, she's not here. I thought that she was with you. She was told me she was staying at Whitmore. Ok. That's weird. Well, where the hell is she? Does that thing ever shut up? Where am I? What's going on? Oh, my God. Katherine. Hello, Elena. You! You put Katherine inside of me instead of you. What happened? Elena Gilbert happened. Wonderful. She's fighting. It's only a matter of time before she comes out again. Did you get my body? Oh, come on. Katherine is exactly where she's always belonged. I'm not giving the body back. Quit giving me that damn pouty face. I'm not giving you the pouty face. This is my "you're being a dick" face. Elena hasn't called you back. It's making you completely miserable. Yeah. I'm completely miserable. It's your fault, telling me to get her back. No. You're miserable because you did what you always do. You had a problem, and instead of dealing with it, you cut ties and you ran. You're enjoying this a little too much. Ok. So Bonnie took Jeremy to go visit her mom, and neither of them have talked to Elena. Who invited you? Scram. I invited her. Caroline agreed to help you get Elena back. You? You hate me. You once told me that calling me Satan was an insult to Satan. Well nobody's perfect. Mm-hmm. This is what it's come to? You brought me love advice from Prudy Trudy. I can be unpredictable and incredibly reckless. What's going on here? Are you guys baby-sitting me? We're just hanging out, chatting. I don't need this, and I don't need your help. Well, I guess you better try Elena again. Ugh. Seriously, I have never met a group of needier people. It's not bad enough that Damon's trying to win me back. I'm also getting "where are you?" "I'm worried about you." "Call me." "Are you going to Tyler's party?" It's a wonder that this thing still has a battery. They're getting suspicious. Yeah. We need to find your body. Stefan texted and asked if I was going to Tyler's party. Maybe I do go, convince everyone that Elena is alive and well, and I casually ask him where Damon buried me. No. No way. You said it yourself. It's just a matter of time until Elena shows up again. So then come with me. Shove her back in if that happens. This is not the right place for your to be, around all her friends. I've impersonated Elena a million times. I can mimic everything about her. This is different. You're not impersonating Elena. You are Elena. When is her birthday? What grade did her and Caroline meet? Where did she kiss Stefan for the first time? Ok, ok. I get your point. I'm gonna have to brush up on a few fun facts, and I know exactly who can help us. You know, you still own my house. Yeah, legally. It's not like I pay the bills. Yeah, but it means you'll have to invite certain people in tonight, people like Elena, Stefan. That your lame way of asking if invited Caroline? Pretty much. Yeah, she's coming. So when you say you're starting over, you're basically saying you want Caroline back. Just get the cups, ok? God. Elena, hey. Hi, Matty! Matty? Matt. I mean, Matt, I was, um, hoping that you could help me with something. Guess who! Hmm. I wonder. Enzo. Hello, Damon. Ahh. We have a bit of business to attend to. Missed a spot. Ooh! Oh. I love a good fire. Oh! That's ironic, isn't it, you know, since you left me to burn alive in one? Didn't we already do this? You tried to make me feel guilty, I saved your life, we're even. - What's in the bag? - More like who. Ah. Since you and I last spoke, I've done a bit of soul-searching, had a trip to the barber, and did a little research, which revealed to me that you killed almost every member of the Whitmore family in the years since your escape, leaving just one alive each time to carry on the family name, producing a whole new generation of victims for you to slaughter exactly as you said you'd do back when you and I were cellmates. Well, you know me. I like to keep my promises. And it's occurred to me that perhaps I wrote you off too quickly, that, in fact, the Damon Salvatore I remember is alive and well, and I have a present for him. You brought me Aaron Whitmore Alive. He's the last of the Whitmore clan. You remember this vervain wristwatch? Dr. Whitmore never took it off, even when he was rooting around in our chest cavities. Fitting Aaron should die wearing it, too. So do you want to kill him, or shall I? Ergh. You've got to be kidding me. Heh. Matt! Heh! Elena, hey. Come in. Thank you. Well, that wasn't awkward at all. Right. Sorry about that. It's ok. Go find some blond to hit on. All right. I'm gonna go make the rounds. You need anything? I'm good, thanks. Hey. Elena, you're alive. Of course I'm alive. Wow! Stefan Salvatore is drinking beer out of a cup. Do you want me to show you where Tyler keeps the bourbon? No. I'm trying to stay off the hard stuff. Hey. So Where have you been? Caroline was about to send out a search party for you. Around, thinking, processing, trying to figure out how to deal with this whole Damon thing. Hmm. You know he made a mistake, right? - He wants you back. - Yeah, I know. Hang on. Isn't this a little weird for you? It's incredibly weird, but, uh, I know my brother, and I know he's a better person with you than without you. So how are you? How are you dealing with the whole Katherine dying thing? I'm ok. Stefan, you don't have to hide your feelings. No. Honestly, I'm ok. You know, we had a thing, it ended, and she died, and I'm fine. You knew her for, like, 150 years. You're not even a little heartbroken? I mean, even I feel a little bad. You know, maybe we should give her, like, a funeral or something. A funeral? Where's she buried? I should at least drop off flowers or something. I have no idea. Damon said he put her where she was always meant to be. Classic Damon. As much as I've enjoyed your quality bourbon, I feel confident our next drink will taste better with the sound of young Aaron's dying screams ringing in our ears and the knowledge that your final act of revenge will have brought us both closure and a new beginning. I'm just curious. Do you ask all of your friends to prove their loyalty by killing someone over drinks? His grandfather slit our eyes open with a scalpel. You've taken out everyone else in the Whitmore family. I thought you'd want this. Would you believe he's a friend of a friend? No, because that would force me to believe that you've gone soft when you and I both know that your very first impulse when I presented him to you was to rip out his throat. Surely my old friend's still in there someplace. End this for both of us. Really bad timing, blondie. I'm dealing with a blast from the past. Then deal with it quickly and get your ass over to Tyler's. Elena's here. Looks like he's coming round. It's time to make a decision, Damon. Do you want to kill him, or shall I? I hate deadlines. Well, I didn't see that one coming. I can't kill you. Long story. Because Elena would hate you for it. That's why you can't kill me. Go back to college and pack up your entire life. There's one highway that heads out of town. Take it north till you hit ice. Don't ever come back. How domestic of you. Apparently Elena would do this sort of stuff. I'm actually starting to feel sorry for her. Did you find out where your body is or not? Stefan said Damon put me somewhere I was always meant to be. A riddle. For 145 years, Damon thought I was in a tomb underneath the old church, and, boy, was he disappointed when I wasn't there. Well, let's hope you are this time. Right. Now say your good-byes. We can't have anyone following us. There you are! I've been calling and texting. Sorry. My phone died. Um, what did you want to talk about? I did a bad thing. I'm sure it wasn't that bad. You don't even know what it is. Elena, stop. This is really important. Ok. I'm sorry. Tell me. What happened? What would you say if I told you that when a certain awful person was in town I ran into him in the woods and sort of kissed him? He was there, and he obviously wanted to kiss me, so I thought, "oh! We'll just make out," but then it felt really good to kiss him, so then I kind of totally had sex with him, but I swear I didn't plan to do it, and now I feel terrible. And the person we're talking about is Klaus. Oh, wow! That that Wow! Really? Would I make something like this up? And that is why I need you to tell me what an awful person I am. Actually, you're one of the least awful people I know. So tell me. How was it, you know, compared to Tyler? Elena Gilbert! Caroline Forbes! Come on. Spill the beans. I am Now that you've slept with Klaus, I mean, how was it? I am so not answering that. Oh, you so are. Oh, my God. Took you long enough. I was pretending to care. It was very time-consuming. Let's get it over with. In order to seal Katherine's spirit inside Elena's body, I'll need some of your blood. Then You mutilate my body. Lovely. Travelers don't have access to traditional magic, so we improvise. Now shut up. I have to concentrate. So, um, what's happening now? Katherine, if you want to say good-bye to Elena forever, I need silence. Are you ok? Save your daughterly concern. I'm fine. Get out. Just let me explain. No. Let me. Klaus killed thousands of people Elena's aunt, an entire pack of hybrids, my friends. Caroline He killed my mom! I know, I know. I am so sorry. Just stop. I walked out last time. Now it's your turn. Go. No. Don't take another step, Caroline. If you would just I said leave! You're drunk. Get your hands off me. What's the matter with you? Oh, you don't know? She screwed Klaus. Exactly. You know, drunk or not, she doesn't deserve that. You never told me where you wanted to go. Where I wanted to go? Once we complete the spell. Where should we start our world tour? Let me finish. Just a few more seconds, and then I'm done. Ohh! Elena. Come for What was that? I couldn't quite hear you. Donovan, you in here? Mia. Mia. Are you ok? Just finish the spell. What? No. No, no, no. You've got to be kidding me. Unh! No, no, no. Katerina, may I introduce to you the lord Niklaus. Call me Klaus. Come on. Kiss me, Damon, or kill me. Katherine, get out of my head! I will love you forever. Or at least a very long time. I fooled one of you. No! No! Unh! Aah! Aah! Unh! Damon! Damon, thank God. What's wrong? It's done. You're ok. Elena? Hey. Say something, please. I've been looking everywhere for you. We need to talk. Yeah, I want to talk, too. The message thingies on your phone, that's all me in case you deleted them and didn't listen to them. I listened to every word. Then you know how bad I screwed up. I wussed out, Elena. I bailed because I was convinced I'd ruin you. That's not what this is about, Damon. No. I know. Just hear me out, just hear me out. You are literally the best person I've ever known, and for me to think that I could change you gives me way too much credit and you not nearly enough. You are the best influence on me. I need you. You are the good, and I need a little good in my life Because without it, there's an awful lot of darkness. That's a lot of pressure, Damon. I know, Elena. No. No. It's my turn now. Yeah. I love that I make you a better person, I love that I make you happy, but I don't want to be the only thing that you live for. I don't want to worry about what's gonna happen every time we get into a fight or if we break up again or who you're gonna take it out on. What what are you talking about? I know what you did to Katherine, Damon. She was weak and dying, and you still tortured her. How is this about Katherine? It's not, ok? It's about you. It's about you, about the person that I can't change and the person that you really are. That person was right to let me go. I'm sorry, Damon, but it's over. We're over. Damon. Come on. Deep down, you got to be enjoying this a little bit. Hey. You know what I realized tonight? This is a big-ass house. I live in a fricking mansion. My parents are dead, the girl I love slept with my Nemesis, and I have absolutely no idea what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life, which get this lasts forever But I got a big-ass house. Why don't we get out of it for a while, you know, just go somewhere, be anywhere but here? Klaus put me through hell in New Orleans, Matt. He crushed me, and just when I thought it was over, that he couldn't destroy anything else or do anything worse Ohh. So that's it? It worked? Try not to sound so impressed, but, yes, Katherine Pierce has permanent control of Elena Gilbert's body. Now about that payment we discussed. Ugh. Was that necessary? No, but she was a loose end, and I hate that. Hmm. She gave me the creeps anyway. Cold, manipulative, good hair. You really are my daughter. If that's your way of thanking me, save it for the road. I'm not going anywhere. For the first time in the last There's no one coming after me. Hell, half the people in this town would probably slit their own throats to protect Elena Gilbert. And what about me? You're a grown woman. You can make your own decisions, but if you want my vote Stay. Now I'm not saying that I'll ever learn how to be a good mother, but I'll try. I've got all the time in the world to get it right. I've searched for you for centuries. I'm not leaving now, but we both know you want more than just mother-daughter bonding time. You're right. I want it all. I want my daughter, I want immortality, and I want Stefan Salvatore. He's my one true love. Well I'd hate to be the person standing in your way. Hey. There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Yeah. Well, I couldn't find a rock big enough to crawl under, so You're my friend. I need you to just give it to me straight. Am I a horrible person? Hmm. So that's why you came here, huh? All right. Let me ask you something. When you found out about me and Katherine, what was your first thought? Honestly, I thought, "eww." See? And if you held that against me, you wouldn't be sitting here right now with me, would you? Or maybe I came here because I know that you see the best in people. Ah. All right. Somebody has to say it, so here goes. You ready? Mm-hmm. Caroline Mm-hmm. You are a horrible person, ok? You are you are thoughtless, you're shallow, you're completely undependable Ha ha ha! Hey! Hey. I am I am vulnerable. Don't be mean. You know what? Now that I think about it, I have no idea what Klaus saw in you. What was he thinking? Ha ha ha! Shut up! Heh heh heh. Heh. Hey. You all right? You all right, man? Never better. We've been waiting for you. Damon's teaching me a little game. See, he assured me you'd be on this road heading out of town. You said that you were gonna let me go. I did. I tried. Does Elena know that you're here? She's the reason I'm here. No. Scratch that. I'm the reason I'm here. What do you want, Damon? I want the same thing you want, Aaron Go back in time, fix the past, get someone back I've lost. Everyone that I lost is because of you. You know who murdered my entire family? You! Justifiably. Either way, I did it. I tore them apart, I liked the sounds they made because I realized they deserved it like you. Elena was too good for you. I used to think that. Yeah. That I had to be better to deserve her love and she had to be worse to accept mine. I'd lie in the middle of the road, looking up at the stars, having conversations with people like you, trying to convince myself that killing them was a bad instinct and that sparing their lives was the right thing to do. So what'd you do? Did you kill them? It doesn't matter. The point is I was conflicted. Right now in this very, very moment, I am crystal clear. See, Elena thinks I'm a monster. You know what? She's right. Aah! Now that's the Damon Salvatore I remember.
