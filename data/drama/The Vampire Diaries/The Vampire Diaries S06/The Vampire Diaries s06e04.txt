                    			 Previously on "The Vampire Diaries" Damon's gone. I want you to compel me to forget that I ever loved him. - Who is Damon Salvatore? - He was a monster. That's my girlfriend Ivy. Somebody killed her last night right in front of me. Killing Enzo won't bring her back. If I kill him, I can leave this place, and I can start over again. I have my own way I like them to die. Vampires can't get into Mystic Falls. They can lurk around the borders. Sarah The girl you attacked and you compelled No! She knows what I am. My mom lived in Mystic Falls for years before she had me. - Where the hell are we? - 1994. My own hell. We're never getting out. There's someone else here. Incendia. We're on the same team. Do you always try and kill your teammates? The important thing is that you have your magic back because your magic is the key to getting the hell out of here. And of course, I broke into the oval office and took a picture of myself at the window looking all J.F.K., but then I was like, "wait. How am I gonna get these photos developed?" Oh, my God! Just answer the damn question. How are we gonna get out of this twilight zone? I got a question for you first. Why do you think we're stuck on a repeating loop of may 10, 1994, doomed to relive a solar eclipse forever and ever and ever? How the hell should I know? Well, I heard you tell Bonnie this place was your own personal hell. I'm kind of curious why. I found everything you asked for Can opener, shower drain, grinding wheel, jam, pocket knife, volume "O" of the encyclopedia, a nail, and a black marker. Now what? Can't show you with my hands taped. Bonnie. Thank you. Ok. Fine. How's this pile of crap gonna get us out of here? I'll explain as soon as you tell me what you did on may 10, 1994? What difference does it make? Put it this way. Bonnie's magic is one part of the equation. My as yet undisclosed knowledge is the other, which means you would be hitching a ride home for free. I just want to know if you deserve to come along. Or I could just torture you until you say something useful. If you torture me, I'll get mad, and then I won't want to help you. What kind of person needs to have that explained to them? Play nice. Stop trying to impress the new guy. Why don't you just tell him your story? Maybe because I don't want to talk about the worst thing I ever did, Bonnie. Ooh. Now I'm listening. Ready for some bad news? Unh. Heh. I barely seen you in 50 years, Stefan. You could invite a brother in. - Give me one good reason why. - Check your answering machine. I'm trying to turn over a new leaf. Oh, I heard your message. I also heard you sent Lexi some flowers to burn to death on a rooftop. Well That's a little late, but I see you're trying to make amends. I just want to know why. Ugh. Well, I can tell you this, Stefan. I'm tired of tearing up New York City. Maybe it's the partying, maybe it's my conscience. I believe that would require one. And then I had this moment of clarity, and I said, "wouldn't it be great if I just woke up in my own bed and could have a fresh start?" You must be Damon. Damon, this is, uh, Zach Salvatore. He owns the house now. He knows the family history, and I told him if you got out of line I'd take care of you myself. Why are you always expecting the worst out of me, Stefan? Oh, I don't. Otherwise, I wouldn't allow this. Come on in, Damon. Thanks. - You ready to start over? - Hell, yeah. Hey. Any sign of our runaway girl? Nope. Caroline and I combed the border of Mystic Falls 3 times already. No sign of Sarah. She's not any of the roads, which means she's probably in Mystic Falls. This is bad, Stefan. Her compulsion went away as soon as she crossed the border. She knows that Caroline and I are vampires. Listen. I got to go. I'll, uh, talk to you later. Where do you think you're going? Um, I'm going home. Savannah's not your home, Stefan. It's an escape, a hiding place. This is your home. No. This was my home, but I can no longer enter its borders. Therefore, I have a new home. So you're just gonna throw in the towel and go back to your fake new life? Look. My fake new life ended when Enzo decided to kill my not-so-fake girlfriend Ivy, so I am going to go home, pack up, and start over again. By pretending like your life here never existed. You'd be surprised how easy it is to forget the past, Elena. I'm not buying it. You lost your brother. There's no way that you're fine. You do not have to worry about me. It's not like I haven't done this before. - I have a system. - Show me. Prove to me that your system works. If I believe that you actually are happy, then I'll let you go, but if I don't buy it, which I probably won't, I will keep harassing you until you come home, and I'm talking about, like, Enzo-sized harassment. Deal? Sure. And what about our runaway girl Sarah? Well, we can't step foot in Mystic Falls, so now it's up to Matt and Jeremy. Attaboy. Get her all out. Is he seriously still wasted? Yeah. Little punk showed up on my doorstep last night at I thought you two were looking for Sarah together. I did my part. She is definitely not hiding in the Salvatore liquor cabinet. Listen. What about your vampire-hating neighborhood watch guy? If Sarah goes to him for help, that's a problem. I'm on my way to Tripp's office now. I think I can get him to trust me and tell me what he knows. Be safe. - Alaric. - Hi. Who do we have here? This is Jeremy Jeremy Gilbert. He is a little -Underage? -Yeah. Yeah. I can see that. I was hoping you could give him one of those rapid rehydration hangover cure type things. Oh, yeah. You mean, the ones we reserve for professional athletes and starving children in third-world countries. Yeah. I think we'll start with a full workup Physical, blood, toxicology. Yeah. Why don't you throw in an STD screening while you're at it, huh? -Really? -Yeah. Down the hall to the right. Do I want to know? It's just another day in the life of an occult studies Professor. Well, if that entails supervising drunk morons, then you and I have a lot more in common than I thought. Ah. I know, and I'm sorry Karen. Jay was a good kid. I promise. You'll be the first one to know. Ok. - Tripp, are you ok? - No. No. I just told Jay's parents that I was the one who found their son dead in the woods last night. I heard. - Do you know what happened? - You tell me. - He went to the party with you. - I don't know. He was drunk. I offered to give him a ride home, and he said he'd walk. I should have driven him home. Ok. I'm gonna give the sheriff my statement and try to make sense of what happened to Jay. Wait. Maybe I should go with you. I might have been the last person to see Jay alive. Ok. Done. Let's take a ride. I need to be entertained while I work.  Hell story, please  Remind me not to kill him. Maybe telling him your story will take your mind off of it. Whose side are you on? The side where get to go home to the people we love. Fine. In may 1994, I was living here. I'd come home to walk the straight and narrow. Can I have a sip of that? I'm starving. Sure. Whew. Mmm. It's good, right? Uh-uh. Oh, yeah. I can't remember if that squirrel was roadkill or one I caught in the rat trap. Better hope it was roadkill, though, because the rat trap was full of rat droppings. Swish your tongue around. Does it feel like hair, or is it more of a grainy pellet? Ugh. How's it going Zach? What's up with all the grocery trips? Ah. One of the boarders is craving blueberry pancakes. You know, maybe I should run the Salvatore boarding house. Hi. Take over for Zach, get in good with Gail. She's on vervain. So is Zach, which means hands off. Perfect. Our savior's insane and narcoleptic. No, no, no. I'm awake. Let me guess You killed the pregnant woman. Shut up, Kai. You weren't listening. I was listening in my sleep. You were hanging out with your distant nephew Zach, who you called uncle Zach because that's not confusing. Plus pregnant lady Gail, who had a big bull's-eye on her chest. Got it. Tell me you didn't kill a pregnant woman. Oh, that's totally what happened. Why else would today be his personal hell? Oh, here we go. The only reason that you're alive right now is because I thought you could get us out of here and you could help us, but you don't have any answers. You're just a man-child with jam on your fingers! Ok then. To get home, we'll harness the power of the eclipse using a mystical relic. It's called an ascendant, and it looks like this, Damon. The last time we had it was in the pacific northwest. Oregon. - We? - It belonged to my family. So here's a little blood to get you started. Now all we need is a locator spell to pinpoint its whereabouts. Think you can find our ticket out here, Bon Bon? Hell, yeah. - She's cute. - Was cute. I'm sorry. Me, too, but what's done is done. So after taxes and social security and health insurance, I'm left with $206.03 to spend for the week. - You want to get drunk? - Stefan, health insurance? Yeah. The point is to start over, pretend to be as human as possible. Oh, ok. So no vampire privileges, no baggage, nothing from our old lives whatsoever, huh? Ahem. What's this? You got me there. See, Damon isn't around to call it a granny mobile, so Yeah. Your brother really did love to torture people with nicknames and just plain torture people. That's one way to put it. So your system for moving on requires both burning bridges and a dead-end job. We haven't even gotten to the fun part. Paying utilities? No. Deciding who you want to be for the next 30 years. Do you want to be an astronaut, you want to be an olympic athlete, you want to skip med school, boom, you're a doctor. Go ahead. Challenge me. I'll show you how it's done. All right. Let's see what you got. Ok. Quite a boozer that kid. Put him on a saline drip. He's lucky I didn't pump his stomach. Yeah. You know, he's had a rough couple of months. Did you bring him in here to put a band-aid on it and make some more excuses? No. I actually came here for some advice from a professional. Well, a kick in the ass might help. Jeremy, too. Look. If he's anything like his sister, I'm sure he'll be fine. It's nothing I don't treat every single night on campus or didn't do myself when I was a student. Ok. What about you? Former party animal? Oh, yeah, yeah. I used to get kicked out of the library all the time, you know, because it was closing. Right. Head in the Wiccan bible? Ok. One more piece of professional advice. When a successful, sexy, only moderately insecure doctor is flirting with you, give her your undivided attention. Caroline's laying low at the dorm, no sign of Sarah yet, which means she's either hiding out or she's planning her nightly news exclusive to out me. Well, if she does out you, then you start your life over somewhere else free of all the, uh, supernatural drama. Right. So you ready to see the system in action? - Ready. - All right. - Hand over your ring. - What? Your ring. Ok. Elena Williams Ohh! Stefan Cooper, what are you doing? We've known each other for a very long time now, and you've always been my best friend. I have always loved you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. - Will you - Wait! You're not just proposing to me because I'm pregnant, are you? No. No. I-I am proposing to you because you are my rock, ok? You have stood by my side through the multiple rehabs, the jail time, the bull fighting injury. I mean, you have brought me back from the edge, and, sweetheart, this baby is the best thing that ever happened to us. Will you marry me? Yes! Ha! Oh! Aw. You're crazy. See that? New identities, new lives. It's easy. Thank you all so much. Thank you. Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinem. It doesn't feel right. Maybe I need a bigger map. Maybe you're just out of practice and you suck at magic now. Ignore him, Bonnie. Pretend he's a white noise machine. That's how I used to tune out my siblings. I grew up with a ton of little sisters and brothers and all of them constantly yammering, but it, uh, taught me how to focus. Easy there, big brother. She doesn't know you. At least buy her a drink. - Can I call you Liz? - Sure? Your daughter is so adorable. Yeah. Caroline's high maintenance, but she's worth it. I am so getting rid of that photo. Stefan, come take a picture of Zach and me. Sure. Thanks, Stefan. And now back to my cravings. Hey. Um, what happened to your wrist? I don't know. So how does thing help us watch the eclipse? You put it in between you and the thing that's too hot to look at. Ahh! It works! My husband would get a kick out of you. We should invite you over to dinner sometime. Damon, what'd you do to Gail? Is everything ok? Looks like the jig is up. Hey. Look at me. Go home. Forget you ever met us. Hey. How the hell did you feed on Gail? - She's on vervain. - In her coffee. I swapped it out last week, same for Zach. These people are my friends. Zach is family. They trust me. And they'll trust us both. Look. I'm only feeding inside the house, right? Snatch, eat, erase. It's all completely functional, Stefan. I told you it's a new start. Nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinem. Phesmatos tribum nas ex viras, sequitas sanguinem. The blood's moving towards Virginia. That can't be right. Uh-uh. The spell's working. It's showing me Mystic Falls. It feels so Close. It's right Here. Very good. That's the ascendant? The one and only. Thanks for the mind games, jackass. It was just another little test to make sure Bonnie's magic was precise enough for the spell. I do believe you're ready. Pack your bags. We're going home. Ohh. So here's what I don't get, Damon. Why'd you insinuate yourself back into my life and then cheat and lie and break all the rules? Well, I lied because I knew you'd be mad. Believe it or not, I like being here, Stefan. Aah! Auugh! You'll get your daylight ring back when you decide to behave. Now answer my question. - Why'd you come back here? - Because I missed my brother. I wanted to have a connection to my humanity, Stefan, I wanted to feel something again, and when I decided to come back home, it all came rushing back just like I hoped it would. Oh, congrats. Now what? Come on, man. Let's just hit the road, you and me. Huh? I'll let you drive my car, I'll get you off this vegan diet, teach you how to feed again. It'll be great, Stef. Huh? What do you say? Come on! Trust me. Yeah. I can imagine a road trip with you. Yeah. I can imagine you feeding on innocent people and leaving a trail of bodies behind. I can imagine you making me drink human blood and laughing at me while I suffer. Way to be an optimist, Stefan. I'm just looking at the facts, Damon. to drink human blood again, which is why I became a ripper. me off the rails again because you were so damn needy. my best friend to die after I sent her to come help you, and now I'm finally happy, I have a new life, I'm doing well, and, uh, you just can't handle that, can you, Damon? I'm not trying to screw up your dumb new life. You don't have to try, Damon. All you have to do is exist because no matter what I do or where I go, you will be with me forever, trying to destroy every single thing that I built. I don't know why I thought this time would be any different. I wanted it to be different, but you just keep failing. Guess that's a no on the road trip, huh? That's a no on the road trip. So according to Caroline, Sarah's still M.I.A., and now Enzo's missing. Probably out killing someone else's girlfriend. Uh, uh. Pregnant, remember? Dumbest lie I've ever told. Can I just take that one back? No, but you'll have to reinvent yourself in 30 years. If you don't, people will start asking why you're not getting any older. But when I first met you, you said you'd been away from Mystic Falls for 15 years. What made you come back ahead of schedule? You said it yourself. I met you. Since 1864, I have been a carpenter, an ambulance driver, a migrant worker, high-school student. So then why auto mechanic for 200 bucks a week? No reason. Yeah. It must be hard, all that change without a constant in your life. We haven't talked about your brother. A little weird to hear you refer to Damon as just my brother. What else would I call him? I don't even know anymore. Anymore? What does that mean? You know what? It's, uh, it's not important. Things change, right? To change. Who cares what people think, right? To change. You're wandering around like a crazy man why? I'm looking for the exact right spot. We need to find where the power of the eclipse is focused. You could've just shown us the ascendant to begin with. Yeah, but I wanted to feel your hand on my chest. There's something not right about him. You're just not used to guys hitting on you. You know, I can't wait to get out of here and talk to somebody else. Can we just have a few lasting seconds of peace while this idiot uses that thing to get the stars to align? Hey. What's up with the nature walk? I used the ascendant to figure out where we need to be standing during the eclipse. Great. Let's do some magic, get the hell out of here. -Oregon. -What? I've read this paper, like, a thousand times. There's something in it about Oregon. What about it? You know, Kai said he had all those brothers and sisters? Mm-hmm. "Family massacred in Portland"? The only one missing was the oldest boy, a 22-year-old named Malachai. Who names a kid Malachai? It's like they expected me to be evil. All these kids were murdered. Hello? Not everyone died. I had a soft spot for one of my sisters. Otherwise, I would have cut her lungs out and not just her spleen. What? You can survive without a spleen. Something tells me you're not speaking hypothetically. Well, these two, I, uh, hung off a stairwell railing. Then I put a hunting knife in her abdomen, and him I drowned in the pool. He kept fighting me. I was like, "I saved you for last, you ungrateful little" Anyway, that was that. You just killed your whole family? Coven to be precise. Oh, you know, a family of witches. You've been making her jump through hoops, and you're a witch? Sort of yeah. No powers obviously. Oh, and of course, Gemini coven did not take it too well when they heard what I did in Portland. That's why they banished me here. This place is a prison. They created it for you. Yep! This isn't your hell, Damon. It's mine. You call this a fair fight? You're basically an original vampire. You've killed an original before. Now get your head in the game, and maybe you'll keep it out of the bottle. Happy? I am trying to help you pull yourself together, Jeremy. - Now what is your problem? - My problem is that everyone thinks that I shouldn't have one. I have the right to be messed up right now. Bonnie is dead. She knew it was gonna happen, and she said good-bye over the phone just so you Keep going. So what? So I could come back to life, right? You, Elena, Stefan, Tyler, Enzo. She saved everybody but herself. Listen, Jeremy. You want to talk about resentment, huh? Is that it? My wife ran away because she would rather be a vampire than be married to me. Come to find out, it was Damon who turned her, and then she died, and then Jenna She died, and then I died, and then the guy who killed my wife died, and I actually kind of miss him, and now I can't even talk to a girl without fantasizing about tearing into her neck? I mean, Jeremy, I have resentment for years, years! I get it, ok, but I find a way to keep going because that's what we do. We find a way to keep going! Ok? Oh. Right. So if we were to run into each other in some random town in 30 years, do we pretend like we're strangers? Elena, I'm avoiding Mystic Falls, not you. We can talk, we can visit, and if you ever need a car repair, I will give you the parts at cost. - Bye, Stefan. - Bye. Hey, man. Ahh. Noticed you weren't celebrating my engagement. How come? Hard to be happy for the guy who put my brother in the hospital. Oh. Right, right, right. Ok. Hey. Remind me. Which guy was it Broken nose or fractured arm? I was kind of drunk. I'm still waiting for the congrats on my engagement. "I'm really happy for you." Yeah. Heh heh. That all you got? Come on, man. Hit me. Come on. Ohh. You frigging enjoying this? You sick freak! Go home, clean up, and forget this ever happened. What the hell are you doing? We're not letting Kai out of here, ok? He just said he's a serial killer. I don't care. I want to get out of here. How can you not care? Maybe because of all the horrible things you've done? Maybe because killing a bunch of kids is not a big deal to someone who's murdered a pregnant woman? Am I wrong? - Did you leave the door open? - No. Why? This eclipse party blows. I didn't see the sun at all when I made it across the yard. You forget how much stronger we are when we drink human blood. Zach. - Damon, please don't hurt her. - I want my ring back, Stefan. Attaboy. I'm never gonna be rid of you, am I? No. No, you're not because in 1912 I showed you who you were, Stefan. In 1942, I gave you your freedom, and in 1977, I almost killed your best friend because it should have been you there to help me, Stefan. You owe me, and it'll take you an eternity to pay me back. No! An eternity of misery, brother, just like I promised. Ouch. Poor nephew Uncle Zach. Stefan compelled Uncle Zach to forget about the girlfriend and the baby, but he couldn't cover up all those murders. The founders' council was restarted, and Stefan took off, left Mystic Falls for about 15 years. We both did, and then when I saw Uncle Zach again, I couldn't look at him without remembering that I had ruined everything, so it was a nice relief when I got to kill him. - Ok. Can we go back now? - Oh, come on, Bonnie. You want to go home to your friends, I want to go back and give the rest of the Gemini coven an excruciating death. Win-win. Look. I know this guy's not a model citizen, ok, Bonnie, but I got to get back, not just for Elena but for my brother. I'm sorry, Damon. Sorry doesn't work for me. Hey. We might be having a bit of a disagreement, but don't ever lay a hand on her. Kind of a nonissue now. Missed today's eclipse. - Rain check for tomorrow. - No. So you and the sheriff don't seem to get along. Oh. Liz and my wife were high-school rivals, some issue about who was captain of the field hockey team. - You're married? - I was. Yeah. Kris died in a car accident. I'm sorry. Well, that's why I left Mystic Falls. Too many memories. So what'd you tell the sheriff about Jay? Oh, just what I saw. Uh, tons of blood. Probably a mountain lion. Just another animal attack, huh? You sound doubtful. This is gonna sound weird, but last night, Jay told me that he was tracking a vampire. I mean, that's crazy, right? I'm gonna show you something. I thought you agreed to leave. I forgot my jacket, Stefan. What happened with that guy? I told you I have a system. Letting somebody kick your ass so that you can feel? You are the last person who should be lecturing me on coping mechanisms. You're not alone in your grief, Stefan. I lost Bonnie when you lost Damon, but I fought through it. Yeah? All by yourself? Yes. And it was hard. I know that you're pushing me away because I never liked Damon Believe me, that's not what it is. And I know that he's your brother. I get it, but why inflict so much pain on yourself for such a hateful person? I mean, he doesn't deserve your grief. There's got to be another way that you can move on. I'm sorry that I can't just forget him like you, Elena. - No one's forgetting him. - You are. You erased him. What are you talking about? You had Alaric compel you to forget every good thing that Damon ever did. You made him a monster in your own mind because you couldn't handle the grief of losing him. I don't believe anything that you're saying. Why would I do that? Because you were in love with him, and he was in love with you, and when Damon died, a part of you died, too. Wow. Oh, God. What? No, no. Stefan, how could I possibly love Damon? Believe me, I asked myself that for a very long time, and then eventually, I saw it. Damon inspired you, he pushed you to own the darkest parts of yourself, and when you died, he was the only one that could make you feel alive again, and you made him feel human. You love Damon for the same reasons that I love Damon because in spite of every single thing that he did we couldn't live without him, and now you don't have to, but I do, so I'm gonna do it my way. You can do it yours. - What is this place? - A secret. A secret I only share with people I trust. You remember the gas leak in town over the summer? Well, I came back to make sure my grandmother was ok. First time I've been back in years. When I crossed the town border Something changed. Memories came flooding back. And I realized that my wife didn't die in a car accident. She was murdered, drained of her blood right in front of me, and the killer made me believe I was responsible. I had to find out what kind of monster could do all that. Vampires They are real, and one murdered my wife, but this is the one who murdered Jay, and I'm gonna get him to name all his vampire buddies, starting with the one who bit your friend Sarah. Sarah? You try anything, and I call 911 and out your vampire sister to the world. Hey. Just take it easy. What do you want? Answers. I found this when I was tossing the house last night. That's my mom, and the reason I know this is because I've had this since I was a baby. My mom was a Jane Doe. Her body was still warm when they dumped it at the hospital The nurses thought I was DOA, too, but one doctor did an emergency c-section, and I survived. I lived 3 months in an incubator. They didn't know who my dad was, and neither did I, but then I found this. Your dad is Zach Salvatore. How could you obliterate an entire chapter of my life? Look, Elena. As much as I like to think that I am full of wisdom, I think it's time we stop pretending that I actually know what's best, ok? Look. I've got my own issues to sort out right now, and I think this will explain it much better than I can. "Dear me, if you're reading this, then somebody spilled the beans about your selective memory loss. My money's on Caroline. Yes, you loved Damon. You loved him with a passion that consumed you, and then when Damon died, the void he filled was too deep, too dark. Facing an eternity with your soul mate, you went off the deep end. You turned into someone that you weren't, a monster. Alaric can restore your lost memories. All you have to do is ask, but I hope that you don't. I tried it the other way. I didn't see an end to the pain. I want you to rediscover yourself in the absence of the one who defined you. If you feel any hope for the future at all, then you're already better off. You've been given a chance to start over. I want you to take it. I want you to be happy." So what do you want me to do? Can you hold on to that, keep it safe in case I ever need to read it again? Shame eating? Thinking about that pregnant lady. She had a thing for pancakes. - That's what you remember? - You remember it, don't you? - You make pancakes every day. - Because I'm bored. No. Because you're punishing yourself. You called this place your hell. That means you feel remorse. That's what makes you different than Kai. It means there's hope for you. Look. We can still get out of here, Bonnie. We can just steal that ascendant contraption, find out what Kai knows. We'll ditch him. Because he doesn't have any powers anyway. Actually, it's not that simple. You got to stop doing that. It's creepy. Here's the thing. I have a peculiar effect on magic. I can't generate it myself, but I can consume it from others temporarily. Family called me an abomination. That hurt my feelings. Unh! Ok. We get it. Ugh. You can see why my coven and I didn't get along. I smell an ultimatum. If I consume all of Bonnie's magic, I am just gonna end up killing her, but if we work together, we can all go home as friends, or I can devour her magic, kill you both and go home alone. What's it gonna be? Hello? Ivy. Stefan, I don't feel so good. Your friend Enzo made me drink his blood, and now I'm just so thirsty.
