Damon: Previously on "the Vampire Diaries" My sister's a ghost, and I never got to say goodbye to her.
Matt! Please! Matt.
Vicki? They're looking for Mikael, the vampire who hunts vampires.
You don't want to wake him.
He will kill all of you.
Elena's blood.
Drink it.
Come on.
That's a good sign.
He's flipped the switch.
Stefan is gone.
And he's not coming back.
You can fight it.
You just have to want it bad enough.
Maybe because I love you.
That's right, Stefan.
Because you love me.
Man: The only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl.
Turn it off.
No! Hello! What did you do? I fixed him.
[alarm clock beeps.]
[Sighs.]
Good morning.
So the pressure of your punch ejects the stakes.
Easy enough.
Ugh! That's weird.
Ugh! Unh.
Must be jammed or something.
You're not strong enough.
Better start lifting some weights, put some meat on your bones.
Thanks for not sugar-coating it.
You know what this is? A vervain grenade.
I've used one before.
Then you know the element of surprise is your only advantage when it comes to a vampire.
- Surprise.
- Oh my God! Ugh! This isn't a joke to me, Ric.
You think I'm joking? Vampires will take whatever they want.
They will hurt whoever they want.
And they'll do it without remorse.
It's their nature.
You don't have to use pronouns.
You can say Stefan.
Look, I get why you're here.
Stefan hurt you.
You don't want it to happen again.
But you think that I'm crazy.
To believe that I can protect myself from a vampire who's flipped the switch on his humanity.
I think you found a way to get out of bed this morning.
And that makes you the strongest person I know.
I think that you can do pretty much anything.
Here we are.
Senior year.
Anyone else think it should feel slightly more empowering? Ok.
So prank night was a bust.
But we are accepting it, and we are moving on.
You're right.
I mean, why should I let the fact that my boyfriend is seeing the ghost of his dead girlfriend hinder this experience? Yes! And why should I let the fact that my boyfriend was turned into a hybrid put a damper on an otherwise fabulous day.
Today's our anniversary.
Technically, Stefan and I met on the first day of school last year.
Yeah.
You win.
Are you sure you want to be here? I have to be here.
I have to put it behind me.
New year.
New life.
[Music playing.]
[Girls giggling.]
Stefan: Uh-oh.
Alexandra, left hand, please.
Hey, the 2 brunettes on the staircase owe me a persian rug.
You mean, they owe us a persian rug? It's my house, too, brother.
Ooh! Would you like a spin? So this is what Klaus had in mind when he compelled you to protect Elena? These ladies are helping me be all that I can be.
[Knocking at door.]
- Where's Stefan? - Who the hell are you? He left me here.
My brother actually left me here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Your tone implies that I'm actually supposed to care.
You're Klaus's sister? Rebekah.
Pleasure, I'm sure.
Which one's my room? You're not staying here.
Rude.
Both of you.
I'll see to it myself.
So I guess she's staying here.
So what? It's not cool to talk to juniors anymore? Hey.
Happy first day.
You mad? I'm not mad.
I'm resigned to the fact I'm sharing space in our relationship with Anna and Vicki.
I haven't talked to Vicki in a while.
That's not the point, Jeremy.
I know that.
I know.
Ok? But I had to see Anna again, Bonnie.
She had information that Damon needed.
I get it, Jeremy.
But put yourself in my shoes.
You loved both of them.
And you guys didn't break up.
They died.
And you keep letting them back in.
You think I want any of this? I, um I think you have the power to decide whether or not you see them.
Remember that.
Ok? [Engine stops.]
You were always so much better at being a part of this than I was.
[Sighs.]
Sorry.
You can't just keep appearing like this.
Freaks me out.
I'm a ghost.
It's all I got.
And I couldn't appear if you weren't thinking about me.
Well, I was just thinking about our first day last year.
I was worried about running into Elena and you said Suck it up.
Be a man.
And show her what she's missing.
Yeah.
Instead, she met a vampire.
You ok, Matty? You seem unhappy.
Yeah, I just life stuff.
You know, with you gone and mom not around, it's A lot to deal with alone.
I'm glad I get to talk to you, though.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
What if I told you there was a way that you could help me come back? What do you mean come back? Donovan! What are you doing? Come on, man.
Let's go! You talking to yourself? What's got you in such a good mood? We're seniors, man.
Life is good.
Come on, Mikael, breakfast.
[Cell phone ringing.]
Yummy.
Mikael, wake up! [Phone rings.]
What? What? What do you mean, "what"? I've been calling you for 2 days.
Oh, that's exactly how long I've been ignoring you.
Jeremy Gilbert told me that you found Mikael.
Sort of.
He's a little bit out of commission.
He won't eat.
And I've tried everything Gravediggers, mourners, mice, rats, bats.
He's just not interested.
Well, try harder.
We need him to kill Klaus so I can de-rippefy Stefan before he destroys my house.
Fine.
I'll give it another shot.
[Cell phone rings.]
Hey.
Are you checking up on me? Because I'm fine.
Yeah.
So You might not want to come here for a while.
We have a new housemate.
- Barbie Klaus.
- Rebekah? She's living with you now? Why? She's stranded.
Apparently Klaus left her in the dust after I name-dropped Mikael.
What about Stefan? What is he up to? Oh, you know.
Journaling, reading, shaping his hair.
Come on, Damon.
I can handle it.
What? Is that the bell? Oh Ring! Ring! Don't want to be late.
I forgot about the bonfire.
You have to go.
It's our first spirit squad event.
And it sets the bar for the whole year.
Relax, Caroline.
I'll be there.
Thank you.
It's just that Happy first day.
- Is that blood? - Oh my God! Oh! What's going on?! Vampire 101 don't wear your breakfast to school! Chill out.
It was just a blood bag.
- From where? - Rebekah hooked me up.
Rebekah? And what are you even talking to her for? Klaus told her to keep a watch on me.
Protect his new asset.
His what? Why are you amused by this? I'm his first successful hybrid, Caroline.
Don't you think that's the tiniest bit awesome? Oh, wow! I cannot believe you just said that.
So, I'm going to go.
Come on.
Hello, Elena.
What are you doing here? What do you mean? I'm going back to school.
Go timberwolves! What?! Why? Klaus wants me to keep an eye on you.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
I'm going to be late for class.
Oh, class is this way.
Let go of me, Stefan.
Elena, do you think I want to be a senior for the 100th time? No.
I don't have a choice in the matter.
And neither do you.
I said let go of me.
Let her go.
Don't! Stop it.
You're not going to get in my way.
You hear me? I will see you both in history.
What the hell is he doing here?! Klaus compelled him to watch over me.
Apparently I'm one of Klaus's assets now that my blood is the only way he can create a hybrid.
Now he's a bodyguard? I don't know what he is.
But he's definitely not Stefan.
[School bell rings.]
Look, his being here is not good for any of us.
We have to do something.
Stefan: You're in my seat.
Hey, you.
Welcome back, seniors.
Let's turn our brains back on, starting with this country's original founders Native Americans.
Rebekah: What about the vikings? There's no evidence that viking explorers actually settled in the United States.
Who are you? My name's Rebekah.
I'm new.
And history's my favorite subject.
You've got no business in the stoner pit.
Figured you'd feel comfortable here.
Touche.
So what do you mean that I can help you come back? Right now, I can only come back when you're thinking of me.
But there is a way that I can be free of that.
- How? - I know this sounds crazy.
But I have help from the other side.
The other side? Dude, what are you doing over here? I could ask you the same question.
Just looking for my stoner lab partner.
All right, see you around.
Can he not see you anymore? He was talking to Vicki right out there in the open.
How? When he died and came back, he must have started seeing her.
She said that she could come back, that she had help on the other side.
Help? What kind of help? Who's helping you? The witch I've been talking to says that there's a ritual.
She can do magic from my side to push me over to yours.
Is it even possible? Could she come back? I guess if she had a stronger foothold.
- Like an anchor? - Exactly.
Right now, I'm tethered to you.
My only access point to your side is through you.
But if she were to get a stronger foothold I'll be able to come and go as I please When I want, where I want.
I won't have to rely on you.
But you'll still be a ghost, Vicki.
In a town full of vampires, werewolves, and witches, I'll fit right in.
Seriously.
You're going to make jokes about this? Matt! Relax.
No one else will be able to see me.
She's bad news, Jeremy.
There's nothing but darkness round her.
This is Vicki we're talking about.
All right? She's not a bad person.
You can't upset the balance of nature without a price.
If she's using a witch's energy from the other side, you don't know what price she's going to pay.
I can be a part of this life again, Matt.
Instead of being on the other side all alone.
You won't have to be alone anymore either.
What do I have to do? [Whistle blows.]
Has anybody seen Dana? Sounds like you have an opening on the squad.
What are you doing? Hey.
Hey.
You can't just come here and infiltrate all our lives.
I'm only interested in yours.
Your spark, your popularity.
[Whistle blows.]
Maybe even your boyfriend.
It's not the ballet, ladies.
Let's move! Let's move! I think we're done here, coach.
Did you have a mental breakdown, Lockwood? Get back in line.
I have a better idea.
Shut the hell up so we can go get drunk at the bonfire.
Hit the showers, gentlemen.
[Music playing.]
Try to be a little more subtle, Tyler.
Coming from the queen of subtlety? Relax.
I'm in total control.
Then why are you acting like this? Drop it, Caroline.
I'm fine.
I've never been better.
Klaus has given me this gift.
What?! Boy: Hey, check out the new girl! Girl: Come on, Rebekah.
You move it! [Cheering.]
My God! Damn, girl's got moves.
Look at you being all fit.
Hey, you going to the bonfire tonight? Sounds like fun, right? Seriously, Stefan, leave me alone.
You think I'm annoying now? What till homecoming.
Hey, who you bringing, by the way? I don't want to be weird.
I'm sorry.
Watch it, Dick! Who are you?! I'm the guy who's been assigned to protect a human blood bag.
I mean, no offense or anything.
What?! No! Get it away.
You need blood.
Get it away from me.
Happy? Thank you.
I remember you.
Chicago, 1920s.
You were looking for Klaus.
You're not so scary for a badass vampire vampire Hunter.
[Door closes.]
What? Are you going to bench press a vampire? Do you actually know what's happening right now? Stefan called me a human blood bag.
He's a completely different person.
Unh! - What are you doing? - Helping you out.
- Damon! - Come on, Buffy! Stop it! Like one obnoxious Salvatore isn't bad enough.
You called.
I'm here.
What's your plan, oh warrior princess? I want to lock Stefan up, at least until this Mikael guy comes, kills Klaus, and the compulsion breaks.
Compulsion or not, Stefan's high on human blood.
Ok? A lot of it.
You've gotten him off of it before.
This is different.
It's not a stint in rehab, Elena.
His humanity's gone.
Light's out.
No one's home.
Then do it for me, Damon.
Every single time I look at him, I feel like I'm going to break.
And I'm not going to give him that satisfaction.
What are you doing? Feel that? It's a sternum.
Solid plate of bone.
Right here, just below the ribcage, next to the spine, that's your way to a vampire's heart.
I'll do whatever it is you need me to do, Elena.
No one going to hurt you.
Especially not my brother.
[music playing.]
I'll lure Stefan away from the bonfire.
- Then when he's distracted - I'll shoot him.
Can't Bonnie just ju-ju him or something? I'm trying to keep Bonnie out of this.
I don't trust that Stefan won't hurt her.
- Caroline, are you covered? - Yes! I will make sure that the old Forbes jail cell is prepped and ready.
We're forgetting a key player here.
Rebekah? Wherever Stefan goes, the blond ponytail tends to follow.
Which is why it's your job to keep her away.
How?! She's an original.
Last time I checked, we're out of daggers.
So then preoccupy her with her charm.
Might have better luck finding the dagger.
Are ever not going to be mad at me for a day? Doubtful.
Sorry I'm late.
What's going on? We need you to raid your mom's vervain supply.
Enough to keep Stefan down for a while.
You can't do that to Stefan.
Why not? Trust me, Tyler, it's in his best interest.
Yeah.
It's not in Klaus's.
But Klaus is the bad guy, Tyler.
You know, why are you acting like some freaky, hybrid, slave Minion.
- Damon: Uh-oh.
- What? Klaus made me who I am, Caroline.
- I owe him everything.
- Oh, boy.
Ok, can we cool it on the commentary, please.
Elena: What is going on? I'm just going to go.
Caroline: What are you doing?! - He's been sired.
- What? Sired.
He feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus's blood created him.
Loyal how? He'll seek acceptance from his master.
It's really rare.
But maybe not so much in hybrids.
So how do I fix him? Get a new boyfriend.
You all right there? I thought Tyler would be here.
Tyler, now, huh? Fickle.
When you're willing to give me the time of day again, then we'll talk.
Until then, a girl has needs.
Excuse me.
Elena, hi.
What are you doing? I'm having fun, Stefan.
You got a problem with that? All right, take it easy.
We both know you're kind of a lightweight.
Uh-huh.
Really? You think I'm going to let a blood addict tell me how to drink? Concentrate on me, Matty.
This is too weird.
Just focus.
This is a good thing.
Now say you accept me.
I accept you.
Did you just I felt that.
I feel that, too.
It worked.
Oh! I'm here, Matty! Did you talk to Anna about this? She's on the other side, Bonnie.
Ok.
I thought she might know something.
About what? I thought they were all alone over there.
Somehow Vicki's been communicating with some super strong witch.
If there's another witch involved, don't you think you should have come to me before you went to Anna? Tell her not to be upset.
I was just trying to help.
Not now, Anna.
She's here? She's just trying to help.
I can't I can't deal with this Bonnie! Matt's trying to resurrect his dead sister.
I think I'll go deal with that instead.
Ah, I can feel this.
I can feel everything.
Witch didn't mention this part? Makes sense.
Our deal was that she'd help me do what I need to do.
What are you talking about? What deal, Vic? Well, if I want to stay here, I have to help her restore the balance.
Klaus's hybrids can't be allowed to survive.
You can't kill Tyler, Vicki.
Not Tyler, Matt.
It's Elena who's the key to creating the hybrids.
What? Vicki, no! I'm sorry, Matty.
But I want to stay.
[Chanting "Drink".]
[Music playing.]
What? No friends your own age? Like you can talk.
Is this supposed to be fun? I've been through 10 of these.
No, you're just looking at it all wrong.
This is a little rough on the outside.
But the inside Yum.
Mmm.
It's good.
Yep.
What's that look? [Sighs.]
What look? My brother's got his flirt on, and you're jealous.
I'm not jealous.
It's all right.
Be jealous by all means.
I'm sure Damon will be thrilled.
I'm not jealous, Stefan.
All right.
That's my mistake.
Whatever.
I'm out of here.
Matt! Matt, slow down.
What happened? - I messed up, Bonnie.
- What? How? Where is she? Can't believe you've never had one of these before.
Well, I've been in a casket for 19 years.
That's no excuse.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Why are you being so nice to me? You hate me.
You should be mean.
Well, I could be mean if that's what you're into.
You're distracting me.
Why? Just trying to be a good housemate.
There's no fair fight between us, Damon.
Remember that.
[Groaning.]
What the hell? - How did I get home? - I brought you here.
- You were being a d-bag.
- What is your problem today? My problem is you've been sired.
Do you even know what that means? It means that you put Klaus's needs first.
He is your master now.
I'm not anyone's pet, Caroline.
He doesn't control me.
Well, something's got to be controlling you.
Because I don't know why else you'd be acting like the old you.
The old me? Yeah.
The old you.
The pre-werewolf you.
You know, the obnoxious you that I would never be friends with.
Whoa! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to be that guy.
I hated that guy.
You're a vampire now, Tyler.
Everything about your personality is heightened.
So you have to be careful.
I will.
Promise.
JustDon't hate me.
Everything I like about me is you.
[Sighs.]
I used to know every constellation.
How did I forget them all? You're drunk.
You need to go home.
Fine.
Unh.
Let me find my car.
You're joking, right? Uh-oh.
It's the fun police.
I thought that ripper Stefan was supposed to be the life of the party.
Well, all right, I'm driving you home.
Come on.
What are you, 5? Get down.
Why? Are you afraid that I'm going to ohh.
Ha.
That was close.
Klaus would not be happy with you.
You're hilarious.
Look, Stefan, no hands.
Whoa.
Ha ha.
Aah! I knew you'd catch me.
[Dart gun shots.]
Ugh! You ok? Yeah.
I'm Fine.
You look, uh, not sober.
The plan worked.
That's all that matters.
Let's just get him out of here.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't think she'd do something like this.
I trusted her.
You need to tell me exactly what you did to let Vicki out.
So I know exactly how to send her back.
I see all the geniuses came out to the bonfire tonight.
Elena! Elena! - Open the door.
- I can't! It won't open.
What the hell? I'm sorry, Elena.
I found a spell that can block whatever magic is helping Vicki.
- What do I do? - Give me your hand.
Stefan.
Stefan! Oh, my God.
Phasmotos redux redismo sus terra.
Phasmotos redux redismo sus terra.
Phasmotos redux redismo sus terra.
Phasmotos redux No! Phasmotos redux redismo sus terra.
What is she doing? Fixing my mistake.
Make her stop.
Bonnie The spell is working Matt.
She's still her because of you.
Phasmotos redux Matt, please.
I can't let you hurt anyone, Vicki.
I won't.
I'll stop.
Just, please, don't make me go.
I have to.
This is wrong.
You shouldn't be here.
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want to be alone anymore.
Neither did I.
But I have to let you go.
Phasmotos redux redismo sus terra.
Phasmotos redux redismo sus terra.
Goodbye, Vicki.
Phasmotos redux redismo sus terra.
She's gone.
Hurry up before it blows.
Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Elena: Give it to me.
I can do it.
- No, let me.
- Damon, come on.
Elena, you almost got barbecued.
The least I can do is apply first aid.
There.
You played your part of the plan really well tonight.
Oh, yeah? You had Rebekah drooling all over you and your marshmallows.
Yeah, before she skewered me.
I thought you were too drunk to notice.
I was faking most of it.
So was I.
[Music playing.]
Alaric: Ready to get going, Elena? Great work tonight, Ric.
Sorry about the car, man.
Bummer.
You're always running out on me.
You have to earn the overnighter.
- I consider that a challenge.
- Ha ha.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What are you doing here? I have something for you.
- What? - A little present.
You should go.
You sure? I think my brother would want his hybrid to indulge in everything life has to offer.
I apologize for my outburst.
It would have made more sense had you known that I've been denying myself human blood for as long as I can remember.
Why is it that you awoke me? I thought you might know how to kill Klaus.
But something tells me that I've been sorely misinformed.
Would you mind helping me with these? I can assure you there's no way I can kill Klaus from beneath them.
Does that you mean you do know how to kill him? I can kill Klaus.
And I will.
Thank you.
A little blood will grease those muscles up real quick.
Just saying I don't feed on living things.
Then what do you eat? It's ok if you want to be friends with Damon again.
I don't.
I think he kind of misses you.
[Sighs.]
Well you got me tonight.
Definitely wasn't expecting that.
That was the point.
Yeah.
You know, you can hate it all you want, but Elena needs me.
I'll always protect her.
I think you're both better off having me around.
Elena, wait.
You could have let me die in that fire tonight.
Why didn't you? Because I still have hope.
After everything I've done, you You still think I'll be able to find my humanity again.
Yes, I do.
I know who you really are better than anyone, Stefan.
And I'm not giving up.
Elena, do you have any idea how pathetic that makes you? No, Stefan, it makes me strong.
[Door closes.]
Bonnie, come on.
Stop dodging my calls.
Don't you think we should at least talk about this? I shouldn't be here.
No kidding.
No, I mean, I shouldn't be here, Jeremy.
Why are you thinking about me when you're calling her? I didn't think I was.
Look, I don't know.
Ok.
I don't know what I'm doing, Anna.
The problem is I don't think I can stop thinking about you.
I can't stop thinking about you, either.
What are we going to do? Do youFeel this? What's going on? I can feel you.
How can I feel you? Keep it up, Stefan.
[Rattling.]
This is going to be fun.
