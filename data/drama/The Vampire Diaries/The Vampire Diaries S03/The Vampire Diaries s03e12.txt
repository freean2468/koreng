Damon: Previously on "The Vampire Diaries" You took everything from me, Klaus.
Let bygones be bygones.
Resentment gets old.
You know what never gets old? Revenge.
No.
What's a matter, Klaus? Missing something? Three sleeping originals, four coffins.
Who is in the locked box? He's been sired.
Feels loyal to Klaus because Klaus' blood created him.
He released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
I need you to bite your girlfriend.
A hybrid bite would kill a vampire.
Consider this me putting your undying loyalty to the test.
Klaus can't control me.
Not when it comes to you.
Ahhh.
Oh! Oh, no.
Did you justBite me?! Caroline! Get away from me! [Bird squawking.]
I figured out how to open it.
Can you? [Bonnie shrieks.]
[Bonnie breathing heavily.]
[Thud.]
[Bonnie gasping.]
[Thudding continues, cell phone beeps.]
Let me out! Please! [Gasping.]
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
[Chanting in latin.]
[Thudding.]
[Grunting and gasping.]
[Footsteps.]
Hey! I'm in here! I'm in here! [Screaming.]
I'm in here! Bonnie: I've been having these dreams for days now.
It's like the witches are trying to send me a message.
Elena: I just can't believe you guys have kept this from me this whole time.
Stefan thought if you knew where the coffins were, Klaus could threaten people to get the information out of you.
[Sighs.]
So these are the rest of his family? Yeah, Elijah and two others.
Now this one Is the one we can't open.
We don't know who's in it or what's in it, only that I think my dream's telling me to help kill Klaus.
What the hell are you doing? I needed her to know about the coffin.
And I needed you to keep her out of it, Bonnie.
So what are you going to do, Stefan? Are you going to kidnap me so that I won't tell anyone? [Chuckles.]
Don't tempt me, Elena.
I think I know who can open the coffin, Stefan.
And I need Elena to help me find her.
Find who? What are you talking about? I couldn't place her face at first.
Then I realized Oh, my God, Bonnie.
Who is this? It's my mom.
Los alamitos? Um, too old.
Honolulu? Ugh, I wish.
How many of these are there? A lot.
I asked the sheriff's office to pull up every single Abby Bennett in the country.
I know we haven't been able to really That things have been weird because of Jeremy.
So thank you for helping me with this.
I know you have a lot to deal with.
There's nothing more important, Bonnie.
It's surreal.
Having to track down a woman who bailed on her own kid.
You know you don't have to, right? Let Stefan obsess over opening up the coffin.
It doesn't have to fall on you.
The coffin is spelled shut.
That makes it a witch problem.
So it does fall on me.
I was bound to see my mother again sooner or later.
Sooner.
Abby Bennett Wilson, Monroe, North Carolina.
Born in Mystic Falls hospital, graduated Mystic Falls High, blah, blah, blah.
A little compulsion helps to speed up the research process.
This is her.
Yep, road trip.
I call shotgun.
Yeah, no.
Why? You want me to hang out in the back with you? You're not coming, Damon.
Why? I'm the one who found her.
Ok, Damon, look, Bonnie hasn't seen her mom in over 15 years.
We don't need your snarky commentary narrating the experience.
What's going on with you two? We kissed.
Now it's weird.
Have a great trip.
What are you doing here? I came to apologize.
[Chuckles.]
Apologize? You bit me.
I could have died.
I think we're way past apologies, Tyler.
That's the problem.
Klaus told me to do it and I said no.
And then, it just happened anyway.
Like it was completely out of my control.
[Scoffs.]
That's why I had your mom call him.
Daddy? Hi, Caroline.
I thought since he could resist compulsion, maybe he could teach me to resist a sire bond.
Can you help him? I'm going to try.
Why? Because he made a mistake.
And now he wants to make good.
And I understand that.
Do you want anything else? A beer? Ah, I'd love one, but I've got rounds in 15 minutes.
And a drunk doctor is a bad doctor.
Well, that depends on what kind of drunk you are.
Angry.
Oh.
[Both laugh.]
Thanks for lunch.
Yeah, sure.
Ah, so, um, next time, dinner? Yeah, that would be great.
Cool.
Take care.
Bye.
Thanks.
Who's that? My doctor.
She's a doctor? Ooh.
What's her damage? No damage.
Come on, Ric, it's a fact of life.
A girl that hot, that smartDamage.
Well, you know, I'm looking for red flags.
Her, uh, her ex called her a psycho case the other day.
Yeah, but if it comes from her ex, it doesn't count.
I guess you're right.
It's yours.
I wonder what my exes would call me.
Nothing.
They're all dead.
Hmm.
Well, her ex is the medical examiner, so he's dead-adjacent.
She dated the medical examiner? Mm-hmm.
Well, I don't think he's dead-adjacent.
I think he's just dead.
What? Murdered.
Sheriff's trying to keep a lid on it because he was staked in the chest like a vampire.
Well, Meredith didn't say anything about that.
Well, red flag number two.
Who do you think killed him? I don't know.
But if I was a cop, your sexy doctor lady friend would definitely be a suspect.
[Rock music playing loudly.]
[Music fades.]
What are you doing here, Klaus? Enjoying our stalemate.
What do you want? Question is, what do you want? My hybrids left town as you demanded, so please tell me what I need to do to get my family back.
Well, ahem, see, Klaus I'm not negotiating.
And you understand that holding them indefinitely is the same thing as dropping them in the ocean? No, no, you leave Mystic Falls and then give me a call in a few years, andWe'll talk.
I'm going to give you another chance.
Just one more.
Let's make a reasonable deal.
Or what? You make one move, and I will [Laughs.]
Yes, that's right.
Crazy Stefan.
Mmm.
How's that working out for you? Any friends left? Bonnie: I just can't believe I'm actually going to see her.
Or meet her.
Sort of.
Since I don't really remember her.
You don't really talk about her.
What's to say? She left, never wrote, never called.
Not even when my grams died.
Can we talk about you and Damon instead? I'm not talking about it.
He kissed me.
It's not going to happen again.
I mean Was it good? It doesn't matter.
That means it was.
[Cell phone rings.]
It's Stefan.
I told him I'd call him as soon as I got the address.
Ignore.
Bonnie, you're about to see your mom for the first time in 15 years.
I'm not letting anyone ruin that moment.
Yeah, but he's going to keep at it until I pick up.
[Ring.]
Fine.
What? Where are you? Bonnie and I are going to spend the night at the lake house while we wait for sheriff Forbes to give us some more addresses.
You're kidding me, right? No, Stefan, I'm not.
We need a night off from your insanity.
Klaus is getting antsy.
He knows I'm stalling him.
We need to move faster.
Well, we're doing everything we can.
So could you maybe not call every 5 minutes? Sure, Elena.
Whatever you say.
Klaus: How's life on the road? Daniel: Scenic.
How's life in Mystic Falls without any hybrids? Boring.
For now.
If you want any of us back, you just have to say the word.
There's no need.
I've been making friends with the town's civil servants.
There's a deputy who's awfully chatty, but useful nonetheless.
Are you clear on what you need to do? I've got it covered.
[Knocks on door.]
Can I help you? Abby Bennett Wilson? That's me.
Elena: Cute house.
Bonnie: For the middle of nowhere.
You ready? Come on.
[Doorbell rings.]
Man: Hey there.
Hey, we're looking for, um, Abby Wilson.
She's not home.
Is there anything I can do for you? That's ok, we can come back.
I'm sorry, but you look so familiar.
Yeah, Abby's my mom.
Oh.
I'm Jamie.
Um, you guys want to come inside? Right this way.
You guys sure you don't want anything? We got fresh O.
J.
, coconut water, some mango guava something.
Water's fine.
Cool.
[Water running.]
So, ahem, are we, like, related? Oh, no.
Uh, Abby's not my mom.
Oh.
Good.
Yeah, she, uh, she dated my old man back in the day.
He was kind of a deadbeat, so when they broke up, she took me in.
Put me through school.
Didn't freak out when I totaled her car.
Twice.
[Chuckles.]
[Chuckles.]
She soundsGreat.
Yeah.
Abby: Jamie? Whose car's out front? That's mine.
I'm Bonnie.
Your daughter.
[Exhales.]
Hello, Bonnie.
How do you know this is going to work? It's a process.
It took decades to train myself to resist compulsion.
The brain's like a muscle.
The more you use it, the more it can do.
A sire bond, at its core, is about one thing Gratitude.
If you believe you owe Klaus your life, ask yourself why.
I was cursed.
Every full moon, I had to change into a wolf.
It was torture.
Klaus took that away.
Freed you from your pain and you feel indebted to him.
To break the sire bond, you've to make yourself turn.
Own your pain, then you'll owe Klaus nothing and you'll be free.
But how can he turn? It's not a full moon.
He doesn't need one.
You're a hybrid now, right? I mean, you can turn at will or not, am I right? Yeah, but I don't know how to justStart.
Now you're making excuses.
You don't understand! When I turn, I break every bone in my body.
You asked for my help.
This is the only way.
How badly do you want your freedom? Ok.
Ok.
[Gasping.]
[Bones snapping, screaming.]
Elena: How are you holding up? Oh.
I'll be fine.
I'm not here to get my mom back, I'm just here to get her help.
So I hope you guys are hungry.
'Cause, uh, food has always been my go-to icebreaker.
You have a really beautiful home.
You're so sweet.
Just like your mom.
You knew my mom? Miranda was my best friend.
So you had a daughter and a best friend and you still left? My best friend is why I left.
a vampire came to town.
Looking for you, Elena.
Looking for the doppelganger.
No one could manage to kill him, so I lured him out of town and cast a spell to desiccate him.
Mikael.
He was an original vampire.
It took every ounce of power I had.
Almost killed me.
I recovered.
But my magic didn't.
My powers never came back.
And neither did you.
It wasn't that simple.
It wasn't? You cast a spell, put Michael down, then What? You had to teach Jamie how to drive? Bonnie This was a mistake.
She has no magic, she can't help us.
Bonnie, wait, please.
Don't go.
Talk to me.
Please? Elena: I'll wait outside.
[Bird squawking.]
Hi, Elena.
Nice lake house.
You know, we never got a chance to officially meet, doctorFell.
You're Alaric's friend, right? Damon Salvatore.
Saw you at the council meeting.
What are you doing here? Strolling the halls.
I like to wave at the newborns through the window.
Sorry about your boyfriend.
Animal attack.
Brutal.
Ex-boyfriend.
And thanks.
I'm still kind of processing.
Yeah, I'm sure.
You know, I just thought I'd come by and tell you that it wasn't an animal attack.
And then I realized.
You signed the death certificate.
Would you rather I say he was staked like a vampire? Wasn't he the guy that coined the phrase "animal attack"? Why do you even care? Because Ric likes you.
And if you're a psychopath, it would probably really suck for him.
You think I killed my ex-boyfriend? I think psychopaths are incredibly high-maintenance.
If you care about your friend, go figure out how Alaric came into the icu on his deathbed and walked out an hour later without a scratch.
Fair enough.
[Screaming and groaning.]
I can't.
I can't.
Try harder.
Can't he just rest for one second?! We're doing this my way, Caroline.
If you can't handle it, you should go.
He's right, Caroline.
Just go.
No! Tyler! Go, Caroline.
[Gasping.]
What are you doing? [Groaning.]
What the hell, man? Does it bother you? Knock it off! Good.
Get angry.
It's in you.
You know it is.
I said knock it off! [Gasping.]
Your bond to Klaus is putting my daughter in danger.
Now either you turn or I kill you right here, right now.
[Screaming and groaning.]
You've grown into such a beautiful young woman, Bonnie.
Please, just stop with the muffins and the compliments.
I just want to know the truth Why didn't you come home? [Exhales.]
I had no magic.
I was in a new city, and I realized I had a chance to be somebody else.
To be Abby Wilson, the woman Not Abby Bennett, the witch.
I'm not proud of what I did, Bonnie.
I ran.
I know I ran.
But you had your dad and your grams, and, ok, let's face it Your grams is way better at this stuff than I am.
You don't know? What? Oh.
How? We were doing a rough spell And we both exhausted ourselves.
[Inhales.]
Her more than me.
[Exhales.]
Well, she raised you right.
I'm sure she was very proud of you.
Well, now you know my whole story.
Yep.
[Chuckles.]
How about you tell me yours? [Sighs.]
What brings you to me? It was a dream, actually.
I thought you were supposed to help us.
But if you don't have any magic, it's Well, no spells, no.
But I'm not completely useless.
I mean, the earth still provides herbs and such.
There might be something I can do.
IDon't think so.
Bonnie, please.
Let me help you.
So what, you'd think I wouldn't find out? Honestly, I didn't care.
This is exactly why I didn't want you in the loop, Elena.
Yeah, because now you can't do whatever you want.
Damn it! Jamie: Hey! Everything all right out here? Hey.
Jamie, go back inside, ok? Please.
Trust me.
It's better off for you there.
I don't think so.
I'd listen to her.
Get back upstairs, man.
I said I don't think so.
Get back upstairs before I tear your damn throat out, do you understand me? I don't think you realize how bad you've gotten! This is the way it has to be, Elena.
Oh, yeah, right.
Out-villain the villain.
I get it.
[Cocks gun.]
You're not supposed to be here.
Jamie, what are you doing? What I was told.
He's not supposed to be here.
Elena, he's compelled.
[Gunshot.]
What was that?! Alaric: What are you doing here? Ah, looking for a bunny.
You're good.
For now.
You still obsessed with Meredith? Ah.
I mean, don't you have an original vampire to worry about? Ah, ah, ah, do ten more of those.
You're going to want to buff up if you start dating this one.
Self defense and all.
What is your problem? Your doctor vervained me.
And then she bloodjacked me.
What? I mean, when did you even see her? When I went to the hospital to accuse her of killing her ex-boyfriend.
Which, by the way, very sensitive subject.
Damon, what the hell are you doing, huh? Why are you mad at me? I told you I'd handle this! I proved your theory Diagnosed psycho case.
You're welcome.
Elena: Why are you doing this? Stop moving.
[Stefan groaning.]
Jamie, let me go.
Jamie, he needs help.
Abby: Jamie! Bonnie! Bonnie! [Groaning.]
[Grunting.]
[Screaming and groaning.]
What the These chains aren't strong enough.
You need to leave.
Run! [Screaming and groaning.]
[Crickets chirping.]
So? She didn't tell me where the coffins are.
The vampire showed up.
Did Jamie take care of him? He did.
But she's not going to talk now.
There's no way.
I tried.
Well, you should try again.
What did you do to me? You'll be fine.
But don't try and use spells.
Those herbs I used muted your magic.
Where's Elena?! She'll be fine, too.
Bonnie, listen to me.
I need your help.
I need you to tell me where those coffins are.
Why? Because if you don't, that man compelled Jamie to kill himself.
I can't.
This goes beyond you and me.
All you need to do is tell me where they are.
Then we'll have held up our end of the bargain.
Bonnie, please.
[Stefan groaning.]
Elena: I've almost got it.
[Groaning.]
Abby hasn't called yet.
Jamie, please, just let us go.
No! Please, don't do anything.
Look, I don't know why I shot him.
I don't know why I'm holding this gun, but if you move or do anything, I'm going to shoot him again.
Ok, I won't.
Who gave you that gun? A man came by here earlier today.
He said it was wooden buckshot.
Told me if anyone got in our way, I'm supposed to shoot 'em.
What else did he say? If Abby didn't find the location of some coffins I'm supposed to shoot myself.
What about me? What did he say about me? I'm not supposed to hurt you.
[Exhales.]
Are you sure? Because These ropes are so tight that it is hurting me.
[Groaning.]
What can I do to help? Every time I move, the wood shifts inside of me.
I can feel it scraping against my heart.
You need to get the pieces out.
[Groaning.]
[Sighs.]
Aahh! What took you so long? I've been hiding behind your witchy friends.
And in squalor, no less.
[Screaming.]
Insulting a bunch of dead witches Not smart.
I made the exact same mistake first time I came in here.
Well, you know the funny thing about the witches is that living or dead, they care about their own.
[Grunting.]
A hundred dead witches have a thousand living descendents [Screaming.]
And I have no problem killing every last one of them if I don't get my coffins back.
As we speak, my hybrid friend is prepared to end the Bennett line.
[Grunting.]
Now.
Please Show me the coffins.
Here we are.
Where's the fourth? Show me! Well, ehh, here's the thing.
They can't.
It's not here.
What did you do? Well, Bonnie gave me the head's up.
I mean, I didn't have enough time to get all four, but I did have time to get one.
I will tear you limb from limb.
And only then, when you are a writhing mass of blood and flesh, will I rip your heart from your chest.
Sorry.
Same rules apply.
Leverage and all.
I know you want your family back.
But something tells me you want what's in that coffin a lot more.
You want to tell me what you're up to? You talked to Damon.
Yeah, I did.
He wasn't supposed to wake up so soon.
I used enough vervain to sedate him for hours.
Well, he drinks it, every day.
To build up an immunity so people like you don't get the jump on him.
I'm not crazy, Ric.
Really? Then what are you? Watch your back.
You really want to know? Stick around.
Is that bill Forbes? [Grunting.]
[Groaning.]
Aaah! I'm just trying to help! Just get it out, Elena, please.
Just get it out.
If you keep squirming, maybe I'll feel sorry for you.
[Groaning.]
You've changed.
Something's different about you.
You're stronger.
Tougher.
You're not the only one who changed, Stefan.
We all had to.
[Chuckles.]
That's good to know.
There's something I have to tell you.
And it's not because I feel guilty that it happened.
It's because I feel guilty that you don't know.
[Both grunting.]
I kissed Damon.
There.
All done.
Alaric: What happened to him? Meredith: He was found in the woods.
An actual animal attack.
Bite marks and gashes over half his body.
Lost about Well, is he going to make it? Nope.
At least not on his own.
What is that? Exactly what you think it is.
Vampire blood.
You wanted to know my secret? I cheat.
I'm a doctor and I hate when people die.
So when I have the ability to do something about it, I do.
[Crickets chirping.]
Stefan [Sighs.]
Say something.
Please.
I shouldn't have kidnapped you.
The car, the bridge, it was too far.
Thank you.
But you shouldn't have lied to me today.
You can't go off and do things like that, Elena.
Not while Klaus is still alive.
I know.
I justI wanted to give Bonnie a moment with her mother without everything else getting in the way.
Without me getting in the way.
I didn't plan on kissing him.
You're better than him, Elena.
You're better than both of us.
[Music playing.]
Elena's on her way.
Jamie's safe.
He's a little bruised, but he's safe.
Do you think the hybrid will come back? You kept your end of the bargain.
Klaus usually keeps his.
[Exhales.]
You're willing to do all of this for him And he's not even your family.
He is my family, Bonnie.
I know that might be hard for you to hear, but he is.
But that doesn't mean that I don't care about you.
I want to help you.
You can't.
You have no magic and I don't trust you.
When I put mikael down, my magic didn't just leave me.
It drifted away.
The longer I stayed away from you, the weaker it got.
I think nature was punishing me for abandoning you.
Maybe you can help me get my magic back.
I thought you said you didn't want it anymore.
I don't.
But if it's what you wanted I would do that for you.
You're better.
Yeah.
I shouldn't be, but I didn't have any say in the matter.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I lost control.
Again.
I knew the risks when I decided to help you.
So Was it worth it? How do you feel? Different.
A little more myself.
Then we'll continue tomorrow.
What are you talking about? I turned.
Once.
To break the sire bond.
Turning needs to be painless.
And from what I saw today We're still a long way off.
I can't put myself through that again.
You will.
Because until you're capable of acting on your own free will, I'm not going to let you anywhere near my daughter.
You told me your secret.
This is mine.
You're a vampire hunter.
Ah, semi-retired.
You're trying to get out of taking me to dinner, aren't you? Just want to be honest.
No secrets.
Ok.
Then tell me how you survived getting hit by a truck.
Your injuries were fatal.
Was it vampire blood? That, and, uh This ring protects me from death at the hands of supernatural beings.
A vampire hunter who can't be killed by vampires.
Convenient.
[Chuckles.]
Are you worried I'm a supernatural being? One can never be Too careful.
[Door slams.]
Oh, um, hey, um.
Sorry.
Oh, uh, I'm gonna go.
Ok, yeah, sure, sure, sure.
Elena, I am I'm sorry.
Please, it it's ok.
Ah, it's not ok, Elena.
I mean, this is not even my place.
It's it's your place.
It's Jenna's place.
It's your family It's your family's place.
The minute that you slept on that couch, it became your place, too.
We needed you, and [Exhales.]
And you stayed.
Sp thank you for that.
Hey, look, I know it's hard.
But Jenna's gone.
And you're allowed to move on.
Oh, you're still alive? I assume that means Klaus didn't get his coffins.
Well, don't look so happy.
I was only able to get one of them out in time.
The locked one.
Probably a good choice.
Yeah.
You know, if you're banking on Bonnie's mama to open it, you're screwed.
She doesn't have any powers.
Ah.
Doesn't surprise me.
It's been that kind of night.
Is Elena ok? [Groans.]
I take it you two had a heart to heart.
And I take it you don't want to talk about it.
Noted.
So why don't we talk about this? What did you do? You've got your family back.
Finally.
You're going to open them? Not quite yet.
I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
What business? [Groaning.]
So, Niklaus Elijah? What did I miss?
