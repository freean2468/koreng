Previously on "The Vampire Diaries" The only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl.
Your humanity is killing you.
Turn it off! -What did you do? -I fixed him.
-What did you do? -I fixed him.
Fight for it.
Feel something.
Anything, Stefan.
'Cause if you don't, you're going to lose me forever.
I've heard about you.
Crazy, impulsive vampire.
In love with his brother's girl.
As long as Klaus is alive, I do what he says.
What the hell did you do? He's earned his freedom.
I had Klaus.
This could have all been over.
We'll survive this.
We're never getting Stefan back.
Then we'll let him go.
-What now? -Now, I reunite my family.
-What now? -Now, I reunite my family.
You mean, the people you cart around in caskets.
What's the matter, Klaus I will kill you and everyone you've ever met.
Do that, and you will never see your family again.
Excuse me.
I should have been watching where I was going.
Don't worry about it.
You have a nice day.
I think I'm going crazy.
I'm totally paranoid all the time.
You have a right to be.
Klaus is sill out there, and he knows you tried to kill him.
Why hasn't he made a move? There's been no sign of him, nothing.
Just my slow spiral into insanity.
Join the club.
Every time I close my eyes, I have that nightmare on repeat.
-The same dream? -Yeah.
-The same dream? -Yeah.
It's weird.
What if it's not just Some dream? What if it's, like, you know, a witch dream? It's just stress.
What about Stefan He betrayed us, Bonnie.
The Stefan that we know is gone.
How is Damon handling that? Damon is Damon.
Uh, you have your choice Bloody Mary, screwdriver.
Brunch in a bottle.
Come on, Ric.
I can't drink all this by myself.
I mean, I can, but then.
Somebody's getting naked.
Oh, man.
I can't believe you're making me drink alone.
I'm busy.
It's the eve of Klausageddon.
You're doing homework? This may come as a shock, but I am not here to hang out with you.
I'm here to see Jeremy, who is an hour late for his shift.
Kids today.
Where are their values? That's his midterm paper.
Copied it straight off the internet.
Didn't even try to hide it.
Ooh.
Somebody's getting grounded.
Did you say you were waiting for Jeremy As in Jeremy Gilbert? Yeah.
He was fired last week.
Oops.
Nice shot.
So what's the point of this, again? The point is I'm pissed at Caroline, and Bonnie dumped your ass.
The point Is to get drunk and shoot stuff.
Profound.
Alaric finds out I took this, he's going to use it on me.
So, what's the deal with that? He's, like, your guardian now? Sort of, yeah.
I think he feels responsible for us.
You like him? Yeah.
Yeah.
I like him.
Hey, you want to move out of the way? I'm a hybrid, Gilbert.
You can't kill me unless you cut off my head or rip out my heart.
And you're not going to do it with that lame-ass crossbow.
Go ahead.
Take a shot.
Unless you don't think you can hit me.
Jeremy, the minute that you get this, call me.
You're feisty when you're mad.
It's not that I'm mad.
I'm just I'm worried.
Why I think he'll survive, Elena.
He's spiraling.
Ever since Bonnie broke up with him, he's moody.
He's not really talking to anyone.
Just a typical teenager.
Who's seeing ghosts and who's lost everyone that he cares about.
Not everyone.
He still has you.
You ok? What makes you think I'm not ok? Well, you're a day drunk.
It's not exactly your most attractive look.
Oh.
What is my most attractive look? Uh-uh.
I'm not saying you have any attractive look.
I'm just Saying this is my least favorite one.
Noted.
See if I can make any improvements.
Don't mind me.
Oh.
You going to do this in the grill, in front of everyone? It's a little beneath you, don't you think? I don't know what you're talking about.
I just came down to my local pub.
to grab a drink with a mate.
Get a round, then, would you, Tony? I'm surprised you stuck around town.
Long enough for happy hour.
My sister seems to be missing.
Need to sort that out.
Cute, blonde bombshell Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Truth is, I've grown to rather like your little town.
Thinking I might fancy a home here.
I imagine you're wondering how does this affect you.
And the answer is, not in the slightest.
As long as I get what I want, and everyone behaves themselves, you can go on living your little lives however you choose.
You have my word.
What more could you possibly want? Well, for starters, you can tell me where I might find Stefan.
Stefan skipped town the second he saved your ass.
Well, you see, that is a shame.
Your brother stole from me.
I need him found so I can take back what's mine.
That sounds like a Klaus and Stefan problem.
Well, this is me broadening the scope, sweetheart.
Hello, Bonnie.
Stefan.
-You followed me here? -Yeah.
-You followed me here? -Yeah.
It wasn't too hard.
You should probably be more careful.
What do you want with me? Relax.
I just need your help.
Why would I help you? Elena said you saved Klaus's life.
Let me fill you in on a little secret about Klaus.
He kept his family with him at all times, Daggered, stored in coffins.
And now, I have them.
And I need you to help keep them hidden.
You're out of your mind.
You're just going to make him angrier.
His family is his one weakness.
As long as I have that, I can ruin him.
I don't have enough power to hide 4 originals.
You're a witch.
You hate Klaus.
I know you can figure something out.
You ready? Vampires, hybrids, and originals.
No problem.
My rebellious brother I'm worried.
Proof you're still human.
Just in time.
We're cooking.
Sorry.
Just passing through.
Aww.
Well, I thought we'd all stay in, Have a meal together like a typical atypical family.
-Why? -Maybe because you got fired.
-Why? -Maybe because you got fired.
And you didn't tell anyone.
Look, can we do this later? I made plans with Tyler.
He's right outside.
Wait.
When did you start hanging out with Tyler Rockwell? I don't know.
Does it matter? Yeah, Jeremy, it matters.
He was sired by Klaus.
He's dangerous.
He can still hear you.
He's right outside.
Besides, you of all people are going to lecture me.
on who I can and can't hang out with? What is with the attitude? Whatever.
This is lame.
Tyler's waiting.
No.
Oh, no, no.
You're not going anywhere, especially not with Tyler.
I'm with her on this, Jer.
Sorry.
All right.
Fine.
You want me to stay in? Let's all stay in, then.
Yo, Tyler, come on in.
Jeremy I think it's about time we had a drink, don't you? I'd say we're overdue.
Well, you've been so busy, what with all your plotting and scheming.
You know me Never miss a chance to plan an epic failure.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Who could have guessed your own brother would betray you? Well, I did have a front row seat when your sister lied to you.
Yeah, well, she's fickle, that one.
And you say you have no idea of her whereabouts? That's the thing with younger siblings.
You just never know what they're going to do.
Drink? Thanks.
This is weird.
Klaus has hybrids stalking me, and now, you're just sitting in our kitchen.
Look, maybe I should go.
No, stay.
You're not doing anything.
Unless you have to, you know, check in with your hybrid master.
It's not like that, Elena.
Tell me, Tyler What is the difference.
Between being sired and being compelled? Compulsion That's just mind control, like hypnosis.
And being sired is It's like faith.
You do something because you believe it's the right thing.
So, you believe that serving Klaus is the right thing.
I don't serve him.
Klaus released me from a curse that was ruining my life.
I owe him for that.
What if he asked you to Jump off a bridge? He wouldn't.
And even if he did, I'd be fine.
I'm a hybrid.
Ok.
So what if he asked you to rip your own heart out? Again, he wouldn't.
What if he did? I don't know.
Then I'd rip out my heart.
You guys sound like Caroline, getting all freaked out over something you don't understand.
You're right, Tyler.
I don't understand.
Klaus has terrorized every single one of us, and you're just blindly loyal to him.
You're overthinking it.
I can still make my own decisions.
Cheers, mate.
Down the hatch.
You know, we've actually got a lot in common, you and I.
-Really? -Heh.
-Really? -Heh.
Well, yeah.
Maybe we can Bond over our mutual loathing of my brother.
Why are you so mad at him? He stole something? My family.
The originals.
I had them daggered, boxed up, awaiting the day when I saw fit to wake them.
And he went in and pinched the bloody lot.
Of course he did.
Ah, such a buzz kill, my baby bro.
Well, I'd love to find him.
Just the trouble is I sure as hell don't work for you.
You know, your drink stinks of vervain, so I can't compel you.
There'd be no point in killing you, because you're actually the one with the most hope of getting me what I need.
And yet, it would seem a demonstration is in order.
Perhaps I wasn't clear enough when I told you to find Stefan.
Oh, well.
It seems you people respond best to displays of violence.
Why don't you take this as an example of my reach? There he is.
So, that thing I told you to do.
Why don't you go ahead and get on with it? -What was that about? -It was nothing.
-What was that about? -It was nothing.
I got to go.
Um, thanks for the food offer, but next time Ahem.
Well, that was illuminating.
So, Tyler Lockwood is.
A lunatic who has access to our house.
I mean, this whole sire bond thing is wild.
I don't even think Tyler's fully aware of.
What little reason lies behind what he's saying.
It's it's his weird cult logic.
Well, great.
That's a wonderful influence for you, Jer.
Jeremy? That's his ring.
Where'd he go? Jeremy? What is he doing? Oh, my god.
Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy, move! There I go again, bumping into people.
That's Klaus' hybrid.
He's going to be all right.
Are you ok? I don't understand.
Who was that on the phone earlier? It was Klaus.
You were compelled, Jeremy.
We've got to get him inside.
Help me.
Compel the men to open up this wall.
We need sun.
I want a fortress, not a dungeon.
There he is.
Man of the hour.
So everything went ok? Tony ran down Alaric instead of Jeremy, but apples, oranges.
Message learns the same.
You said you were sending them a warning.
And I did an effective one.
Elena's family suffers, she's motivated to get me what I want.
I didn't think that we'd actually have to kill anyone.
Tyler, mate.
What you're feeling is the remnant of a guilty conscience.
I need you to get over it, ok? End of the day, human life here is just a means to an end Our means to our end.
You'd do well to remember that.
How is he? He's dead, but he had his ring.
Klaus' hybrid hit him.
Now we just wait.
Jeremy, why aren't you wearing vervain I don't know.
It was Tyler.
It had to have been.
That's why he was hanging out with you, to get you off the vervain.
Klaus is trying to send us a message.
He wants us to find Stefan, who stole his coffins of all his dead family members.
-Coffins? -Yep.
-Coffins? -Yep.
So all we have to do is find 4 coffins, and voila, no one else on your family's christmas list has to die.
Wait, that's your big plan, to steal back 4 dead originals.
So this evil hybrid doesn't kill me.
And everyone else we know? -You got a better idea? -Yeah.
-You got a better idea? -Yeah.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Pack our bags and go.
Hey, Jeremy, calm down.
No.
No, I'm not going to calm down, Elena.
This happens every time no matter what we do You get on my case about school and work.
Who cares.
None of us are going to make it out of this town alive.
He said he wants his family back.
No.
No, I know what you're thinking.
The answer's no.
If we give him Rebekah Yeah, then Klaus un-daggers her.
First thing she does is kill you.
Frying pan, fire.
Not an option.
Klaus's coffins.
How many did you say there were? Elena? Hey.
Klaus is looking for 4 coffins, just like in your dream.
I think it's not just stress.
Elena, don't get involved.
Whatever Klaus wants, stay as far away from it as you can.
Klaus won't let me.
Bonnie He tried to kill Jeremy.
What do you want me to do? We need to find Stefan.
Look, I know that you don't think.
That your locater spell still works, but we have to at least try.
We don't need a locater spell.
Bonnie said this place lost all its mojo.
The dead witches were angry at her for bringing Jeremy back to life.
I guess now they have something they want her to know.
That's why I hate witches.
So fickle, passive-aggressive.
Stefan? Come on, Stef.
Olly olly oxen free.
Really What? The witchy spirits aren't a big fan, and they used their juju to screw with my daylight ring.
-Then wait outside.
-Elena I'm not leaving until I know if he's here.
Stefan? Go away.
You shouldn't be here, Elena.
Stefan, I need your help.
Bonnie said that you would be here.
Well, Bonnie sucks at keeping secrets.
Listen, you need to give Klaus his family back.
Oh, really Klaus compelled Jeremy to stand in front of a speeding car.
Don't you get it? Stefan, he's not going to stop until he gets what he wants Elena, stop talking.
I'm not giving Klaus anything.
Are you listening to me? He's going to kill Jeremy.
Not really my problem.
You can go to hell.
That didn't go over well.
Don't even start, Damon.
Let me talk to him.
You can't get in.
The witches won't let you.
Here.
Take my car keys.
You go deal with your brother.
I'll deal with mine.
Wow.
That was impressive.
But the coffins aren't here, so you can go away now.
I don't care about the coffins.
We need to talk.
Ohh! Ow! Ok.
Let's talk.
Nothing's ever easy with you, is it? That is for screwing up my plan.
-Ugh! -You stopped me from killing Klaus, and you steal his family.
Why? It doesn't make sense.
Answer me! Piece by piece, Klaus took everything from me.
I'm doing the same to him.
But I had him, Stefan! Aah! -Why'd you screw it up? -I did it to save you! -Why'd you screw it up? -I did it to save you! What? No.
No way.
You didn't do this for me.
He was one step ahead of us.
If Klaus died, his hybrids would have killed you.
When are you going to get it through your head? Ohh! Stop saving me.
Don't do it, Jeremy.
Why not? You stab my back, I stab yours.
Why not? You stab my back, I stab yours.
I didn't stab you in the back.
Is that why you wanted to hang out, to get me off the vervain? Klaus asked me to.
I never thought he would try to kill you.
It's Klaus, Tyler.
What did you think was going to happen? He doesn't care about you.
All he wants is to get his family back.
What the hell! Whenever Klaus wants something, someone ends up dead.
You think about that next time before you blindly do whatever he says.
Jer, you should get home.
Stay inside.
Klaus isn't going to stop until he gets all those coffins back.
He's not done with you.
Ric.
Hey.
When did you return to the living? Oh, just a few minutes ago.
How's Jeremy? Hating me.
Hating life.
Hating the life that.
We can't even have a family dinner.
Without somebody dying before dessert.
Are you ok? Oh, my god.
Ugh.
Something's wrong.
The ring.
Ohh.
Ric.
Hey.
What happened? He got hit by a car, and he's coughing up blood.
Get his vitals.
Pulse thready and weak.
Looks like internal bleeding.
We got to get him out of here.
Let's move.
Let's not and say we did.
Why don't you two meet us at the hospital? What? No.
No, no, no.
Wait.
No, wait.
You have to help him.
What are you doing? You can still save his life, Elena.
Here.
Take my blood.
But I can't get in.
You're going to have to invite me.
No.
Why are you doing this? Klaus asked for his family.
You didn't deliver.
Ric! Oh, my god, Ric.
I'm right here.
Hey.
Hey, look.
I would invite me in, Elena.
Jeremy.
He's not dead yet.
Where are you going? What are you doing? Now he's dead.
We've got to get Alaric to the hospital, now.
You know what I can't figure out? Why save me? Was it brotherly love, guilty conscience, Is the switch on, is the switch off? Do you have somewhere you need to be, Damon? Ah, deflection.
That's not going to work on me.
I invented that.
We're done.
Can't you just go away? Not until you tell me why you saved me.
You owe me that.
I don't owe you anything.
Fine.
Next question, why did you steal the coffins? Because Klaus's family is one weakness I can use against him.
Use against him to do what? You're not going to kill him.
You know how I know this? 'Cause there was only one way to kill him, and you blew that to save me.
You're wrong, Damon.
Klaus doesn't get to just live forever.
There's another way.
There has to be.
Fair enough.
Whatever you're doing, I want in.
I don't need your help.
Really? Last time I checked, Really? Last time I checked, you were hiding out in a haunted house.
I'm in this alone, Damon.
You go after Klaus, you're going to have to be cutthroat and devious.
I'm so much better at that than you.
Come on, brother.
What do you say? If you're going to keep saving my life, at least make it for a good reason.
You want in, huh? Ok.
But it's just me and you.
-Elena stays out of it.
-Deal.
Follow me.
Wait.
I'm not so Welcome in there.
Don't you worry, Damon.
We all want the same thing.
Have a look.
What? Klaus is allergic to dust? Mmm.
Look again.
Witch spirits hate Klaus as much as we do.
They're using their powers to hide the coffins.
So if he comes in the house He won't be able to find them.
Mr.
Saltzman.
What are you doing up? You should be resting.
Mr.
Saltzman.
What are you doing up? You should be resting.
Uh, I'm more of a walk-it-off kind of guy.
Ahem.
Do I need to sign something? Internal hemorrhaging, 3 broken ribs, and a severe concussion.
I have no idea how you're on your feet right now, but I need to run some more tests.
Actually, I have someplace I need to be.
But thank you, Doctor Fell.
But the patience who follow my advice get to call me Meredith.
Well, I appreciate your help, Dr.
Fell.
Mr.
Saltzman What is your secret? Guardian angel, or did you sell your soul to the devil? Little of both.
Thank you for coming.
I trust you have news of Stefan.
I couldn't find him.
But I have something else.
My poor sister.
I can't turn my back on her for a moment.
You have Rebekah.
A deal is a deal.
The life of my sister in exchange for your brother? Yeah, I'd say that's a bargain.
Consider him spared.
You should know, I was the one that daggered her.
When she wakes, she'll come after me.
I can control Rebekah.
Besides, I still need your help finding Stefan.
I told you, I don't know where he is.
You're lying.
Fortunately, you have no shortage of loved ones.
If I don't find my family, the question you should be asking yourself is, who's going to die next? Bonnie? Caroline? who's going to die next? Bonnie Damon? It's only a matter of time before Stefan gives me what I want.
He doesn't care about me any more.
You made sure of that.
You turned him into a monster.
Now he's your problem.
And just so you know, I'm not the only one Rebekah wants dead.
She knows what you did to your mother.
She knows that you killed her.
You can let yourself out.
So the ring brought you back to life, but it didn't heal you.
Does that mean it's broken? I don't know.
It's never happened like that before.
I guess I have Damon's blood to thank.
For the fact that I'm still walking.
He said to say you owe him a drink.
That's funny.
I'd rather have head trauma.
Hey, Jeremy You ok? Why wouldn't I be? I shot a hybrid in the back and chopped his head off with a meat cleaver.
What You can talk to me about this stuff.
You know that, right? What could you tell me that I don't already know? This is the way things are.
It sucks, but I just got to get used to it.
Did you get rid of him? Yeah.
Tony the headless hybrid's.
now at the bottom of Steven's quarry.
What about Alaric? Took care of him, too.
He'll be fine.
How are you? I think I got most of the blood off the porch.
Elena.
Look at me.
It's going to be ok.
I have to tell you something.
I made a deal with Klaus.
I gave him Rebekah.
What? No, no.
No.
You did not do that.
She's going to come here and try and kill you.
No, she won't.
Klaus won't let her because he needs me.
And suddenly, you trust him? No, I don't trust him.
But what other choice do I have? I don't trust Stefan.
Do you think he's just going to give up the coffins? My brother's Sort of running his own show right now.
Yeah.
My brother just chopped off someone's head.
It's not right.
It's not fair.
He's 16 years old.
He shouldn't have to live like this.
Elena There has to be another way.
I have to fix it.
We will.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
We will.
Ok? Here we are, Rebekah.
Home, sweet home.
Only took 1,000 years.
And to think, I was counting on you being here with me.
But that's all ruined now, isn't it? I'm so sorry.
Sister.
We'll meet again one day.
Hey.
Can we talk? What did I do now? I've been thinking about what you said earlier, about how we should pack up and go.
Elena, I didn't mean any of that.
But you were right.
You shouldn't have to give up a normal life.
Just because of me.
What's going on? Your sister thinks we should have another one of our talks.
Here's the thing, Jeremy.
You're going to go out of town for a little while.
A long while.
You're going to stay with some nice family friends in Denver.
You're going to be in a new school and meet new girls Living girls.
You're going to drink a few beers, take an art class.
You can do whatever you want.
Tell him he's going to leave mystic falls behind and never think twice about it.
You're going to leave mystic falls behind and never think twice about it.
You're going to have a better life, Jeremy.
This is the one I dreamed of.
Don't bother.
It won't open.
What do you mean, is it locked? Nope.
It just won't open.
I've tried everything Blow torch, ax, crowbar.
I can't even scratch the finish.
That means it's closed with a spell.
You mean whatever's in there should probably stay in there.
You said you wanted to make him suffer.
The witches led me here for a reason.
I think whatever's inside this coffin is our answer.
I feel like a horrible person.
You just saved his life, Elena.
Take it from me Estranged is bad.
Dead is worse.
Just can't stop thinking about what happened.
The last time I asked you to compel him.
He found out, and he got over it.
Again, not dead, Elena.
He's so lucky to have you for a sister.
Thank you.
No problem.
Not just for this, Damon.
For everything.
I don't know what I would do if you weren't here.
You should know this, Elena.
Stefan didn't screw us over.
He screwed us over, but he had a good reason.
What? He saved Klaus to save me.
Then he stole the coffins to get even.
Damon, if he did it to protect you, then Why would he even do that? I mean Why would he even do that? I mean Oh, what does it even mean? What does it mean? It means I'm an idiot.
'Cause I thought for one second that I wouldn't have to feel guilty any more.
What are you talking about, guilty for what? For wanting what I want.
Damon No, I know.
Believe me, I get it.
My brother's girl and all.
No.
No.
You know what? If I'm going to feel guilty about something, I'm going to feel guilty about this.
Good night.
