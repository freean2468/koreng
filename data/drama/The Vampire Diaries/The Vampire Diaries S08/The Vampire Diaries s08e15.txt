Weâ€™re Planning a June Wedding



                    			1 Previously on The Vampire Diaries  Bet you didn't see that coming.  Go to hell.  You first.  SELINE: When the door between this world and Cade's  gets cracked open, it wipes out everything for miles.  In this case  All of us in Mystic Falls.  All you got to do is make sure  that bell rings 12 times.  I thought you had to figure things out.  I couldn't see that everything that I was looking for  was right here in you.  Will you marry me?  Yes, of course.  You didn't destroy hell.  Thanks to you killing Cade,  hell's never been in better hands.  If Cade's not running hell, who is?  The person who knows where all your weak spots are.  The one who wants revenge  for what we did to her.  Don't you dare say that name!  The baddest bitch of all.  Katherine.    MAN: Hey!  Are you part of my Uber pool?  Oh, my God, you're  [man screaming.]   Hey.  Hi.  I know we have a lot to talk about,  but I don't, I don't want to get into  any of that right now.  I don't want to talk about us or Enzo  or Stefan or anything,  except the trouble headed our way.  You are gonna need this.  So the victim was here until you closed.  Did he say where he was going?  If he was meeting up with anyone?  No.  - Give me a minute. - Okay.  - Dad, when did you get back? - Just this morning.  Hey, look, I would've called ahead,  but I wanted to tell you in person.  [door creaks open.]  Mom?  Hi, Matty.  Hey, I, uh, thought you were gonna  give me a minute with him first.  I saw you two talking.  I couldn't wait to see my son.  After waiting four years since your last phone message?  As I remember, I asked you to call me back.  Hey, look, look, I know it's sudden,  but you gave me a second chance.  Didn't turn out so bad, right?  I thought you hated him for leaving us.  That was a lifetime ago.  Things have changed since then.  I was I was actually glad to hear from him.  I was hoping we could all get dinner tonight.  [phone chimes.]  I'm not sure I'll be free.  All right, professor,  how do we get rid of the queen of hell?  Are you sure Katherine's in our world?  When Cade crossed planes after the 11th ring of the bell,  other souls could step through, too.  Same way Kai did.  Katherine would have jumped at that chance.  Then why haven't we seen her yet?  I thought by now she'd be  strutting around, making demands,  or trying to get us all killed.  Maybe she's biding her time.  Or putting her own plan together.  Either way, you're gonna need a new weapon.  Is that Dorian?  Yeah, I've asked Dorian to take point  on our research front.  This doesn't mean you and I are cool.  I still have those files on you, so  I'm here to hold you accountable  for the rest of your God-given life.  I hope that you do.  So what have you guys come up with?  Cade was killed with a dagger that was made from his bones.  It was fused into glass by a white-hot flame.  First things first, though,  I don't suppose you know where Katherine's bones are?  Oh, who'd have ever thought she'd have done us a favor?  We've got every last one of Katherine's bones  in the cave,  underneath the old church,  left over from a traveler barbecue  she had when she tried to possess Elena.  But fusing the bones into glass  How do we make that kind of weapon?  Would putting the bone in a metal dagger do the trick?  My parents are in town. I could ask my dad for help.  "Parents," plural?  Unexpected family reunion,  so now I've got two nightmares to deal with.  Gossip later, townies.  Stefan and I will go on bone-fetching duty.  Dorian and I will research an alternative to fight her.  See, if Katherine's back,  that means hell still exists.  We need to figure out a way to break her link to hell.  BONNIE: These psychic dimensions are tied to emotional trauma.  Cade created his when he was burned at the stake.  I created mine when I saw Enzo get murdered.  I'm just saying maybe there's a way  to destroy the dimension itself.  Destroying hell destroys her.  Great. You guys are on Hail Mary miracle duty,  so how do the rest of us get Katherine to show herself?  Easy.  She's obsessed with Stefan  and insanely jealous.  If she sees anyone making him happy,  she won't be able to control herself.  So she'll have no choice but to come out of hiding.  - Your point? - My point is  we shove Stefan's happiness in her face.  We throw the one party Katherine would never miss.  Who doesn't love a wedding?  Sure, Caroline, get married.  The day you've dreamt of your whole life,  just throw it together like some  shotgun Vegas wedding  to lure out and murder your nemesis,  all before the vows are over.  Yeah, it's happening fast.  I never got to explain to you why I said yes to Stefan.  I know why you said yes.  You want to spend your life with him,  in spite of everything.  I get it, but  I can't watch you marry him.  Can't watch him be happy.  And it's really hard for me to say  that I won't be there with you.  Because you know I would do anything for you.  I can't do that to myself.  I won't.  I understand.  I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry in ways  that I didn't even know existed.  I know that I am one step removed  from the reason that you lost Enzo.  So I am extremely grateful that you're even sitting here  being my friend right now.  Bonnie, I love you so much.  So much.  Please know that.  I do.  I know you do.  DAMON: How are those vows coming?  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that  Katherine won't let the ceremony get that far.  Caroline and Bonnie are probably already rehearsing.  You don't want to seem unprepared.  Look what happened to Enzo  is gonna haunt you  and her for the rest of your lives.  But the you standing with me right now,  the you that's gonna marry Caroline Forbes tomorrow,  the you that I have known for almost 200 years  You didn't do it.  Evil, nasty, Ripper Stefan did it.  And you are not him.  You hear me?  Yeah.  Good.  Did you know you can get ordained online?  DAMON: Did it this morning.  You are looking at a bona fide justice of the peace.  [Damon groans.]  Rise and shine, kitty cat.  Hi, I'm Katherine,  the bitch that will destroy your lives  for all eternity! [laughs.]  Uh, okay, why don't we just, uh, get what we need  and get out of here.  It's pretty fitting, though.  The woman that started this whole mess  is back to try and end it.  I wouldn't say it was all a mess.  What are you talking about?  Look at the path that she sent us down.  Ripper sprees, the Originals, the cure, Silas,  - the Other Side - I'm just saying that  Prison worlds, Gemini twins, Heretics,  and don't get me started on  doppelgangers! [laughs.]  I'm just saying we had some good things  happen to us, too, right?  That's very glass-half-full of you, brother.  Well, I have to think that way, otherwise I go  - to a very dark place. - All right, all right,  before this turns into a sob-fest.  Happy bachelor party, little brother.  Oh, you can celebrate with us, too.  [making chugging sounds.]  Sorry for the lack of exotic dancers you know,  short notice and all.  Oh, this place hasn't changed a bit.  There's my table.  Vicki used to fill my glass on the sly.  Why are you really here?  I've had a lot of time to think these last few years.  I stopped dwelling on the past.  I want to do things better now.  People do change, believe it or not.  I know this is a lot for you, Matty.  But I miss my family.  [sniffles, chuckles.]  Don't worry, I won't get all weepy  before the drinks arrive.  TRUDY: She told me not to post video, but screw her.  Everyone should know what a slut she is.  Uh, what is that?  It's disgusting, isn't it?  It's what happens when you get older and die,  come back from hell.  It's really rough on the body.  But there is a short-term remedy.  [screams.]      DAMON: All right, bulletin.  Human Stefan is a lightweight.  Damon.  - Oh, God. - This is not my fault, Caroline.  Impromptu weddings  call for impromptu bachelor parties.  [groans.]  Oh, please, don't be mad at me, Caroline.  I'm not mad at you.  Thank you for my present, by the way.  Looks like I am gonna need  a new drinking buddy.  Pass.  Oh, come on.  It's your last night as a single gal.  Let's blow this popsicle stand.  - [groans.] - No.  That is a $10,000 rug.  Psst.  [Stefan groaning.]  A love that's there   For others, too   I'm a fool to holdhoou   Perhaps you should consider a less melancholy playlist.  Helps me stay connected to you.  [exhales.]  You don't need pain to keep our connection alive.  You are a witch, after all.  A witch who can't do magic.  What do you call my presence, then?  Clearly, I'm not a hallucination.  There has to be magic involved;  therefore, you don't need pain.  Therefore, you can attend the wedding  without fear of losing your link to me.  That's not why I'm skipping the wedding.  Stefan murdered you.  That version of Stefan  died when you gave him the cure.  The real Stefan is back.  He's the one who's getting married tomorrow.  Maybe when I'm dead I'll be as evolved as you,  but that is not how I feel about him.  Then trust Caroline.  Trust how she feels.  Share in her happiness.  It won't negate ours.  Are you actually happy?  Certainly, luv.  I'm imagining us next to a little church I remember  in the French countryside.  It's in the middle of a lavender field.  I always thought it would be the perfect place to marry you.  And after our wedding, we'd dance.  And I'd tell you how much I love you.  And I'd tell you the absolute truth,  which is I'm the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.  All right. I got one more.  No. No more practice speeches.  - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - [groans.]  Okay, listen.  Come on, come on.  Up.  To a Mystic Falls mom  who started out by hating me,  and became one of my closest friends.  She was strong. She was loving.  And not only did she protect this town,  but she raised an incredible daughter  [lightly chuckles.]  that I now get to call family.  To Liz Forbes.  Gone but never forgotten.  God, I miss her.  I know.  I hate that she is not here.  [laughs dryly.]  And Bonnie's not coming, my girls can't be there,  Elena won't be there.  Hold that thought.  So, I remember when you gave me this  at Christmas.  You said it was for future me.  A guy who'd one day ask for your forgiveness.  Is this you asking?  Let's save that for another Salvatore bonding night,  - why don't we? - [chuckles.]  I just wanted you to know that Elena  would be with you tomorrow.  But just so we're clear  I want that back.  [laughs.]  Something borrowed.  Got it.  [sighs.]  [sighs.]  - There she is! - Mommy!  Oh! Ooh!  Oh, you girls look amazing.  Ooh.  But I thought we decided it wasn't safe.  ALARIC: Yeah, well, you and I  both know that Katherine would smell a rat  if they weren't there.  So Stefan called in a favor from Valerie.  It turns out she has a soft spot for Gemini twins.  She put a protection spell on them,  so they'll be safe no matter what.  Thank you for bringing them.  Daddy, come practice with us.  Oh, I'd love to, sweetheart,  but Daddy has to go back to work.  You understand, right?  Of course.  [giggles.]  - Ric - JOSIE: Can I wear this?  Uh, I'm pretty sure that's Mommy's.  That is my something new.  Do you want to help me put it on?  - Uh-huh. [giggles.] - Yeah.  [whispering.]: Ah, thank you.  [Caroline and Josie giggle.]  I also have something blue,  something old, and something borrowed.  [whispering.]: Mommy looks so pretty.  - [Josie giggles.] - Yes, yes, she does.  [sighs.]  Be happy, Caroline.  Uh yeah.  [girls giggling.]  Peter.  Didn't expect you to be so cleaned up.  [laughs.] Well, it is a wedding.  I thought you'd come straight  from your workshop with the dagger.  The one they asked you to make from Katherine's bones.  I'm surprised Matt told you about it.  I didn't think he'd want to involve you in all this.  Well, if we're gonna be a family again,  we need to be honest with each other.  Okay, then yes.  Yeah, I I finished in time to take a shower  so I could get here a little early.  And where's the dagger?  [sighs.]  I gave it to Stefan already.  [vomits.]  Hey, are you okay?  Honestly, no.  Maybe I should hold onto that.  No, I'm the bait. I should.  Hey.  Know this.  If she lays a hand on you,  I will cut her up into tiny, little pieces  and I will serve her at the wedding buffet.  Hope I get to see you have this one day with Elena.  A wedding, a human life  all of it.  I want you to be there, too, brother.  'Cause I'm gonna need a best man.  [chuckles softly.]  Hopefully your hero hair hasn't fallen out by then.  [exhales.]  [string quartet begins playing.]  Where's Dad?  I haven't seen him all day.  I'm sure he'll be here soon.  STEFAN: By the way, I think you may have gone  a little bit overboard with the number of compelled guests.  DAMON: Well, I mean, Stefan,  it had to look authentic.  Katherine knows your girl's not gonna have  a small, intimate gathering.  Ah.  Traditional opening waltz of the Founder's Ball.  The exact same one you and Katherine danced to in 1864.  She won't be able to resist.  CAROLINE: You girls will go in front of Mommy,  and then Mommy will just walk herself down the aisle,  and it will all be fine.  BONNIE: Or  I could walk with you.  Oh, my God.  You're here.  [crying.]: Oh  I have a selfish reason.  I want to be a part of your happiness.  [laughs.]  Always.  Mommy, are you ready?  Now I'm ready.  [giggles.]  My best friend's here.  [phone chimes.]    [inhales.]  [exhales.] Check this out. So I've been reading about  psychic energy manipulation. If we could create  a massive amount of energy that breaches  the psychic plane of hell,  we might be able to destroy it.  Kind of like how they blow out oil well fires  by creating an even bigger explosion.  Except our explosion would be made  of incredibly intense psychic energy.  Or, we-we don't have to talk.  What with your, your girl getting married today and all,  that's  You know what? You look like you need bourbon.  I should find some bourbon.  Did I ever tell you why I came to Mystic Falls?  I was hunting Damon.  He had killed my first wife.  Then I found out he had turned her,  and that was what she wanted.  Eventually, I got past that.  How?  I guess I didn't have the energy to hate somebody forever.  We've all made terrible mistakes in our lives.  Done things that  no apology can heal.  But you just have to keep going.  Try to find some new happiness.  No matter how much you've lost.  The strange thing is  losing those people is what brought us together.  It's how we found each other.  It's what made us  a family.        Where did you get that necklace?  You gave it to me.  No, I didn't. That's Katherine's.  Seems she accepted our invitation.  She snuck into our house?  She's a villain. What do you expect?  No, no, no. Keep it on.  We want her to see you wearing it.  You think she's already here?  Dad should've been here by now.  DAMON: Dearly beloved.  We are gathered here today  to witness the joining of these two epic lovebirds  in official matrimony.  Stefan has found the woman of his dreams,  and he's going to share the rest of his human life with her.  But before we begin,  if anyone has any objections to this union,  please speak now or forever hold your peace.  Yep.  Speak right now.  Anyone?  As in now.  Right now.  Well.  Well, it seems like no one's objecting,  so we will continue with the ceremony.  We will?  You betcha.  Do you, Stefan,  take this lovely woman  to be your lawfully wedded wife?  I do.  And do you, Caroline,  take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband,  to have and to hold, in sickness and in health,  till death do you part?  I do.  I believe the bride and groom have chosen  to write their own vows.  We haven't.  Oh. Well just wing it.  Go.  Caroline.  You have been my my friend,  my conscience,  my sounding board.  You saw light in me  when all I saw was darkness.  You saved me from despair.  You told me once that I would fall madly in love  without realizing it.  And that's what happened.  [laughs softly.]  Day by day,  bit by bit, year by year.  With you.  I remember saying that to you.  We were dancing at my prom.  It's funny the things we remember  out of all the years that go by.  I remember how you told me  that when I was ready for you, you would be ready for me.  I'm ready now.  I think a part of me  has been ready for this day since the moment  I first saw you,  the new mystery guy in the hallway at school.  [Caroline laughs softly.]  I will always remember this moment.  A hundred years from now,  I will remember this moment for the both of us.  Wow.  Munchkins.  Rings.  Now.  With this ring,  I thee wed.  [chuckles.]  With this ring,  I thee wed.  DAMON: With the power recently vested in me  by the Commonwealth of Virginia,  I now pronounce you husband and wife.  You may kiss the bride, little brother.    -  When our bodies fall apart  - [Josie and Elizabeth laughing.]  A broken puzzle of the past   Why send the necklace, but skip the wedding?  Maybe she wants to stand you up for old times' sake.  Hmm. So nice having you back, Bon.  Warms my cold dead heart.  'Cause honey, all the good things left   I will love you till the world   Stops turning   And ever after, when it comes   And all the days between, I left   For learning   What this life's about   So I'll love you till the world stops turning round   When your well is drying up   Like a desert into dust   [gas hisses.]  And there's no rain on the horizon   I'll be there to fill your cup   I will love you till the world stops turning   Come on. Bathroom's this way, ladies.  And ever after   Mom, where'd you go?  You can't just bail in the middle of a wedding.  [phone beeps.]  [line ringing.]  [phone ringing nearby.]  [ringing continues.]  [ringing continues.]  [crickets chirping.]  Dad. Dad!  Oh, you lost a lot of blood.  We're lucky Katherine didn't kill you.  Katherine didn't do this. I  DAMON: Paging the bride and groom.  Thank you.  It is now time for everyone's favorite best man  to make a little toast.  [smacks lips, inhales slowly.]  Little brother,  I have waited a hundred and  well, a whole lot of years,  to make this speech.  And today, I finally get to tell my little brother  I'll take it from here, gorgeous. [chuckles.]  He and I made out once.  [in raspy voice.]: Super hot.  Drunken toast from Kelly Donovan.  Perfect. Now it's a wedding.  Well, I've known Stefan Salvatore for years,  but I can honestly say  I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. [chuckles.]  And then,  there's little Mrs. Perfect. Aw.  - Too mad your mother's dead. - [guests gasp.]  Maybe if you hadn't tried to cure cancer,  she might have lived to see this.  Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.  That's enough. Hey.  Now go find the open bar.  No.  Damon.  You're worse than either of them.  What you did to Vicki? Shame on you.  She didn't hurt anyone ever. She might have  turned her life around, but you didn't give her the chance.  Then again,  I never had a chance, either.  No, this town made up its mind  about me [scoffs.] long time ago.  You all looked right through me for years.  Treated me like a joke.  Sent me packing without a second thought.  Maybe  if you hadn't forgotten all about me,  you would have known  that I had a bad fall two years ago.  And  you never knew I was dead.  No, the only one who gave a damn about me was Katherine.  She saw how I was  suffering in hel  Where is she?  [wretches.]  [guests gasp.]  I have no idea.  I was busy causing a gas leak in the house.  Oh, my God. The girls.  And Bonnie.  You really think you could play Katherine Pierce?  [laughs.]    [Bonnie, Josie and Elizabeth coughing.]  It's okay.  We're okay.  Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.  Okay?  ENZO: You have to keep moving, luv.  You'll die if you stay here.  I don't know how they're even doing this.  [girls coughing.]  Enzo?  I think they're siphoning directly from you.  But I don't have any magic.  Of course you do, luv. How else do you think  you've been able to stay connected to me?  [coughing continues.]  Let them siphon you, Bonnie.  Tell them to use the magic to save you.  - No. - Look,  I know that you think we'll be parted forever  if you let go of me now, but I believe the opposite.  Enzo.  I believe the opposite.  I believe we'll be together again.  When I see you again, there'll be only peace.  And no one will ever part us.  But right now,  you need to fight!  And you need to live.  Please, Bonnie.  Bonnie, you know in your heart this is right.  Do it now.  Use your magic.  Show them how to do the spell.  Do what I do, okay?  Say these words:  Phesmatos motus incendiaros.  Phesmatos  Live your life, Bonnie Bennett. All of it.  Promise me.  [girls chanting.]  I promise.  I love you.  I love you  Phesmatos  motus incendiaros.  Phesmatos  ALL: motus incendiaros.  Phesmatos motus incendiaros.  Phesmatos motus incendiaros.  Phesmatos motus  incendiaros.  [guests yell.]  [panicked murmuring.]  [coughs.]  - Mommy! - Oh, my God.  Oh  You're okay.  Oh, my babies. [sighs.]  You're okay.  What did Katherine promise you?  Nothing.  Then why help her?  You don't get it.  She promised me nothing  oblivion, emptiness.  Anything is better than endless torture in hell.  And all I had to do was keep you idiots distracted  until the fire started.  What is Katherine planning?  You don't have to bully me. She wanted me to let you know.  She's gonna burn down Mystic Falls.  With hellfire.  Tonight.  [chuckles.]  She's talking about the bell.  Even if Katherine rings the bell, she can't create hellfire.  Only someone from the Maxwell bloodline can do that.  Dad's not gonna do it and neither am I.  Oh, then it's a good thing you weren't an only child.  DAMON: Except Vicki's dead as a doornail.  KELLY: She was.  Until my son opened up a portal  to hell and let some people out.  - [thunder cracks.] - [laughs.]  ["Darlin'" by Goodbye June playing.]    [bell tolls.]  There's Vicki.  Right on time.  [gags, coughs.]  [gasps.]  Whoa, oh, oh   Oh, oh   [groans.]  Mom  Darlin', I don't know what you've done to me   But it works and I hate it   Works and I hate it   Whoa, oh, oh.
