I Was Feeling Epic



                    			1 Previously on The Vampire Diaries  When that bell rings 12 times,  the the hellfire it unleashes, wipes out everything for miles.  In this case  All of us in Mystic Falls.  I now pronounce you husband and wife.  You may kiss the bride, little brother.  We're okay.  Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.  I think they're siphoning directly from you.  But I don't have any magic.  Of course you do, luv.  If Cade's not running hell, who is?  The one who wants revenge for what we did to her.  Katherine.  See, if Katherine's back, that means hell still exists.  Maybe there's a way to destroy the dimension itself.  Destroying hell destroys her.  She's gonna burn down Mystic Falls.  With hellfire.  Even if Katherine rings the bell, she can't create hellfire.  Only someone from the Maxwell bloodline can do that.  Dad's not gonna do it and neither am I.  Oh, then it's a good thing you weren't an only child.  DAMON: Except Vicki's dead.  KELLY: She was.  Until my son opened up a portal to hell.  [Stefan grunting.] Bonnie  What happened?  The magic was too much for her.  - [grunts.] - Here.  Bonnie?  Hey. No, no, no, no, no.  - Oh, my God. - No. Don't do this.  Bonnie.  Come on, Bonnie.    Bonnie?  Elena.  - Elena! - Hi!  Hi!  [laughs.]  I never thought I'd see you again.  No.  No, wait.  This isn't how it's supposed to be.  No. You can't die.  Not yet.  You have to live and, and grow old and have children,  - and grandchildren. - I'm okay.  I can be with Enzo now.  - No, this is wrong. - Elena.  I'm ready.  Well, I'm not.  Enzo.  Sorry, luv, but it's not your time.  [gasps.]  - [crying.] - Hey.  [exhales.]  I saw her.  I saw Elena.   [clicking, whirring.]  [bell tolls.]  Sorry. Can't let you do that.  I'm sorry. But there's nothing you can do to stop me.  [yelling.]  [splatters.]  [people gasping, screaming.]  Where is she?  She went splat.  You threw her out the window?  You are aware that she's already dead.  Damon!  Don't "Damon" me.  In fact, don't say anything at all.  Katherine Pierce just declared war,  and I need a clear head.  Was that really necessary?  Vicki.  You're a dick.  You can't stop me. This is my ticket out of hell,  and I'm taking it.  Katherine is gonna save  - [bones crunch.] - Damon!  Relax. Just testing a theory.  Wait for it  - [bones crunching.] - [moaning.]  Yep, she's deader than a doornail.  And I'll just keep coming back, again and again.  You need to convince her to stop ringing this bell.  You understand me?  Fate of Mystic Falls lies with you  - and your family, so get on it. - And where are you going?  Anticipating your failure, so it's kind of dumb  to stick around.  I have things to do.  I can't believe you're here.  I can't do the emotional reunion, Matt.  I love you, and I'm sorry,  but Katherine told me to ring this bell  every five minutes until Mystic Falls burns.  You should save yourself, that's what I'm doing.  Vick, this is our home.  This is your home.  This town means nothing to me.  You're gonna believe Katherine Pierce?  She's a liar!  I can't go back there.  You don't know what it's like.  At least this way,  when I die, I'll just be dead. Gone.  And I'm okay with that.  [whirring.]  [bell tolls.]  STEFAN: There has to be something.  The only chance we've got is if Donovan can somehow  convince his train wreck of a sister  hell ain't so bad.  There he is. Matt!  Yeah, it's Sheriff Donovan.  Activate the evacuation protocol.  Gas leak.  Yeah, again.  There's got to be something we're missing.  Nope. Katherine won.  She played the long game and finally beat us.  What?  Earlier, Bonnie's heart stopped.  She said she saw Elena.  ELENA: Damon?  Elena.  What's going on?  Is Bonnie  Bonnie's okay.  You're both okay.  [laughs.]  I'm awake?  You're awake.  - [grunts.] - No.  No, no, no, no.  Rude.  You got to be kidding me.  Katherine.  Hello, brothers.  Am I drinking alone?  Where's Elena?  Dead.  A spiritual coma, if we're getting technical.  Her physical body. Where is it?  That's for me to know, and for you to dot, dot, dot.  I hope you enjoyed the little show  I put on for you.  It's been a hoot watching you take on the devil.  [chuckles.] Especially considering  I've had him wrapped around my finger  since the minute I stepped into hell.  Why did you think he wanted you?  Because I wanted you.  Duh.  Damn it, Katherine.  Where is she?  It really is the perfect revenge.  At 10:00 p.m., Mystic Falls will burn,  precious Elena will burn  and I'm guessing one of you two Salvatores  are going down with her.  Should I place my bets now?  Well, that shut her up.  [clock ticking.]  We're running out of time. We have to find Elena.  Let's go.  Where's my granddaughter? Where's Tiki?  - Dad! - Matt! I heard the bell.  And then when they said we had to evacuate  I need you to get in a van  so they can transport you to Grove Hill.  Wait, but if you're not the one ringing the bell, then  then what's the problem?  It's Vicki, Dad.  What?  STEFAN [over phone.]: She's not in the house.  Damon's checking the grounds and the cemetery.  Have you tried the high school?  That's my next stop.  Okay, I'll meet you there.  Okay. Bonnie's in the car with the girls.  I grabbed the baby books.  Do we need anything else?  Everything else is replaceable. Let's go.  Listen, I need you to go ahead.  I'm gonna stay here and help Stefan.  Help Stefan do what?  Katherine has taken Elena's body,  so I'm going to help them find it.  No. No, Caroline.  You know Damon won't leave this town without her.  Well, that is not your problem.  It's Elena, Ric, and they need me.  - Your girls need you. - They have you.  Okay? Just  Come on. Get them to the Armory, I'll meet you there.  - I promise. - No.  I don't need to remind you what it's like to lose your mother.  Don't make me have to tell those girls you died  because you put somebody else before them.  You won't have to.  I'll get out of here safely.  I promise.  Come on, let's get you out of here.  [grunts.] Come on.  No.  [thuds.]  No, no, no.  [exhales.]  Damn it.  [bell tolls.]  OFFICER: Come on, keep it moving!  This way, this way.  The boiler room? There is a horror movie reference  in there somewhere, but it escapes me.  I'm fine, but she's trapped.  We're running out of time.  You have to get Katherine to break the spell.  I'm all over it.  Need something?  You're like a bad penny.  Funny thing about that bone dagger,  it sends me to hell, but it can't keep me there.  I'm sorry.  Oh, and if you want to know  how to get Elena free, you can't.  Kai Parker was kind enough to set that trap for me,  and, if I'm not mistaken,  he's forever indisposed.  After 153 odd years,  this banter that we have is just old.  So, why don't we just skip to the part  where you tell me what you want and we'll negotiate.  I have everything I want, Damon, or I'm about to.  Once that last bell rings,  this stupid town will go up in flames  and everybody will go poof.  Well, they'll  burn alive first,  but then their ashes will go poof.  You know, petty doesn't look good  on a woman your age, Katherine.  Oh, I'm not being petty. I'm gloating.  No, you're jealous of Elena.  Because you know that Stefan and I both  would choose her over you every time.  And she would choose Stefan.  What makes you so sure of that?  Because I would.  Any woman would.  Stefan is the better man.  [chokes.]  [chuckles.]  CAROLINE: Kai spelled her in. She can't get out.  We're too far away.  Can't get back in time to help.  What are we supposed to do?  I can't leave Elena here.  It's not just Elena.  BONNIE: What do you mean?  You know Damon won't leave her here to die alone.  You need to head out now, Caroline.  Take the tunnels.  It'll be faster for you.  [phone beeps.]  I can't believe this is happening.  I need to talk to Damon.  Do you think you'll convince him?  No.  But I have to try.  I made a promise to Ric  that I wouldn't risk the girls growing up without a mother.  So I can help you  - with Damon, but I can't - No.  I can do it alone.  You get to safety.  Family first.  We're family now. Okay?  You and me and the girls. It's just please, please,  [crying.]: don't make me leave you. Please.  If I want to convince Damon I have to move fast,  and I can't do that unless I know you're safe.  [crying.]: No.  He's my brother.  [cries.]  Family first.  I love you so much.  I love you, too.  [sighs.]  All right, girls, why don't you go change your dresses, okay?  BONNIE: You okay?  It's not that I don't care, you know.  I care about Elena.  It's okay, Ric. I understand.  And I care about Damon.  He knows you do.  I don't want to fail them,  but I can't fail my daughters.  And they need their mother.  Ric, if there was something we could do we would do it.  What is this?  ALARIC: That is Project Hail-Mary.  Dorian and I were trying to find a way to destroy Cade's hell.  We figured we needed  a few million volts of mystical energy,  just give or take.  [sighs.] It kind of took the wind out of our sails.  Like the kind of energy contained in hellfire?  [cell phone rings.]  Bonnie, is everything okay?  Listen, Stefan, I know I've been hard on you.  But I also know that you and I are equally willing  to do anything we can to fix this.  Absolutely.  Why? Do you have something?  BONNIE: I think I do,  but the only way it gets rid of Katherine Pierce  is if she's in hell when I destroy it.  That's where it gets tricky.  Tell me what I need to do.  MATT: All right, guys, keep it moving.  Everybody out.  [car horns beeping, sirens wailing.]  I need to thank you for what you did earlier tonight in the fire.  We saved you. Yeah.  You did.  And not just that,  you made me realize that I had all the magic  I ever needed right inside me.  Now give me a little luck.  Right here.  I made it, as promised.  Any word from Stefan?  Listen, we have to leave quickly.  I'll explain everything to you in the car, okay?  Come on, girls, let's go.  Run to the car. Run to the car.  I'm gonna save the world.  And you need to get in that car and drive away.  But I don't Bonnie  ALARIC: Caroline. I'm so sorry,  but we really have to go.  BONNIE: Ric will fill you in.  I love you.  Just don't do anything stupid, Bonnie Bennett.  I'll be fine.  Promise.  Taking a trip down memory lane?  Oh, I've missed this place  said no one ever.  I figured you'd keep showing up to annoy me.  You're nothing if not utterly predictable.  And miss a minute of the Elena Gilbert show?  Speaking of which, shouldn't you be by her side?  Well, I figure now that you're practically the devil,  you'd be in the know.  I just hung up with Bonnie Bennett,  and she figured out a way to save the day.  Bonnie isn't strong enough to save a kitten.  She's done it once or twice, and my money's on her.  We're talking about hellfire.  So intense, it could obliterate  anything within miles.  What the hell is Bonnie gonna do?  She's 30 minutes away.  If you take the highway around the mountain,  sure.  But as the crow flies,  it's only seven miles  which is the beauty of these tunnels.  Did you know that they go  from the Armory straight into the heart  of downtown Mystic Falls?  Man, I bet you didn't know that, did you?  You think Bonnie Bennett can magically draw hellfire  through the tunnels away from the town?  Even better.  I think she can send it straight back to hell,  where you and I will be waiting patiently for it.  I got to say,  I look forward to dying by your side, KP.  You're bluffing.  No, he's not and neither am I.  I got this handled, bro.  You need to get out of these tunnels.  I'm not the one who's gonna get out of here, Damon.  You are.  Bad time to be a martyr, Stefan.  Said the martyr.  I'm gonna let you two figure this out amongst yourselves.  [groans.]  Fine. Then we'll both go.  Somebody needs to stay here to make sure  she's actually in hell when it's destroyed.  I'm aware, Stefan.  Tell Elena that I did this for her,  to pay for my past mistakes.  You can tell her yourself.  I need to do this, Damon.  I owe it to Bonnie and Enzo.  I owe it to a lot of people.  I'm not gonna leave you to die here, Stefan.  Yes, you are.  Are you seriously gonna sit here and argue with me  about who needs this redemption more?!  You're not responsible for Enzo, Stefan!  You keep saying that, but you're wrong.  We're all responsible for our own actions.  Every drop of blood that I've spilled, I am accountable for.  Then I'm accountable, too, and I've spilled even more.  Damon, I'm human.  In 60 years, I'm gonna be old, I'm gonna be dead.  You have quite literally an eternity  with Elena ahead of you.  Which means a lot less without you.  Do you think I want this?  I just got married.  My wife is out there,  waiting for me to come home to her.  But in the nearly two centuries  since I made you become a vampire,  I have fought to turn you into the man  who deserves the happiness that's out there right now.  No.  Just let me do this for you.  No.  Then let me do this for me.  Please.  I love you, little brother.  I love you, too.  And you're right.  You are human  which is why I can do this.  Go.  No, Damon, don't  You're gonna walk out of these tunnels,  and you are not gonna stop  until my death breaks the compulsion  because I am the big brother.  I'm sorry I wasn't better at it until now.  I said go. Go!  [bell chimes.]  Vicki?  Daddy.  Hi, honey.  Is this Matt's trump card?  Well, it won't work.  You're about 15 years too late to be paternal.  I'm not here to talk you out of it.  Oh, well, that's rich.  What, did you come to watch me  blow myself into oblivion?  Vicki, Bonnie has a plan.  I am not gonna stop ringing this bell.  We don't need you to stop.  Well, then what are you doing here?  I just wanted to see my daughter one last time.  Tell me what's going on.  I don't know what to say, Caroline.  Stefan, he's  he's made a decision.  Okay, Grams,  if I ever needed you to hear me,  hear me now.  Phesmatos incendia movet,  phesmatos incendia moventur.  - Ego ex vos. Vos ex unos. - [wind blowing.]  - Phesmatos incendia entrare. - [siren wailing.]  Phesmatos incendia movet  [rumbling, glass shatters.]  phesmatos incendia moventur.  Ego ex vos. Vos ex unos.  [sobbing.]  Stop the car.  I said stop!  [tires screech.]  [line ringing.]  STEFAN [taped message.]: Hey, it's Stefan.  Leave a message.  Stefan, please call me.  Please.  I need you to know that I understand.  I love you.  I will love you forever.  I understand.  [wind blowing.]  [bell clangs.]  phesmatos incendia moventur.  Ego ex vos. Vos ex unos.  BONNIE: Phesmatos incendia entrare.  Phesmatos incendia movet,  phesmatos incendia moventur.  Ego ex vos. Vos ex unos.  Phesmatos incendia entrare.  [gasps, panting.]  Poof.  BONNIE [voice echoing.]: phesmatos incendia moventur.  Ego ex vos. Vos ex unos.  Phesmatos incendia entrare.  Phesmatos incendia movet,  phesmatos incendia moventur.  Ego ex vos. Vos ex unos.  Phesmatos incendia entrare.  Phesmatos incendia entrare!  [fire roaring.]  No, no I can do this.  I can do this!  I can beat you.  You can't have me.  It's not my time!  Now you're finally ready to live.  Hi.  Keep fighting, love.  It's too strong.  - I can't do it alone. - Nonsense.  You are strong enough to do anything you put your mind to.  And, love  you're not alone.  Grams.  BOTH: Phesmatos incendia movet,  phesmatos incendia moventur.  Phesmatos incendia movet,  phesmatos incendia moventur.  Phesmatos incendia movet,  phesmatos incendia moventur.  Phesmatos incendia movet,  phesmatos incendia moventur.  Phesmatos incendia movet,  phesmatos incendia moventur!  [silence.]  I did it.  [school bell echoes.]  [voices from the past overlap and echo.]  GIRL: six, seven, eight.  [cheerleaders chanting.]  CAROLINE: I can't believe it. We are all here together.  BONNIE: It's our last hurrah before you guys go off to college.  CAROLINE: Before we go off to college.  STEFAN: Uh, pardon me, is this the men's room?  ELENA: Yes, um, it's a long story.  Hi.  Hi.  What happened?  Why am I here right now?  I don't know about Bonnie,  but Damon  Damon wanted  to sacrifice everything  to save you, to save this town.  He was ready.  I'm human now.  He compelled me to leave.  DAMON: Go.  But he should have known better.  I would never walk again  on this earth as a human without taking vervain.  [grunts.]  I don't understand.  Not long now, demon spawn.  I can hear that fire coming back this way.  You love this, don't you?  You have no idea.  [grunts.]  I gave him my blood.  The cure.  You what?  STEFAN: Without the cure, I'd start to age.  I'd be dead soon enough.  So Damon's okay?  - He's okay. - [sobs.]  But you, you're  I did what I had to do.  No! No  Stefan, please  [fire roaring.]  Burn in hell.  Good-bye, brother.  No, Stefan.  Tonight I saw a side of Damon that I hadn't seen in a while.  The older brother I looked up to.  The son who enlisted in the Civil War  to please his father.  The Damon I knew when I was a boy.  I wanted that Damon to live.  And I wanted you to have  an opportunity to get to know him.  He's the better man.  He's the right man.  It's good to see you, Elena.  One last time.  [exhales.]  There's something I have to say.  [Stefan whispering indistinctly.]  Mm-hmm.    Some things we don't talk about   Rather   LEXI: Well,  that was beautiful.  Just hold a smile   I was feeling epic.  -  Don't let me go  - [laughing.]  Don't let   Me go   -  Don't let me go  - [Lexi giggles.]  Don't let me go   BONNIE: Phesmatos incendia  ELENA: Dear Diary,  today will be different.  Today I will smile.  It will be genuine.  Because today is the day  that I get to live again.  There she is.  Am I  I did it.  [chuckles.]  I broke the spell.  How?  It took some time,  but I think I've finally figured this witch thing out.  [both laugh.]  Where is he?  He's with Caroline.  Saying good-bye.    ELENA: This life will be good  and beautiful.  But not without heartbreak.  In death comes peace.  But pain is the cost of living.  Like love, it's how we know we're alive.  Loving and fighting   Accusing, uniting   I can't imagine a world   Do you think it exists?  Peace?  Mm-hmm.  I do.  We'll see him again.  DAMON: You'll see him again.  Me, I'm going the other way.  They'll probably reopen hell for me.  Don't be so sure.  Hmm.  Come back, I still need you   Let me take your hand   I'll make it right   I'll swear to love you all my life   Hold on   I still need you   They took you away on a table   I pace back and forth   [Caroline and Elena chuckle.]  Pull you in to feel your heartbeat   Can you hear me screaming "Please don't leave me?"   Hold on   I still want you   Come back, I still need you   ELENA: I need you to know.  Stefan said something to me before we parted.  STEFAN: One day, when you wake up,  tell Caroline  I heard her.  And I will love her forever, too.  Mm-hmm.  He got my message.  Yeah, I just wanna   - [laughs.] -  Take you home   Hold on, I still want you   Come back   I still need you.     ELENA: And life goes on.  MATT: Dear Diary  we survived that night.  Mystic Falls is safe.  I remained the sheriff.  They even gave me a bench.  Thinking of running for mayor.  And Vicki, well,  I think she found peace.  Somehow, it feels like she did.  See the pain   In your eyes   BONNIE: I'm determined to keep my promise to Enzo,  I'm gonna live this life to the fullest.  I want to see the world.  Enjoy my life.  Do I have everything?  ENZO: Passport.  Passport. Nightstand.  Been through   You should've known   I wish it was me, not you   And just   Say the word   We'll take on the world   And just say you're hurt   ALARIC: And as for my family, Caroline and I  got what Damon decided  was Stefan's last wish.  BOTH: Daddy!  Nobody knows you   The way that I know you   Look in my eyes   I will never desert you   And just say the word   [girls giggling.]  CAROLINE: Opening the school was hard work.  We needed lots of help.  Fortunately, we knew plenty of people with experience.  Here you go.  We'll face the worst   Let's go.  Nobody knows you   - Hey, these are for you. - Thank you.  ALARIC: Caroline was determined to make it a success.  She wanted to make her mom proud.  And just say the word   We'll take on the world   And it's the fight   And the fight of our lives   You and I   We were made to thrive   ALARIC: Plus, soon after the school opened,  she got a most impressive donor.  But that is the beginning of another story.  Never forget we were built to last   ELENA: After med school, I came home to Mystic Falls.  It felt right.  It's where I wanted to grow old, and  I did.  And that's my life.  Weird, messy, complicated, sad,  wonderful, amazing and above all, epic.  And I owe it all to Stefan.  When I met him, I had lost my parents  and I was dead inside.  But he brought me back to life.  And I'm going to live it as best I can,  for as long as I can.  -  Nobody knows you  - [wings flap.]  The way that I know you   Look in my eyes   - [crow caws and flies off.] -  I will never desert you   And just say the word   We'll take on the world   We'll take on the   World   -  Hey, hey, hey  -  Oh, oh, oh   -  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  -  Hey   And nobody knows you   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh   The way that I know you   ELENA: Even after our long and happy life together,  Damon is worried he'll never see Stefan again,  that he'll never find peace.  But I know he's wrong.  Because peace exists.  It lives in everything we hold dear.  Our world, we'll go   With you by my side   The calm, the storm   Mom?  We'll face it all   And just say the word   That is the promise of peace.  That one day, after a long life,  we find each other again.  And nobody knows you   The way that I know you   Look in my eyes   I will never desert you   And just say the word   Just say the, just say the word   We'll take on the world   We'll take on the world.   Damon.  Hello, brother.
