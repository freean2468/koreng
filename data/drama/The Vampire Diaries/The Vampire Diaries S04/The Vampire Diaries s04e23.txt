Graduation



                    			 Previously on The Vampire Diaries: Silas wants to drop the veil between our side and the Other Side. He will open the floodgates for every supernatural being that has died. Done. The veil is down. - Hey. - Ah. - Who the hell was that? - That is my ex-boyfriend, Alexander. We should get out of here. - We should. - Too bad you can't. - Silas. - I can make you see whatever I want you to see. You have no idea who I am. - I will make your body turn to stone. - Isn't she your girlfriend? Who knows? She was sired to me. Her emotions were off. - What am I supposed to do with this? - Get the girl. I can bring Jeremy back. I can keep him here. No, you can't. Oh, my God. I'm dead. Welcome back. It was our deaths that allowed this day to come to pass. Massacres performed in the name of resurrecting the immortal Silas. Twelve hybrids. Twelve witches. The slaughter of innocents by the so-called hero protectors of Mystic Falls. They risked unleashing hell on Earth for their own selfish gains. And today that's exactly what they're going to get. Damon. Help me celebrate my 17th high school graduation. Hey, you remember my friend, Lexi, of course. Lexi. Back from the dead. Goodie. What's up, buzzkill? Stefan, just gonna sit there and let her enact her ghostly revenge? - You reap what you sow, buddy. - Let's be very clear. Whatever time I have left here, I sure as hell don't plan on wasting on you. - Got me? - Yeah, got you. So if you and Ric and little Gilbert are all flesh-like and real-seeming something went wrong when Bonnie tried to put that veil up. And here you two are having Dance Party USA. You're right. How selfish of me to be indulging in these precious moments with my formerly dead best friend. I should be sacrificing my own happiness for the good of others, right? I should be upstairs grooming my hero hair. - Are you drunk? - I don't know, Mom. Am I? Okay. Well, I guess that's one way to celebrate our supernatural apocalypse. Now, care to hazard any guesses on what the hell went wrong? - I hit kind of a snag. - A snag? A snag is a bad yearbook picture. You hit a tsunami. Where are you? Trying to fix it. I'm running into trouble. Need to wait until the full moon tonight to have power to put the veil up. Are you telling me that we might graduate in the middle of a ghost-filled Expression Triangle? - Maybe we should just cancel. - No, we are not going to cancel. Graduation is the most important event of our lives. The last ceremony of our youth. It is our rite of freaking passage. Hell will freeze over before I let anyone cancel graduation. Can you not make jokes about hell freezing over? We're not far off from that already. Just promise me that today is a friend day. Okay. I promise. I love you. I love you too. Go. I'll make sure no one finds your body. - But Bonnie - I know. Okay, I know I need to tell them. I just can't. - They've been through too much already. - I know, child. I was just going to say that make sure you say your goodbyes. Oh, my God. - No grease on the Other Side, huh? - You have no idea how much I miss this. And this. No. Hey. Hey. She just got her humanity back. Let her live a little. - You wish. - I'm dead. What are they gonna do? - Throw me in juvie? - At least you'd have a place to live. You both suck. Hey. Oh, there it is. That smile. I wasn't sure we were gonna see that again. I did some pretty terrible things. Hey, no. No tears. If Caroline was right, we only have until tonight. We need a no-crying rule. Crying's good. It means that I'm finally feeling something. And right now, I I feel happy. It's the Grill. Must be Matt. Hey, you went AWOL this morning. What happened? Hello, Elena. It's your old dead friend Connor. Remember me? A hidden compartment filled with advanced weaponry. Man has evolved from his days of throwing stones. There is nothing we can do for you. - Please, let us go. - I'm not holding you here. Although, I have a feeling that exploding contraption will have a hard time parting with your handsome friend intact. - Just go, Rebekah. I'll be fine. - I'm not leaving you. The soldier Connor found a way to siphon venom from a werewolf. - What do you want from us? - To fulfill my destiny. The brotherhood of hunters was created for one reason, and one reason alone. Vaughn. - Ugh! - Got a little message for you, laddie. Straight from the mouth of the witch Qetsiyah. We want Silas and we want the cure. I don't know where they are. I can't help you. Huh. Know who's gonna need some help? Grandma and Grandpa Jones in town for the big high-school graduation. Along with Auntie Sue and Uncle Mark and in fact everybody here at the Mystic Grill for graduation brunch. You either get me what I want, or they die. Yeah. Borrowed it from a jarhead friend Connor. - Shoots wood like lead. - Come on, man. I didn't kill you. You left me in that well on that island where I starved. There I was, alone on the Other Side, till Qetsiyah found me and reminded me of my supernatural destiny. Cure Silas and then kill Silas. End of story. Please don't hurt anyone. I'll find Silas and I'll get the cure. Good. Get it done. So you get off on terrorizing innocent people? - Who might you be? - The guy responsible for the 18-year-old you just threatened. - That 18-year-old snapped my neck. I'm also the guy who showed her how to do that. Ha, ha. That's ironic. You must not know a thing about fighting if you're trying to intimidate a dead guy packing C-4. This is my bar, pal. Nobody's gonna blow it up. Go ahead, sweet Rebekah. Use your vampire powers to whisk him away. I'm sure you can survive the blast of six of these automobiles, but can he? Just ignore him. All right? Just think about something else. Like graduation. What are your plans? College? Travel? Just because I'm never getting out of this town doesn't mean you shouldn't see the world. It's just been settled. I'm gonna show you life as you've only dreamt it. We'll start in Italy. There's a lovely little church outside San Vittore in Brienno. Romantic spot. Popular for weddings. Then I'll show you the northern lights in springtime. The Simatai gorge from atop the Great Wall of China. Every inch of the Louvre. China, Paris, northern lights it's a date. We'll see it all when we're done here, because we can. We're alive. We're not gonna be stuck as ghosts in misery on the Other Side. All right, you're done now. I got you. I don't think red's really your color, Bon-Bon. I was hoping the ghost of anyone would've killed you already. Funny you should mention death. I'm here to collect that immortality you promised. Funny you think you're going to get it. Qetsiyah's the only witch who knows the spell. - She was a no-show. You're out of luck. - See, here's the thing. I can't disagree with you, because I have been feeling out of luck lately. But you know who has been getting all of my luck? My beloved doppelgÃ¤nger, Elena. My shadow self is living a better life than I am so if I don't get that immortality, I may just have to get rid of her altogether. Did you just threaten my best friend? I can crush your skull without even flinching. Go ahead. Make your move. - Hey. - Hey. So I think there's some stuff that you and I need to talk about. Yes, we do. But first Consider it a graduation present. - Damon, I can't take that. - Sure you can. Looks like it might be cherry-flavored. I'm not saying that I don't want it, obviously I want it but that's the only one. There's only one cure. And the hunters have made it pretty clear they're willing to kill everyone in Mystic Falls until they get it. Elena, take the damn thing. I want you to take it. I can't. Well, I guess that answers the sire-bond question. You gonna help a brother out or you just gonna lurk? Look, Elena you're my sister and I love you no matter what you choose. How is it even when you're dead you're the bane of my existence? So the veil's down until tonight, he dies, goes to the Other Side and what, comes back all over again? How long does that take? What, they don't give you a rule book over there? You know, you're missing your chance to weigh in on the great Elena Gilbert cure debate. What am I supposed to do? Tell her it's her choice? Because that worked out so well. You know, it's funny. Those two are in there arguing about how to, uh, protect the world and they have yet to address their biggest issue. Enlighten me. The sire bond's gone. Elena's emotions are back. She finally knows exactly how she feels. And what if whatever she feels is for you? She's the love of my life. I'd go back to her in a heartbeat. But if that's not how she feels then maybe that's exactly what I need to hear to get my ass out the door. Maybe I will move to Australia. I can live in a yurt. Ha, ha. Cheers to that. Come on, we don't need the cure for Silas. He's a calcified statue. Unh. - What was that? - Nothing. Take off your shirt. Elena, there are children present. - Fine. - Ugh. Damon, why hasn't this healed? Because the bullet was laced with werewolf venom, okay? Hunters are dicks. - We need Klaus. We need his blood. - Klaus would rather see me die. Plus, Klaus is a thousand miles away, sipping a hurricane on Bourbon Street. That wound will kill you. What about the cure? Jeremy's right. If you're human, the werewolf venom won't hurt you. And here I was so moved by your speech to save mankind. Sounds like Vaughn's awake. Damon, wait. Here. - What the hell you doing? - Digging up Silas. Coming, Vaughn, or not? Here we are. - What is that? - It's where I dumped Silas. Closed off to hikers, no food for animals, endlessly deep water. I'm not following you. Where exactly did you put the body? Well, um Well, let me see. So I dragged his stone ass through here I flung him in that general direction and he tumbled down into those weeds. I kind of lost him in the rocks. What do you know about physics? What is it? It's distance equals velocity times time? Guess I should've told you to bring some scuba gear, huh? Don't you two look cozy. So he seems nice. Don't make jokes. I'll laugh and you'll fall. I'm wearing the Gilbert ring. I can't be killed by anything supernatural. Maybe if you're the one who detonates the bomb, I won't die. Absolutely not. You'll blow into a billion pieces, the ring with it. There's only one way to find out. Fine. Okay. The first rule of truly living do the thing you're most afraid of. What are you doing? I can't be killed, and you can't miss graduation. - Please, go. - No. Run. - What have you done? - I finally chose one of the good ones. We have to do something. If those hunters give the cure to Silas They're not giving it to Silas. Wherever Damon's taking Vaughn, it's a stall. Because Damon hasn't had time to bury Silas' body yet. - And that's all you need to know right now. - Okay, fine. We're stalling the hunters. But Damon is still dying. It was one bullet, and it was only laced. We still have time. I will go to New Orleans and I will beg Klaus if I have to. Then it's settled. You're going to your graduation. Gradua? No, Jer. I never even sent in my college applications. I don't care. Mom and Dad would kill you if there wasn't a photo of you in your getup. Jer, no, not if you can't be there. Lexi will keep me company. You're going. Let's go graduate. Klaus, now is not the time to decide that you are over me. I'm gonna call you every 10 minutes until you get your ass here to save Damon's life. - Where is everyone? - I'm here. Where have you been? You know, making plans for the summer, dodging death by vampire hunter. Where's Elena? We can't do this without her. I'm here. Thank you for today. I can't believe it. We're actually all here. We are all here together. - Bonnie Bennett, are you crying? - It's our last hurrah before you go to college. Before we go off to college. I kind of sort of missed the deadline, you know, being an emotionless bitch. The perks of being a vampire, we can go wherever we wanna go. We can choose our own roommates. We could get a triple room. I'm happy we're all here. Aw, group hug. Ah, I don't I don't hug. Get over yourself. Welcome parents, family and friends. What a beautiful day for graduation. Thank you for joining us today on this special day as we celebrate our graduates. So let's get started. John Albrick. David Bass. Sarah Beasley. Not to play favorites, but I'm especially proud of this next graduate. My lovely daughter, Bonnie Bennett. Congratulations. I'm so proud of you, sweetheart. Thanks, Dad. You're welcome. For everything. Savannah Davis. Matt Donovan. William Duncan. Caroline Forbes. Thank you. Matt Freeman. Elena Gilbert. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Greetings, little witch. - Jeff Gillies. - I thought Stefan got rid of you. - He did. And I spent the night clawing out of a cement grave. Tony Griffin. Isn't that the witch your friend Caroline killed? And over there, that's my hybrid friend Adrian. Also dead. In fact, these seats are scattered with two dozen supernatural faces all of whom have reason to lash out since their lives were sacrificed in order to make your Expression Triangle. - All they're waiting on is word from me. - The veil goes back up tonight. Don't you have anything better to do than harass me and my friends? Well, that's the thing. I don't want the veil to go back up. In fact, I want you to drop it completely so I and my fallen friends can live, Bonnie. It's time to pay the piper. The Kol I remember was adamantly against hell on Earth. I was. Till I was in hell. Now I would very much like to be back on Earth. - What's this? - It's me. I died last night. I'm a ghost. And I want the same thing you want. I don't wanna be on the Other Side with unfinished business. I want my parents to see me off to college. I wanna decorate my dorm room. I wanna stay here, Kol more than anything. Then what are we waiting for? Let's do it together. What have you done? This will hold you till dark. And when the veil is back up, this town will be rid of you. - But everything you just said - Is true. But we don't always get what we want, do we? What's wrong, laddie? Can't swim? What the hell happened to you? Oh. Oh, will you look at that? That is nasty. Connor. Heh. He must've laced these bullets with werewolf venom. Ding, ding, ding. You're not as dumb as you sound. This was all a lie, eh? You knew you were a dead man. Well, you're not getting this back. - Where'd you put Silas? - Heh. One more jolt of werewolf toxin and you'll be dead within minutes. Where's Silas? Oops. One slight problem. You mean this? Yes. Yes, that. Katherine Wilson. I would love nothing more than to get out of here before Vaughn comes back to life. But Damon won't take the cure. He wants it for Elena. All right, hang on a little longer. Caroline's calling Klaus again. Stefan, we are past the point of Hail Mary phone calls. What do you want me to do? Watch him die? Or force-feed him the cure? Stefan. Remember us, Caroline? There are plenty more of these to go around. Who's next? I can do this all day. Hi. - Are you feeling better? - Yeah. - So it's all healed up? - Fresh as a daisy. Good. Ouch. Yeah, I taught her that swing. - Ha, ha. - You know it's not polite to eavesdrop. Hey, I'm short on time here. Don't rob me of what little joy I have. - Anyone seen Jeremy? - Oh, he went to see Bonnie. He'll be back later, you know, before Well, you know. Yeah. Stefan, can I, um? - Can I have a moment? - Sure. This could get interesting. - Usually does. - So the Other Side not exactly a party, is it? I've lived better. You know there's something else out there, right? There has to be. Silas's whole agenda was to find peace with his one true love. Whatever peace is, it's out there. I figure once we've served our time for all the bad things we've done then it's just about letting go. Moving on. How are we supposed to do that when the knuckleheads we care about can't seem to keep their lives straight? Yeah. So, uh, what's up? Honestly, Stefan, I just wanted to thank you. For sticking by me when I was at my worst. For believing that I was still in there. Even after everything I put you through, you You never gave up on me. I kind of owed you one. Heh. Here. It's yours. I want you to have it. No, Elena, I'm not Stefan, the only person worse at being a vampire than me is you. Human blood is your downfall. You got the raw end of the vampire deal. The rest of us will be fine. We'll survive. I mean, you taught us. You deserve whatever you want out of life. You deserve this. How'd you get here so fast? I was already on my way. I received your graduation announcement. It was very subtle. I assume you're expecting cash? That. Or a mini-fridge. Well, I had considered offering you a first-class ticket to join me in New Orleans. But I knew what your answer would be. So I opted for something I knew you would accept. Tyler is now free to return to Mystic Falls. What? He's your first love. I intend to be your last. However long it takes. Congratulations, Caroline. Let's get out of here before 12 angry hybrids decide to pick a fight. I wanted to apologize. - Good. - Let me finish. I said I wanted to. And then I realized, I'm not sorry. You would rather die than be human, and you expect me to be okay with that? I didn't say you're supposed to be okay with it, I just said I'm not sorry. But you know what I really am? Selfish. Because I make bad choices that hurt you. Yes, I would've rather have died than be human. I'd rather die now than spend a handful of years with you only to lose you when I'm old and miserable and you're still you. I'd rather die right now than spend my final years remembering how good I had it and how happy I was. Because that's who I am, Elena. And I'm not gonna change. And there's no apology in the world that encompasses all the reasons that I'm wrong for you. Fine. Then I'm not sorry, either. I'm not sorry that I met you. I'm not sorry that knowing you has made me question everything. That in death, you're the one that made me feel most alive. You've been a terrible person. You've made all the wrong choices. And of all the choices I've made, this will prove to be the worst but I'm not sorry that I'm in love with you. I love you, Damon. I love you. Now who's eavesdropping? Stefan? Think the quarry will be deep enough to bury Silas? Yeah, I don't think anyone's gonna stumble on him there. - Yeah. - You want me to, uh? No, it's all right. I got Lexi coming with me. Right. Yeah. Hey, Damon. Yeah? I'm not happy about Elena. But I'm not not happy for you, either. I just want you to know that. Thanks, brother. - Hey. - Hey. I needed to see you. I need to close the veil, Jer. - The hybrids and the hunters - I get it. I'm ready. I just wanted to be with you when it happened. - Did you and Elena? - I can't. I can't say goodbye to her. We said no tears and I left her a letter. She'll find it when all this is over. I'm ready. Moon's full. Where's Elena? She went to find Bonnie and Jeremy. She was worried about the time. What? You got the girl, man. I got the girl. Now, don't screw it up. Well, with you looking over my shoulder, how can I? - New York? - Too close. - Ah! Vegas. - Ugh. No, too touristy. Look, I know you think I'm joking, but you are leaving. You just graduated for the millionth time. It's time to start living your life. What if Elena was the one? She was. And she will always be an epic love. Contrary to popular belief, there are actually multiple ones. Especially for a vampire. The only way to find another is to let go. And move on. I've never been to Portland. See you, Lexi. Bonnie? - Jer? Are you guys here? - Well, well. Speaking of unfinished business. Happy graduation, cupcake. It's almost closed. So this is it? There were a million things I wanted to say, but nothing seems right. Then don't say anything. What's happening? Oh, my God. - What is it? - It worked, Jer. I did a spell that brought you back. I didn't think it would work but I closed the veil and you're still here. Heh. I'm alive? I can't feel your hand. What's going on? Why can't I feel you? It's okay. Bonnie, what did you do? I have the witches. And my grams. You can see ghosts. We can talk whenever we want. No. No. No, you can't be dead. Do me this one favor. Can you tell Elena and Caroline I'm spending the summer with my mom? No, I can't. They need to know. For the first time in forever, my friends are okay. I don't wanna take that from them. I'm gonna be okay. I promise. Hey. What are you doing here? I just wanted to see if you were okay. Rough day and whatnot. Thanks. Look, I'd invite you in, but I promised Tyler I was gonna keep this a low-vampire zone. I know that we were under duress today so whatever, you know, plans that we were making I understand if you don't want to. You and I, this isn't gonna work. I need to keep my love life a low-vampire zone too, okay? Of course. I get it. So whatever happens on the road, stays on the road, all right? That little wedding town in Italy, don't get any ideas about turning me into a vampire so we can live eternally ever after. I'm sorry, are you saying that you? I've never set one foot outside of this town. I have no college plans. No idea what the future holds for me. But I do know it's time I start truly living. And since you almost killed me this year I figured it's your obligation to show me how. Okay. What are you doing? Would you believe I'm having a bad day? It started when Bonnie denied me my Silas-like immortality. Of course, Katherine Pierce can't be happy with good old vampire-caliber immortality. I deserved it. I never had a graduation or a prom, or, you know, a life. But you did. You have everything. And it's not because you're a good little girl who deserves happiness. It's because you stole mine. I stole your happiness? You killed my brother. I'll admit, that was nasty. I have nothing. But I'm about to change that. Kicking someone while they're down. Classy till the end, Katherine. Heh. Your end. You deserve whatever you want out of life. You deserve this. Listen, I'm glad you're okay with who you are now but everything single thing I did to get this I did for you. So that the choice of whether you wanted to be a vampire or not would always be yours. Bye-bye, little girl. No. Have a nice human life, Katherine. Don't bother. I'm not there. Silas? You were stone. They saw you. The spell worked. That's the funny thing about spells. They're bound by nature and nature demands balance. So every spell has a loophole. The spell that turned me to stone was bound by a witch. A living witch. So when that witch died, the spell broke. Bonnie? - Bonnie's not dead. - It doesn't matter, does it? And here's where the mystery of me comes full circle. I created the immortality spell I could never die, so nature needed to find a balance. A version of me that could die. A shadow self. A doppelgÃ¤nger. So this is finally your real face? You're another one of them? Not exactly. Hello, my shadow self. Do you have any idea what it's like to starve for 2000 years?
