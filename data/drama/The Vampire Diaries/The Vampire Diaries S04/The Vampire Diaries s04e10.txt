My name is Elena Gilbert, and I'm a vampire.
I'm learning how to survive, but there are complications.
You're sired to me.
Everything that you think you feel might not be real.
But there's hope now.
Tell him what the hunter told you.
He said there was a cure.
Everyone wants it for a different reason.
- For revenge.
- Ahh! To be human and in love.
- For the truth.
- I'm setting you free, Elena.
- And some will stop at nothing to get it.
- Do it! Carol Lockwood always said that togetherness, in times of tragedy leads to healing.
That one community is stronger than a thousand of its members.
But how does a community stay strong after losing its leader? And Carol was so much more than just a mayor.
She was an open-minded friend and a concerned mother taken from us too soon by a terrible accident.
Screw this.
Tyler.
Tyler, wait.
Please join me in observing a minute of silence in her memory.
You okay? I'll be right back.
Thank you very much.
In the wake of this tragedy, the town has selected an interim mayor.
Many of you may already know him.
Please welcome Mr.
Rudy Hopkins.
Thank you, sheriff.
Carol Lockwood put this town first and that's why I'm here to talk to you guys.
You folks are the future of Mystic Falls April? What's wrong? Nothing.
I'm fine.
But you're crying.
It's just the whole mayor thing.
You know, it's bringing up stuff with my dad.
And I know you're a vampire.
Wait, what? Was that necessary? No, but it was fun.
Hey, you just missed the mandatory all-school assembly.
That's because I'm at a mandatory all-alone drinking party.
Seriously? You decided to go on a Ripper bender now? My brother slept with Elena.
- Puts a bit of a damper on things.
- First of all, you're not supposed to know.
Second of all, Tyler is already spiraling and he gets priority.
His mother just died, what do you expect? I'm his girlfriend, I expect him to talk.
Instead, he's angry.
It doesn't help everyone's referring to his mom's death as an accident which is really just a polite way of saying that she was drunk.
Do you think Klaus killed her? I don't think she drowned in her martini glass.
Just get it together.
I can't do it alone.
The assembly's over.
- What the hell is going on? - The school will be empty soon.
How many times did you compel me? Don't Just don't lie.
Rebekah says you lie.
Rebekah's not who you think she is, April.
She's not a thousand-year-old Original vampire? Listen, we can figure this out.
But we have to get out of here.
Sorry.
Not allowed.
Why don't you take a seat? The rest of the class will be here shortly.
First saved message.
Hey, it's me.
Look, I know why you sent me away.
You think what I'm feeling for you is because of the sire bond.
But I hate not being near you.
All right, go ahead.
Make a move.
I drove up here to be your wingman, not kick your ass.
All right.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're a badass.
- You see that? - Couldn't miss it.
It was in slow motion.
Then teach me something useful.
We've been here for days and so far all you've done is bark orders.
Okay.
Take a seat at the bench, quarterback.
Karate Kid wants a shot at the title.
Jeremy, you're not ready for this.
Well? Now, all I have to do is apply a little pressure under your jaw.
Really? Again? Double pepperoni three days in a row.
- You guys eat anything else? - Why, are you offering? A little something extra to cut off the pizza pipeline.
No matter how much they beg, don't come back.
Sorry, guys.
- You're gonna starve us now? - If that's what it takes to make you a hunter.
Now run around the lake.
Twice.
You keep him company.
- I don't have to listen to you.
- You do if you want to eat.
Being near you.
And I miss you, Damon.
I wish you'd just let me come to you.
- What? - Guess who? I'm back, dagger-free and I'm holding Elena hostage at school.
Thought you should know.
Who was dumb enough to pull that dagger out? I'll be asking the questions today.
See you soon.
I'm only ready to talk to you if you're ready to rejoin civilization.
How would you like to drive the white oak stake through Rebekah's heart? If it means you not drinking your way through the Mystic Grill, sure.
So first speech under your belt.
Now for the fun part.
Welcome to the world of careful cover-ups.
We've ruled Carol's death as head trauma from a fall.
That's the official autopsy.
She did not go gently, did she? Any leads? We have ideas.
Let me guess, sharp teeth and bad table manners? Are you sure you want this? I mean, six people were offered this job before you.
They all said no for a reason.
I'm saying yes for a reason.
And my reason just walked in.
- I'll let you know what we find.
- Thank you, sheriff.
- Hey, sheriff.
Hey, Dad.
- Hey.
So far cry from being a traveling pharmaceutical rep.
I noticed a few of your friends missing from the assembly.
- So much for mandatory, I guess, huh? - Dad, stop.
You can't come in here and start making rules.
I think this town could use a few more rules.
You're forgetting I can help protect the town.
I am well aware of your gifts, Bonnie.
But don't forget I'm your father.
That means that I get to protect you.
Hello, Stefan.
I'm here.
What do you want? Same thing I wanted when you helped Niklaus dagger me.
The cure.
I hope you're not waiting for Caroline to show up and stake me.
Because I already found her.
Stefan.
Did I say you could move? Class is in session.
You've all been compelled, you know the rules.
Answer my questions honestly.
No disobedience, no one leaves.
April, my sweet, take notes.
This is how you get answers in this town.
Let's start with a little quiz.
In the year 1114, my brother learned, thanks to yours truly about a brotherhood of vampire hunters with tattoos that grew with each kill.
These tattoos revealed what, Elena? A map.
Which led to, Caroline? A cure for vampirism.
Perfect.
So we're all caught up.
Stefan Salvatore, the last time we saw each other, you had a vampire hunter.
But in order to decode the map, you needed the location of the hunter's sword which you got out of me using some very dirty tricks.
Assuming you found the sword, you also found the cure and yet you're all still vampires.
Something went wrong.
What are you doing? - Oh, you asked me to take notes.
- I wasn't being literal, darling.
Now that you mention it, a flow chart would be nice.
Which means index cards and push pins.
Go fetch.
You're wasting your time.
- We don't know anything.
- So you just gave up? I thought you'd do anything to save Elena.
Even if it meant taking the cure yourself so you could grow old and die with her.
Why do you look so surprised? I'm missing something.
What is it? They broke up, okay? Now let us go.
Broke up? Wait, I'm confused.
I thought Elena was your epic love, Stefan.
I asked you what happened.
You have to tell me.
She slept with Damon.
Good.
Now Do it like your life depends on it.
Because it does.
Don't act like you care.
You care about Hunter's Mark and curing Elena so she's not sired to you.
Both require you to be alive.
Which is why I've updated our relationship status to "it's complicated.
" Have you talked to her at all? - Elena? - Maybe.
Why? Running out of voicemails to listen to? - I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt playtime? - What the hell are you doing here? I'm simply appreciating the sights and smells of nature.
Neither of which presently include rotting vampire flesh, so I'm a bit concerned.
How many vampires has he killed? If we throw Jeremy out into the world right now, he's chum.
Yeah, see, that's not a number.
Twelve, that's a number.
That's how many of my hybrids I slaughtered with my sword.
Three.
That's how many days it took to quell the urge to kill your brother after he knowingly watched as I walked into a death trap.
One.
That's the number of purposes you serve.
You are here to grow Jeremy's mark.
So I'll ask again how many vampires has he killed since he's been here? Zero.
- That's a pity.
- Mm.
I'm gonna need that cure sooner rather than later.
Hybrid shortage and all.
How can I help? You know now that you mention it.
Jeremy, watch and learn.
That's for Carol Lockwood.
So vampire Elena is a trollop who likes bad boys which explains why Stefan reeks of alcohol.
But what it doesn't explain is why sweet, loving innocent Elena could be so heartless towards Stefan.
How could she hurt you like that? Answer, please.
She didn't know it at the time, but she was sired to Damon.
A sire bond? That's fascinating.
And what do you think about that, Elena? I think you're sad.
And bored.
And in desperate need of a hobby.
You're hiding something.
Fess up.
I didn't sleep with Damon because I'm sired.
I slept with Damon because I'm in love with him.
What does any of this have to do with the stupid cure? You're right.
We've got off the point.
Stefan, how do I find the cure? Unless you'd rather talk about Damon and Elena all day.
There's a professor.
He knows where the cure is.
Thank you.
And, uh, where do I find this professor? Okay, so now I'm gifted? He hates my witch heritage.
That's why he travels, he can't handle it.
And then suddenly he wants to be a protective father? No.
Not like this.
Come on, distract me.
Isn't there some magic therapy thing you haven't shown me yet? Listen, Bonnie, I hate to tell you.
Actually, I take that back.
I'm proud to tell you this: You don't need my help anymore.
In fact I was hoping to present this with a cupcake or something, but Happy graduation.
- It's beautiful.
- It's human bone.
Oh.
Legend says it was worn by the 2000-year-old witch, Qetsiyah who drew on it for strength.
Bonnie, you have come so far so fast.
You trust my opinion, your magic is exactly where it needs to be.
Does this mean I have to go home now? Stack of papers I gotta grade by tomorrow.
I can take a hint.
Thanks, Shane.
Oh, my God.
Kol.
Shane? I told you I don't want to talk.
I heard.
You're keeping all that rage bottled up inside.
Caroline's worried sick about you.
- Rebekah? - Hello, Tyler.
I heard my brother made a real mess of your life.
Believe me, I can relate.
You have my condolences.
Why don't you come down to the high school and accept them in person? - And why would I do that? - Because I have your girlfriend.
Maybe you have a better shot at saving her than you did your mother.
Bye now.
Sister.
Look at this.
You're even worse than Klaus.
Kol.
Finally.
Did you bring what I asked for? You must be Shane.
If you're here for payback, go for it.
Because you'll be stuck babysitting the little hunter.
You know if you adjust your angle a little bit, you'll find the sharper edge.
I know how to whittle, thanks.
Now I know why those hybrids hated you.
You are annoying.
Actually, I'm just perplexed, as to why Jeremy hasn't killed any vampires.
Darwinism, Klaus.
He needs to be able to protect himself before we hunt down his first vampire nest.
And here was I thinking you were the fun brother.
Let's play a game, shall we? Jeremy needs more victims and there's a town of people waiting to be turned into vampires for slaughter.
- You don't think that occurred to me? - The tragedy is, Damon it did occur to you and yet you chose to ignore it.
My guess is you did it to impress Elena.
Somehow, to honor her, you'll find a way to spare lives and walk Jeremy down the moral high road.
That's why I've already made the necessary corrections.
What did you do? - Don't tell me we ordered another pizza.
- No, I'm just an idiot.
I ran out of gas and my phone's dead.
You think I could use yours? Yeah.
Come in, I'll run upstairs and grab my cell.
What the hell? What are you doing here? Car drama.
Your friend just went to go get his phone.
Well, I'm about to go take a shower, but you're more than welcome to wait inside.
Thanks.
Kol and Rebekah Mikaelson.
Two members of the Original vampire family.
This is such a trip.
Where's the cure? Compulsion won't work.
It's a little trick I picked up in Tibet.
Right, well, we'll just have to do this the old-fashioned way.
Beat him until he tells you where to find it.
Still glued to your seats? Oh, it's thick with tension in here.
Let's spice things up a bit.
Elena, truth or dare.
We're done playing your stupid games.
Truth or dare, Elena? You're compelled, answer.
Dare.
I dare you to tell Stefan the truth about Damon.
Seriously? Being with Damon makes me happy.
Makes you happy? Heh.
Clowns make you happy, Elena.
Dig a little deeper.
When I'm with him it feels unpredictable.
Like I'm free.
- How do you feel when you're with Stefan? - Stop.
She can't.
She's compelled.
Lately, I feel like I'm a project.
Like I'm a problem that needs to be fixed.
I think I make him sad.
And I can't be with someone like that because when he looks at me, all he sees is a broken toy.
Do you still love Stefan? Yes.
Are you still in love with Stefan? No.
Did that hurt? Having someone you love drive a dagger through your heart? - Go to hell.
- Did that hurt? Yes.
Welcome to the last 900 years of my life.
Ah, good, you're here.
It was just getting depressing.
What the hell is going on? Listen to the rules carefully.
Stay in the building.
- No vamp running in the hallways.
- Vamp running from what? - Turn.
- What? No.
You can't.
He'll lose control.
That's the whole point.
I've exhausted all your knowledge.
I have the professor to help me find the cure.
You're just competition.
Whoever finds it gets to decide what to do with it.
Use it, share it, destroy it.
Save it.
I want that to be me.
But if I turn, I'll kill them.
Yes, you will.
Turn.
Did you find your phone? Bonnie? How did you know everyone was here? - Who's everyone? I came to find Shane.
- Did you do a GPS magic locator spell? - Rebekah told me that you're a witch.
- Rebekah? What the hell is going on? Rebekah has Stefan, Elena and Caroline compelled.
She's getting them to actually tell the truth for a change.
- What? - Shane can't be compelled.
She'll happily torture him to find out what he knows.
- What are you looking for? - I need salt.
I think I just saw some.
What are you doing? This pendant will connect me to Shane.
Then I can do a protection spell.
Where is the cure? Where is the cure? You're human.
Why do you want it? That's the beauty of this.
You can have it.
I just want Silas.
No.
What do you know about Silas? He's the world's first immortal being.
Who just happens to be imprisoned with the cure.
And I want to free him.
No! April? What's happening? Stop! - He's no use dead.
- Did you not hear what he said? - Silas will kill us all, sister.
- Silas does not exist.
He is a fairy tale made up to scare children into eating their vegetables.
Silas is very real.
I know where he's buried.
And soon I'll have a spell that wakes him.
Wait a second.
You're lying.
- You can't get to him.
- Without his tombstone? Dozens to die in a blood sacrifice? Believe me, I know.
I've done it.
Those massacres are a pain to engineer.
You're the one who got the Council blown up.
It was a noble sacrifice.
And temporary.
Because once I raise Silas Silas will raise the dead.
He will bring back every last soul who died on his behalf.
No! Oh, my God.
I can fight this.
Get out of here! Go.
That door's not gonna hold him.
- You should be thanking me.
- You killed my chance at finding the cure.
Silas on the loose would be hell on earth.
And frankly, sister I don't think you could handle it.
- How did you get that? - Way too easily.
Bonnie.
Help! Someone help! Bonnie? What's going on? - She needs help.
- What happened? I did a protection spell, but it accidentally linked Shane to April.
- You couldn't control it? - I didn't know.
Usually I feel pain or I bleed.
But this time I just felt more power.
It's okay.
It's okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Bonnie, get her out of the school.
Just be careful.
Tyler's out there and he turned.
- What about you? - No, we can't leave.
Rebekah's compelled us.
Just go.
We'll deal with her later.
Come on.
- Stefan.
- No.
Stefan, we have to talk about this.
Please.
Talk about what, huh? How many more ways are there for you to rip my heart out? - I'm sorry.
- Sorry it happened or sorry I found out? I'm sorry about all of it.
I'm really sorry, Stefan.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I didn't want that.
Why are my least favorite people always the most durable? Tyler.
I'm so sorry.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Yes, it was.
This whole thing.
This is all my fault.
No.
I should've saved her.
Leave her out of this.
This is between me and you.
You're still protecting her.
Must I rip your bleeding heart from your chest and show you the scar tissue that is Elena Gilbert? There's a solution to all your problems, you know.
I could compel him.
Erase every memory he has of you.
Every day you've spent together, every kiss every lie, every ounce of pain.
I can take away every bit of love he has for you.
Give you both a clean slate.
Just say the word, and I'll make you and all that misery you've caused him disappear.
Do it.
Excuse me? Erase it all.
Every memory.
- Stefan, no.
- I said, do it.
No.
That would be far too easy.
I refuse to make you forget her the way Klaus made you forget me.
But at least you know how he really feels.
Consider your eternity of pain my revenge, Stefan.
I've used you for all you're worth, so now you're all free to go.
Stefan, wait.
Turns out I miscalculated.
Kol's gonna be a problem.
I almost killed someone.
And that's what you miscalculated? April could've died today.
You didn't know the extent of your abilities.
My father just became mayor.
I can't be out doing black magic.
That's not what Expression is.
Then what is it? A way of doing magic that isn't monitored by nature or the spirits.
It isn't good or bad.
But it also has no limits.
So how you use it is up to you.
That's what I'm here for.
To help you.
Bonnie, listen to me.
You are the key to everything.
I'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you.
Hope your day's going better than mine.
Gotta say I'm liking the odds.
Stefan knows about us.
Ooh.
How'd he take it? How do you think? I'm thinking for the first time all week, I'm happy to be at Camp Nowhere.
How's Jeremy? That depends on how much you trust me.
You know that I trust you.
I think he's gonna get through this just fine.
Thanks for looking out for him.
Yeah, well, I told them if they were good I'd buy them ice cream.
Look, I gotta go.
Not yet.
Something happened today.
I realized something about you, about us.
And you can say that it's the sire bond.
You know what, maybe it is.
But I'm telling you it's the most real thing that I've ever felt in my entire life.
I love you, Damon.
I love you.
Look I'm gonna get this cure for you.
And I'm gonna have to do things you're not gonna like.
- Damon.
- But listen carefully.
Get in your car.
Right now.
Come to me.
I'll be there soon.
- Please, let yourself in.
- You called me.
Should I be checking for hidden daggers? - Do you still want to find the cure? - More than anything.
I want to ram it down Niklaus's throat and look into his eyes as he realizes he's mortal again.
But Shane's dead and you are useless, so I'm right back where I started.
Shane's not dead.
But I watched Kol impale him.
Well, you probably shouldn't have left him alone.
Bonnie did a little spell.
He's perfectly fine.
You didn't have to tell me that.
Why am I really here? You were right.
I'm gonna be here for an eternity.
And I will go insane if I don't know how Elena truly feels about my brother.
Well, if you really want the cure, you should know that Shane has an agenda.
And it's a dark one.
He said he organized dozens of people to die in sacrifice.
He admitted to the Council explosion where 12 people died.
And I'm guessing it's no coincidence that Twelve.
Channeling the energy from a mass death is used in witchcraft to perform dark spells.
It's called Expression.
Shane admitted all this to you? Proudly.
We'll have to figure out how to manage him while we find the cure for ourselves.
- "We"? - Mm.
There's no "we," Stefan.
Listen, I hate my brother.
And you hate yours.
But Damon's got Jeremy.
Klaus has the sword.
And Shane has Bonnie.
You and I are the ones left with nothing.
You said it yourself, right? Whoever finds the cure first gets to decide what to do with it.
So, what do you say? Do you wanna be partners? My father had no reason to kill eleven people.
He had no reason to kill himself.
He loved me.
He loved Mystic Falls.
He was brainwashed into sparking that fire.
Professor Shane organized his death and the eleven others who died with him.
It's time this entire town started telling the truth.
I was beginning to worry you boys wouldn't find the place.
What the hell? Did you kill all these people? Not exactly.
They're in transition.
Killing them is your job.
You said you were gonna convince Klaus to do this another way.
Well, I thought about it.
And then I realized his idea was better.
