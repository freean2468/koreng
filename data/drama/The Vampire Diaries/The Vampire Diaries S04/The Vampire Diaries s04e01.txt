Mystic Falls.
I was born here.
- This is my home.
- And mine.
And mine.
For centuries, supernatural creatures have lived among us.
There are vampires.
Werewolves.
DoppelgÃ¤ngers.
- Witches.
- Even hybrids.
There are those who protect them.
The sheriff has a vampire for a daughter.
And our lovely mayor, a son who is half-vampire, half-werewolf.
And those who want them dead.
- They're our friends.
- Our enemies.
The ones we love.
And the ones we've lost.
Matt, look out.
And then there's me.
I'm human.
At least, I was.
Stefan? Hey.
I'm right here.
You've been in and out for hours.
What happened? You were in an accident.
- Oh, my God.
Matt, is he? - Alive? Ask Stefan.
The hero.
He's fine.
Thank you.
I thought that I How did you? Save you? He didn't.
When Jeremy brought you to the hospital before all this happened your injuries were worse than anyone knew.
Meredith Fell made a choice.
She used Damon's blood to heal you.
When Rebekah ran Matt's truck off the road, you had vampire blood in your system.
Oh, my God.
Does that mean that I Am I dead? No.
No.
No, that wasn't supposed to happen.
Maybe it doesn't have to.
I talked to Bonnie, she's stronger than ever.
- There may be something she can do.
- All that will help is for you to feed and complete the transition.
We have all day before she has to feed.
- A day to exhaust every possible way out.
- There is no way out of it.
We all know the drill.
You feed or you die.
There is no door number three.
I was ready to die.
I was supposed to die.
I don't want to be I can't be a vampire.
If there's something Bonnie can do, we have to try.
We will.
We'll try everything.
Your choice, Elena.
As always.
Way to get her hopes up for something that's never happened in history.
You weren't there when Elena told me she absolutely never wanted this.
You shouldn't have let her die.
I never meant for that.
She asked me to help Matt first.
And now the world has one more quarterback.
Bravo, brother.
I made a choice that I will regret for the rest of my life.
Now let me try to fix it.
Jer.
Are you okay? I watched Vicki go through this.
She was a mess.
Her emotions were all over the place.
All these old memories came flooding back.
I'm fine.
I'm not Vicki.
No, you're you.
You act like everything's okay so no one worries about you.
- But you need help.
- I said I'm fine, okay? I'm sorry.
- Have you talked to Bonnie? - Yeah.
When I was shot, she pleaded to the witch spirits to bring me back.
- And they listened.
- The consequences were horrible.
More horrible than you turning into a vampire? I need my sister.
Not another one of them.
We're going to find a way out of this.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I hope so.
It's beautiful, isn't it? What is that doing here? The deal we made with Tyler was you'd leave his body and jump into someone else's.
Yes, when I assumed I'd be a pile of ash.
But apparently fate and oxygen intervened, and there I am.
- Put me back.
- I can't right now.
Your history teacher outed Tyler and Caroline to the Council.
They're on a warpath and this body's vulnerable.
- I have to help Elena before she has to feed.
- She's dead.
Not my concern.
- You're forgetting who saved your life.
- You're forgetting I can rip your tongue out.
Now put me back.
If I can keep Elena human, you'll have an endless blood supply to make your hybrids.
Isn't that what you want? Same rules apply.
No one knows.
No one.
Do you understand me, Bonnie? Pastor Young, to what do we owe the honor? - Don't tell me it's your blood pressure again.
- Honestly, I wish it were.
Blood bank's in the basement.
One of you sweep the rooms.
- What are you doing? - Adding security measures.
The blood here has a habit of flying off the shelves.
- Who gave you that authority? - The Council.
They've entrusted me to secure the town.
Unlike some of our founding families I don't have conflicting interests.
- What's that mean? Alaric Saltzman told us everything.
Probably time to start looking for a new job.
Elena doesn't wanna be a vampire.
She doesn't want to be dead.
And now she's not.
- This isn't your fault, Matt.
- It's all my fault.
I was driving.
I was saved.
She's a vampire because of me.
Shh.
Cool it on the V-word.
I'm a fugitive.
I'm supposed to be halfway to Florida.
If the Council's after you, why are you here? Because I don't know where to go.
Tyler's dead.
Everything's different now.
- Can I help you? - Sorry.
All good here.
What's going on? We need to ask you about your son.
- You can't arrest me.
I'm the mayor.
- Not anymore you're not.
Sorry, Liz.
You're not going to work today.
What are you talking about? What's going on? They're taking your badge.
You're not fit to protect us anymore.
- You have no idea what you're up against.
- On the contrary, Liz.
I've taken your deputies.
Got the town's vervain supply.
Including a stash found at the Salvatore house.
We're making our move.
Mom.
Hey.
Where are you? Tell me it's far away.
Where am I? Good question.
Uh, just a whole lot of boring highways.
Why? Is everything okay? Caroline, what's going on? - It's disgusting.
- No, it's, um - Disgusting.
- Yeah, I'm gonna puke.
I never thought I'd be saying this, but I can't stop thinking about blood.
I should have saved you first.
- You shouldn't be going through this.
- If you had saved me, Matt would be dead.
What do you think I'd be going through then? Stefan, listen to me.
You did the right thing.
You did what you always do, you respected my choice.
What do I do if Bonnie can't figure a way to help? Because then you'll have another choice, either let yourself die or be a vampire.
- We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Heh.
Oh, my God.
Did I just say cross that bridge? You're laughing.
I'm pretty sure you don't actually think that's funny.
Ha-ha-ha.
I can't stop.
Your emotions are a bit heightened today.
A lot heightened.
Hey.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry, I Listen to me.
No matter what happens, I'm here for you.
I can help you.
Yeah.
Why don't you go back upstairs where it's dark? I'll clean up.
- I thought you left.
- Cute p.
j.
's.
I'm tired, Damon.
I brought you this.
I thought that was gone.
Thank you.
I just have to say something.
Why do you have to say it with my necklace? Because what I'm about to say is probably the most selfish thing I've ever said in my life.
Damon, don't go there.
I just have to say it once.
You just need to hear it.
I love you, Elena.
And it's because I love you that I can't be selfish with you.
That's why you can't know this.
I don't deserve you.
But my brother does.
God, I wish you didn't have to forget this.
But you do.
You should know better than to sneak up on a lady.
Good advice.
Have you seen one? Tragic about Elena.
Not to make a gray cloud grayer, but does Matt even have automobile insurance? Stefan? Elena, don't move.
Ah, you incessant woman.
- Hey, Mom.
What's up? - Tyler, thank God.
Are you okay? Fine, why? What's going on? Pastor Young had me arrested this morning.
The Council grilled me on your whereabouts.
Don't tell me where you are.
The less I know the better.
Mom, I'm okay.
Relax.
You didn't answer your phone.
I was scared you were with Caroline.
Why? What happened to Caroline? - The Council took her.
- What do you mean they took her? Vervain ropes.
Looks like Alaric outed us all to the Council.
The Council? What exactly do they think they can do to me? What the hell happened? - Tyler? - I'm harder to kill than you think.
You're alive? - How are you alive? - No time.
Come on, we gotta go.
Wait.
What about me? Keep them busy, little sister.
No.
That's not possible.
They're gone.
Whoever nailed Rebekah took them too.
Please tell me you have something.
Anything.
I can't.
The Council locked Carol and me out of our offices, files, computers, everything.
So the mayor and the sheriff never contemplated a back-up plan, Liz? Damon, relax.
When Caroline called, did she know where they were taking her? No, she was in some van in the middle of nowhere and managed to escape.
Perfect.
We've narrowed it down to nowhere.
Hey.
Is Elena here? In what world are you the one that gets to live? - Damon, stop.
It wasn't his fault.
- Let him go, Damon.
Now.
Still wanna be a writer? I remember how you'd read your stories to my daughter when you'd babysit.
She still loves writing because of you.
- Why did you bring me here? - My deputies can watch out for us here.
No vampires have been invited in.
Elena, I know it sounds crazy, but years ago it was your parents who were advocating having an emergency plan like this.
Never thought we'd actually have to use it.
Elena? Elena, are you okay? Where's Stefan? Where he can't hurt you.
He would never hurt me.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
I know that wherever you go, Salvatore vampires seem to follow.
- You hungry? - No.
So we'll hold Stefan until Damon comes searching for you two.
Then we'll use Rebekah to lure her siblings back into town.
You'll give us the White Oak Stake.
And then we will exterminate the entire vampire race for good.
Something wrong? Elena, you okay? Yeah.
No, I've gotta get out of here.
Get her! I never thought I'd see you again.
I don't get it.
How are you alive? This is going to sound incredible, but Easy, love.
Wrong time, wrong place, wrong equipment.
You're miraculously alive.
We're fugitives on the run.
All signs point to hot hybrid vampire sex.
Did you just call me "love"? I don't know, love.
Did I? - What the hell did you do to Tyler? - That's what I enjoy about you.
So much more than a pretty face.
Oh, my God, you're Klaus.
You're disgusting.
And you're a glorious kisser.
Listen.
I didn't have to risk exposure to come save you.
Oh.
You do one semi-decent thing and you're my hero? Ugh, I need to sanitize my mouth.
Your mouth was all over me.
I was an innocent victim.
- Put Tyler back.
- Gladly.
Then maybe I'll take you up on your offer of hot hybrid sex.
- Spirits aren't listening.
- Is that it? Is that all we can do? - There's something else I could try.
- What? Do it.
If the witches won't help me save Elena maybe I can go to the Other Side and bring her back.
- The Other Side is for dead people.
- She's still in transition.
Not fully dead or fully alive.
What if her spirit exists on both sides? Even if it does, how can you get there? You're not dead.
No.
No, Bonnie.
I was able to stop your heart to stop Klaus'.
I'll do the same to myself.
Witches have free rein on the Other Side.
I will find Elena and bring her back with me.
- Assuming you wake up.
- I'm stronger now.
- I found a new source of power.
- A new source of power? What power is gonna let you kill yourself and bring someone back from the dead? Do you want Elena back or not? With vervain and weapons, they could be anywhere.
Come on, guys, think.
It takes a lot to hold a vampire.
- Reinforced steel, iron doors.
- The pastor has a cattle ranch.
Those pens could be modified.
It's remote, it's secluded.
Well, guess what.
Looks like you get a chance to prove how sorry you really are.
Let's go.
I thought I killed you.
Where am I? They thought you were a vampire so they stuck you with us.
- Where's Stefan? - Elena, I'm right here.
Are you okay? Stefan I didn't feed.
Ah.
I see what's going on here.
You died with vampire blood in your system and you didn't feed.
And now you're locked up in here without a drop of human blood in sight.
That is a problem.
Just ignore her.
Has anyone done the math or shall I? I'd say you've got less than three hours before I get to watch you die all over again.
My day just got a whole lot better.
Oh, my God.
Bonnie.
Bonnie, open your eyes.
I can't let you do this.
You're dying.
What the hell is that? Bonnie, no! Bonnie.
Bonnie, wake up.
Bonnie, wake up! Elena.
Come back.
Come back, Elena.
Stefan.
Stefan, something's happening.
We're going home.
No.
Grams? What are you doing? You can't be in here.
- You stay away from this sort of darkness.
- Elena needs me.
She is not your problem to solve.
Now go.
Before they try to keep you here.
Grams, please.
This magic is dark, Bonnie.
It is not nature's plan.
Touch it again and the spirits will unleash their anger in ways that will make you suffer.
Stay away.
Go! Bonnie, wake up.
Wake up! Come on.
Open your eyes.
Hey.
You're awake.
You're alive.
I couldn't do it.
It didn't work.
Stefan? What happened? I'm out of time.
I need blood.
I'm dying.
Hey! Anyone.
Hey! Will you shut up? Do you think we're afraid of you? You want more vervain? Keep it down.
Listen to me.
Elena's gonna die if you don't let her out.
Sorry.
Not my problem.
She's innocent.
Let her out.
Stop.
I said let her out! She said she's not strong enough.
You put me in here, you're strong enough to get me out.
I upset the spirits to save Elena.
I can't use that magic.
- It's too dangerous.
- Do the bloody spell.
She said she can't, okay? We'll just wait until you're strong enough to do it with traditional magic.
Right, Bonnie? - Aah! - What are you doing? Ripping Tyler's heart out.
I'll jump into someone else.
Maybe you.
- Oh, my God.
- Stop.
Stop.
- He's bluffing.
He needs a witch to do that.
- You think I don't have one? Or 10? Pick, Bonnie.
You or Tyler.
- Stop.
Please.
You're killing him.
- Fine, I'll do it.
Just stop.
Good.
Let's begin.
Elena? You still with me? Yeah.
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm okay.
No, you're not.
I can hear your breathing.
Damon was right.
You should have fed this morning.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
You had hope.
That's all I ever wanted you to have, and you had it.
I love you so much.
Do you know why I was even on that bridge? I was coming back for you, Stefan.
I had to choose, and I picked you.
Because I love you.
No matter what happens it's the best choice I ever made.
God.
It sucks that I can't see you right now.
I'm smiling.
Me too.
So, what, we just storm the place with zero weapons? Nah.
We don't need weapons.
Just bait.
Yoo-hoo.
Anybody home? There's a big, bad vampire out here.
Let him go.
The boy's innocent.
That's the point.
Give me Stefan and Elena and he's all yours.
Come on, pastor.
You know I'll kill him.
- I want to kill him.
- Go away.
You are not invited in.
And I'm not coming out.
This is black magic.
She shouldn't do this.
Tyler.
Caroline.
Hey.
Tyler.
Bonnie, what are you doing? I warned you, child.
I warned you to stay away.
Bonnie, it worked.
Stop.
- What's happening? - Let me go.
- I can't.
- Let me go.
Bonnie, what's happening? - Why can't I let go? - Bonnie, stop the spell.
You made your choice.
Now they're taking it out on me.
I'm sorry, Grams.
- You can't do this.
Please.
Don't do this to her! - Aah! - Bonnie, stop.
- No! No! Oh, my God! - What have I done? What did I do? - You're okay.
You're okay.
What did I do? What did I do? I got this.
Bring the other one in.
Excuse me? Hello, sir? Thought I told you to shut up.
Here's the thing.
My family, we have money.
Castles, apartments, jewelry.
Just name your price and let me out.
I'd much rather watch you die.
Elena.
Elena.
Go ahead and kill me.
You can't possibly hate me more than I hate myself.
Oh, yes, I can.
It should have been you.
Leave him alone.
Just stop.
Stop saving me.
- What's your problem? - What do you want me to say, thank you? Because honestly, I wish you'd just let me drown.
- What, you think you were my first choice? - Elena's a vampire because of me.
I have to live with that the rest of my life.
You don't have to live with that.
You get to live with that.
Because Elena put your life before her own.
So every morning you get out of bed you sure as hell better earn it.
- You were gonna kill him.
- Yep.
Guy just won't die.
It was my choice to save him.
Why aren't you seeing that? It's a little hard to keep track of all your choices lately, Elena.
I remember everything.
One of the highlights of my transition? Remembering everything that you compelled me to forget.
Like how you and I met first.
You were a stranger that told me you wanted me to get everything I wanted from life.
Damon, why didn't you tell me? Would it have made a difference? Didn't think so.
You asked me to make a choice, Damon, so I did.
If you're gonna be mad, take it out on me, not on Stefan, or Matt, or anyone else.
Me.
Are we done here? If it had been you at the bridge last night, and not Stefan and I begged you to save Matt I would have saved you in a heartbeat.
No question.
That's what I thought.
And Matt would be dead because you couldn't let go.
- Matt would be dead.
- But you wouldn't be.
You would've gotten to grow up, have the life you wanted.
The life you deserved.
And I know I didn't used to get that, but I do now.
And I wanted that for you, Elena.
And I would have gladly have given it to you and let Matt die, because I am that selfish.
But you knew that already.
The first night we met is not all that you remember.
How dare you save Caroline over me? Hello, brother.
I thought you were dead.
So pleased you're not.
You left me.
I had time to save one, you can't be killed.
Rest assured, I had a worse day than you.
It's time for us to move on.
Find some more werewolves.
Create your hybrid family? You don't know anything about family.
I know how easily they can be silenced with a dagger.
No! - Drop them.
- I mourned you.
- My heart broke thinking I'd never see you.
- Put the blood down, Rebekah.
Good girl.
It's always been me.
Not Finn, not Elijah, not Kol.
Me.
I loved you through everything and you don't care.
- Drop it! - You want your family? Here's your family.
Rebekah, you're right.
I don't care.
From this moment on, you're not my family, you're not my sister.
You are nothing.
The whole Council knows who we are now.
Everything's about to change.
Yeah, I'm sure Damon has a revenge plan cooked up.
We'll figure out a way to deal with it.
Stefan, you don't have to convince me that everything's gonna be okay.
I know.
Wish I could, though.
I wish I could just tell you that you'll never feel pain that you'll never crave blood.
But you will.
It'll be the worst thing that you've ever lived through.
But I'll get to live.
I'll be a sister, and a friend and I'll be with you.
Forever, if I want.
I'm gonna get through this.
Just like we get through everything.
One day at a time.
We should get inside before sunrise.
Bonnie made this for you yesterday.
Just in case.
Daylight ring? One day at a time.
Right? Folks, by now you know the vampires have escaped.
Here you go.
Thanks for coming.
And it won't be long before they retaliate.
But fear not.
I have been chosen to lead us in a movement.
- What are you talking about? - Hear me, loved ones.
Soon you'll be free to pass through the gates and we'll all reunite in eternity.
Seriously, pastor, what's going on here? Friends we are the beginning.
