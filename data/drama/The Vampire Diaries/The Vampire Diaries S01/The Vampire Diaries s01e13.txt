Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I've lived in secret.
Until now.
- I know the risk.
But I have to know her.
- Elena, a dead ringer for Katherine.
You have no idea of the future I have planned for us.
You, me and Damon.
Our love for Katherine wasn't real, Damon.
Katherine never compelled me.
I knew everything.
I'm gonna bring her back.
Tell me how to get in the tomb.
- The grimoire.
- Where is it? The journal.
Johnathan Gilbert's.
- Your ancestor's journal? - I gave it to my teacher.
- Alaric Saltzman.
- Damon.
The grimoire, it was Emily's? You need it to reverse the spell? - I'll help you.
- Okay.
I told Damon that I'd help him get Katherine back.
- But it was a lie.
I can't let him.
- Don't.
I'll help you.
Whatever it takes.
Please! Please help us.
Please.
My husband.
He's been hurt.
Please help him.
What are you two doing out here? - It's not safe.
- No.
No, sir.
It's not safe.
And that's how it's done.
What happens to the bodies? We'll take them into the woods.
The other animals will finish them off.
Are you sure you're ready for this? I'm ready.
I want you to turn me.
When it's time.
Kiss me.
You should get a taste.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.
Soon you won't be able to get enough.
Mm.
Good morning.
I could get used to this.
Rise and shine, sleepy heads.
- Please.
- What are you doing? Oh, stop being smutty.
Get out of here.
If I see something I haven't seen before, I'll throw a dollar at it.
Listen.
There's very important business to discuss.
- It has to be now? - We have lots to do.
Now that we're all friends and working toward a common goal.
So in order to open the tomb, we need to find the journal to get the grimoire to undo the spells.
Since you are Elena Gilbert, you're on journal duty.
- Since when am I helping? - Stefan's helping.
And you've taken up residency in Stefan's bed.
Ergo Don't do anything you don't wanna do.
- I'll look for it today.
- Good.
How do we know that this journal will hold the location of the grimoire? We're gonna take the word of this vampire? Seemed like a dimwit.
- In lieu of any other options.
- Okay.
What exactly is a grimoire anyway? It's a witch's cookbook.
Every spell a witch casts is unique.
Every witch would document their work.
- Yeah.
Cookbook.
- What about our mystery vampire? Dimwit, obviously, wasn't working alone so whoever is out there knows who we are.
And I don't like that disadvantage.
So chop-chop.
You know, I really like this whole menage-a-threesome team thing.
It's got a bit of a kink to it.
Ha, ha.
Don't screw it up.
He doesn't? Oh, right.
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Oh.
No.
Come here.
- We shouldn't - Shh.
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- Make me.
Yes? Excuse me, Miss Katherine.
Miss Pearl is here to see you.
I'll be down soon.
Please ask her to wait.
Thank you, Emily.
- Mm.
Fun's over.
- Mm, no.
Good to see you, Pearl.
Perhaps we could talk outside.
Emily would you please tell Mr.
Salvatore that I've stepped away? Which one? Both.
How long do you plan on staying with the Salvatores? People talk, Katherine.
You carrying on with both brothers doesn't help the situation.
The Salvatores have been kind to take me in.
As far as everyone here knows l'm a poor orphan girl from Atlanta who lost her family in the fires, heh.
A match you lit, no doubt.
Honey, please be careful.
Honoria Fell came by the apothecary yesterday with a case of this elixir.
She asked that it be sold at a reduced rate.
- I don't follow.
- Try it.
What in hell? - Vervain.
- Why is there ver? They know.
They're trying to find us.
They're getting crafty.
Townspeople ingesting vervain.
Well, that's inconvenient.
It might be time for us to move again.
No.
I like it here.
I'm not interested in leaving just yet.
Can we go, Mama? Is something wrong? Hey.
It's me again.
Anna.
Stalker chick and foosball champion.
Um, I'll be at the Grill later.
If you want, you know, a rematch or whatever.
Who are you calling? Jeremy Gilbert.
You're not, like, into him, are you? I need him for something.
Get over it.
- Damn it.
- Dude, you gotta stop doing that.
I know.
I just I keep forgetting.
You're new.
You'll get it.
You found the Gilbert journal? That look like the Gilbert journal? Well, it's old and musty and How am I supposed to know the difference? I figured maybe, just maybe you've been paying a little bit of attention since we met.
You know, you don't have to talk down to me.
I'm not stupid.
Here.
Drink.
I don't want you itchy around the witch.
She can sense if you're weak.
Mm.
When can we go hunting again? This tastes old.
I want fresh blood.
When we get that tomb open, you can kill anyone you want.
For now, just stay focused on Bonnie while I try to get the journal back from Jeremy's teacher.
Why did you choose me? I needed someone in a position to be my eyes and ears.
Small-town bartender fit the bill.
But there are plenty of bartenders to choose from.
Why me? You were sad, Ben.
You lacked purpose.
You needed me.
Do you think Damon really believes us? That we're both trying to help him? I don't think Damon knows what to believe.
Trust isn't something that comes naturally to him.
You know, I really think that Damon believes that everything he's done, every move, he's done for love.
It's twisted but kind of sad.
There are other ways to get what you want.
You don't have to kill people.
Damon has no regard for human life.
He enjoys inflicting pain on others.
For 145 years, every single time that I have let my guard down and let Damon back into my life he's done something to make me regret that.
- I'm not gonna make that mistake again.
- What will happen if the tomb gets opened and Damon gets Katherine back? I think no matter what Damon promises, a lot of people will die.
That's Johnathan Gilbert.
What's this? What are you guys doing? Hey.
Just, um, going through some stuff.
Feeling sentimental.
Dad had this old journal.
I thought I'd dig it up.
Johnathan Gilbert's journal? - Yeah.
What do you know about it? - I just did a history report on it.
- Oh.
Where is it now? - Gave it to Mr.
Saltzman.
He wanted to see it.
I met Barnette and Guiseppe this evening.
I saw the skepticism in their eyes when I showed them the compass.
We're supposed to believe that can track one of them? - What is it Magic? - It's science.
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- This church idea, I believe it could work.
Excuse me, Father, I didn't know you had guests.
- We'll be done in a few minutes.
- Forgive me, Mr.
Gilbert, Mr.
Lockwood.
- Have you told them? - Not yet.
We need all the men we can get.
I'll tell them.
You can count on both my boys.
Hello? Hello? Someone there? - Unh.
- You shouldn't have done that.
Have a seat.
What is this, compressed air? Did you make it yourself? Who are you? I'm not gonna hurt you unless you try that again.
Now who are you? I'm a teacher.
We're gonna have to do this the hard way? I'm also a historian.
And while researching Virginia, I made a few discoveries about your town.
So you show up like Van Helsing.
Come on.
Tell me the truth.
My wife was a parapsychologist.
She spent her life researching paranormal activity in this area.
- Her work led me here.
- Where is your wife? Dead.
A vampire killed her.
- Where's the Gilbert journal? - What do you want with it? - Where is it? - It's on my desk.
No, it's not.
It was on my desk.
- Anything? - Not yet.
Just a lot of gibberish.
You know, some people shouldn't journal.
I thought this Gilbert was the brains.
Don't you have a date? Yup.
Wish me luck.
I saw her again today.
The most beautiful woman in town with a name just as pretty.
Pearl.
Thought about what I've said? We'll leave soon, Pearl, I promise.
I need to take care of a few things first.
You're gonna turn both of them, aren't you? Katherine, please be careful.
We'll all be safe.
I promise.
Mr.
Gilbert's coming.
Quick.
Your cheeks.
Perfectly rosy.
Miss Pearl? May I have a moment? Yes, Mr.
Gilbert.
I'm still waiting for you to explain that comet in the sky.
Your mother has an admirer.
As descendants of the founding families they wanna know they can count on you.
- Of course they can.
Is there any doubt? I'm not sure your brother Damon understands the importance of duty.
Damon left the Confederacy on principle.
And it's his choice and should be respected.
- I have trouble respecting a deserter.
- I never asked for your respect.
Good for you, Damon.
Because all I have is disappointment.
You said the town is in trouble? There have been too many deaths.
It's time for us to fight back.
Stop these killers.
- What are you talking about? - We live amongst demons.
You're being cryptic now, Father.
Why don't you just say the word? Vampires.
They exist.
And they live amongst us.
But we have a plan to kill them.
And you're going to help us.
My father never approved of anyone I dated.
Which only made me want them more, of course.
- What about you? - There were a few guys.
Logan isn't the only loser I've dated.
They ever find him? Is he still missing? He's not missing.
He's in the Bahamas working on his tan.
Very entitled, that one.
Marches to his own drum.
He's a Fell.
They're all snooty.
Hello, Elena.
Hey.
Where have you been? We're cooking dinner.
- Stefan with you? - Um, he'll be here soon.
How long have you been aware of me? I learned just recently.
When I met your brother.
You met Damon.
Who do you think killed my wife? - You certain it was Damon? - I witnessed it.
If you're here for revenge this is gonna end very badly for you.
I wanna find out what happened to my wife.
- I thought you just said that Damon - Ah.
I saw him draining the life out of her.
He must have heard me coming.
He just disappeared.
So did her body.
They never found her.
Damon can never know why you're here.
He'll kill you without blinking.
I can take care of myself.
No, you can't.
I can help you.
If you let me.
Oh.
Mm.
- Don't do that.
- Do what? You know.
That was deliberate.
Well, yeah.
I was deliberately trying to get to the sink.
Speaking of Stefan, where is he? He's missing family night, which I am enjoying immensely.
- Is it real? - Is what real? This renewed sense of brotherhood.
Can I trust him? Yes, you can trust him.
Can I trust him? I'm wearing vervain, Damon.
It's not gonna work.
I'm not compelling you.
I just want you to answer me.
Honestly.
Of course you can.
You can trust me, Mr.
Salvatore.
I would never cheat.
I'm losing over here.
Again.
She's good.
I almost believe she genuinely likes him.
- Perhaps she does.
- Ha, ha.
She knows Father would have her killed if he knew the truth.
Not if we talked to him.
Explained how we feel.
He could help us keep her safe.
Are you going mad? No.
Father would drive a stake in her himself.
- Not true.
We can trust him.
- Not with this.
No, please Promise me you won't tell him, Stefan.
I promise.
There was a time that I trusted him more than anyone.
Trust breeds trust.
You have to give it to get it.
Are you lecturing me? Do you need to be lectured? I just want her back.
I'm sure you can understand that.
I can understand that you would do anything for her, yes.
Then you understand what I will do if anyone gets in my way.
You said you had never played this thing before.
I'm a fast learner.
Quick reflexes.
- Who are you dodging? - This girl Anna.
She can be, uh, persistent.
- Is she hot? - Yeah.
Yeah.
But she can be weird.
Pfft.
Hot trumps weird.
Trust me.
- He is ridiculously hot.
- Shh.
He's an ass.
What are you doing with this? I thought there might be something about my birth parents.
Have you told Jeremy? I will.
When the time is right.
That's Stefan.
Dude.
Well? - Admit it.
I can't sing.
- No.
You were great.
Come on.
I totally, like, trashed the Metallica song.
Well, first mistake.
Metallica karaoke? - At least I committed.
- That woman with the tattoos loved you.
Well, next time, I'm gonna throw out my Pearl Jam.
Next time? Yeah.
So, what are your friends up to tonight? Doing their own thing.
Caroline's at her dad's.
- Elena's with her boyfriend.
- Elena Gilbert? - Yeah.
- I remember you guys used to hang out.
Yeah.
She's my best friend.
My friends, they all moved away after graduation and I didn't, so we just kind of drifted apart.
Yeah.
Elena and I are bonded for life.
Ha, ha.
- I can't imagine it any other way.
- Huh.
- That tight, huh? - She's my sister.
I mean, I'd die for her.
Huh.
- Who took it? - I don't know.
It's that teacher.
There's something off about him.
No.
Somebody got to it right before me.
Who else knew it was there? No.
Damon, leave him out of it.
- Why What's the big deal? - Damon.
So I heard you found a really cool journal from back in the day.
- Who else did you show it to? - Huh? - Don't ask questions.
Just spill.
- You're kidding me, right? Did you tell anyone other than Mr.
Saltzman about Gilbert's journal? - Why is everybody obsessed with that? - Who else did you tell? - Mm, just Anna.
- The hot, weird one? - Yeah.
- Wait.
Who is Anna? That's what I wanna find out.
How do you know her? I just know her.
- She wants to meet at the Grill tonight.
- Perfect.
- I'll drive.
Come on.
- Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm alone.
Give me all the deets, Bonnie.
I'm dying.
It's going great.
He's a perfect gentleman.
- A gentleman? - I know.
Boring, huh? I just wanna grab him and lay one on him.
- So why don't you? - Because I'm a chicken.
Heh, you're a powerful witch-goddess.
Come on.
Seize the day, Broom Hilda.
Ha, ha.
Okay.
I'm gonna text you later with more details.
You better.
- Where's Damon? - He left to track down Jeremy's friend.
- See if there was anything there.
- Aren't you gonna go? - Lf he gets to the journal before we do - Doesn't matter.
- What is that? - It's a copy of it.
How did you get it? Well, Mr.
Saltzman made a copy and was kind enough to loan it to me.
- He did? - Not exactly.
But I got it.
You just couldn't live without me, huh? Well, I kind of missed my daily dose of cute stalker chick.
- Funny, ha, ha.
- Let's play.
The sheriff was here earlier.
He bought large volumes of the vervain elixir.
- Did he try to put his hands on you? - Doesn't he always? She's saving herself for Johnathan Gilbert.
- I am beyond saving.
We know that.
- Ha, ha.
How can you be so calm? - They're getting closer to you every day.
- We're respectable ladies of Mystic Falls.
Thanks to Emily, we walk the streets in daylight.
No one will ever suspect us.
Not unless a human tells them.
I'd sooner die.
And soon enough, you will.
Mrs.
Fell is approaching.
Thank you, Annabelle.
Here's a reference that he wrote about Emily.
"The Fell family believed it should be I, not them who protected the witch's spell book.
But I feared she would haunt me from the hereafter.
They mocked my fear, but it was Guiseppe Salvatore who" Is that your father? Yeah.
"It was Guiseppe Salvatore who removed my fear.
He told me he would protect the secret of the spell book.
He said he would carry it to his grave.
" Oh, Stefan.
To what do I owe this pleasure? - Did I interrupt your writing? - Dull musings of my troubled mind.
A great mind.
- I will carry the real secrets with me - To your grave.
And a full grave it will be.
Now, speaking of troubled minds, what's on yours? I have concerns about your plan for the vampires.
- And why is that? - We are making the assumption that all vampires are as evil as they have been characterized.
- But what if that's not true? - You have any evidence to the contrary? - Do you know of any vampires? - No.
No, of course not.
But are we to take what others say at face value? You always taught us so differently.
Stefan, these creatures are of the darkest parts of hell.
They have the ability to control your mind seduce your spirit.
They are deadly, and they must be destroyed.
Those who stand with them who bring shame to their families, will be destroyed as well.
I know where it is.
Okay, I give.
Okay.
Damn.
You're strong for a little thing.
I was wondering how long it would take you to find me.
Why isn't your father buried in your family's tomb? It wasn't built until well after he died.
Are you sure the grimoire is in there with him? Sure as I can be.
Great.
Elena I can do this on my own.
- I said I would do whatever I can to help.
- I know, and I appreciate that, but - This town is my home, Stefan.
My friends and family are here.
You're here.
I don't want that tomb opened any more than you do.
I'm sorry that you have to do this.
What is that? A gift.
From Damon? From Emily, actually.
And when will you stop worrying about Damon? I want you all to myself.
Ha, ha.
Just as he wants me.
But I'm the one who gets to make all the rules.
- And why is that? - Because I'm spoiled.
- Yes, you are.
- And selfish.
Mm-hm.
What? Vervain.
What? Katherine.
Katherine.
Go get the sheriff.
Tell him we have a vampire.
- What? No.
- Do as I say, son.
Nothing that you feel for her is real.
She's a vampire, Stefan.
A monster.
I fed you vervain, hoping that it would expose her.
- How did you know? - Your sympathy for their plight.
I didn't raise my sons to be so weak.
The sheriff.
Now.
Go! Quickly! Now, son.
How long have you been here? I arrived around half past comet.
Watching you screw up every chance you had to open that tomb.
How did you know about the spell? I didn't say much back then.
Which means I heard everything.
If you've been here the whole time, why are we crossing paths now? I like to use others to do my dirty work.
Like Logan Fell? Oh, yeah.
Thanks for that, by the way.
Little bastard shot me.
- Heh.
Logan was an idiot.
- Mm-hm.
Slipped him blood when he started getting slayer with that compass.
- I needed his journal.
I couldn't let him die.
- What did you want with the Fell journal? I thought it contained the location of the witch's spell book.
I was wrong.
According to her journal, Honoria gave the grimoire to Johnathan Gilbert.
And according to this he gave it to your father.
Now you're gonna help me find it.
Why would I help you? Because you and I both want that tomb open.
Hmm.
Heh.
Sorry.
I work alone.
Well, the check's paid.
I'm all yours tonight.
What do you wanna do? - What's wrong? - Nothing.
Sorry.
I should've waited till the end of the night to do that.
I didn't mind.
- I'm starting to get tired.
- You wanna go? I was gonna say have some more coffee, get a caffeine buzz and I don't know.
- Go out and do something crazy.
- Hmm, like what? Like anything.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna run to the restroom.
- Okay.
- All right.
What? Not many girls can say they've done this.
Is that it? Well, what do you know? This is an interesting turn of events.
I can't let you bring her back.
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.
For thinking for even a second I could trust you.
You are not capable of trust.
The fact you're here means you read the journal.
You were planning on doing this yourself.
Of course.
Because the only one I can count on is me.
You made sure of that many years ago, Stefan.
But you You had me fooled.
So, what are you gonna do now? Try and destroy that, I'll rip her heart out.
You won't kill her.
I can do one better.
Give me the book, Stefan.
Or I'm snapping her neck and you and I will have a vampire girlfriend.
Let her go first.
The book.
I'm not gonna give this to you until she is standing next to me.
I no longer trust that you'll give it back.
You just did the one thing that ensures that I will.
Okay.
Now, make sure the two of you stick together.
- Check those woods over there! - They're here.
- God's on our side.
- Come on, spread out now! - Come! Over here! - Joseph! - Make sure you stick together, hear? - Let's go! No! Don't take her.
You know what they'll do to you if you're branded a sympathizer? - You'll be killed along with them.
- Then let me be killed.
Aspirin must be downstairs.
Is my head supposed to hurt? No, you'll be fine.
It was just a small amount of blood.
It should pass out of your system by tomorrow.
Are you okay? Damon was right.
This is, uh This is my fault.
Look over there! Damon! Damon, stop.
Stop.
I'll help you.
- We'll get her back.
- Don't you think you've done enough? - You promised you wouldn't tell him.
- I didn't think this would happen.
There she is! You did this.
This is your fault.
I put my faith in my father.
But Damon put his faith in me.
And I destroyed that.
This is my fault.
We didn't do anything wrong.
Don't forget that.
Okay.
- I'm gonna get you that aspirin.
Okay? - Mm.
You know you're not staying the night, right? Oh, uh, we're just gonna hang out for a little while.
You're lucky I like you.
- Keep the door open.
- You got it.
- Hey, do you have any aspirin? - Yeah.
Oh, hey, Stefan.
- Where did she go? - She went to the bathroom.
- Where did who go? - He has a friend over.
Anna.
What's happening? Get Emily.
And stay hidden.
I'll get us out of here.
- Pearl! - Johnathan.
You see all this? The town's gone mad rounding up the demons.
You? L Johnathan, please.
I beg you.
I've got another one over here! - Mother! - Shh! No! Johnathan, this way! [WHISPERS.]
Shh.
It'll be all right.
You're gonna see her again.
I already know how to protect them.
I'm gonna protect them.
There's gotta be more! Don't let her get away.
Elena? ripped by looxlike
