For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.
- I know.
- I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.
- Didn't tell me he had a brother.
Being around her, does it make you feel alive? He told me about your ex, Katherine? - She broke your heart.
- That was a long time ago.
I'm gonna give you Elena's cell number.
What are you up to? That's for me to know and you to "dot, dot, dot.
" I was hoping I'd see you again.
Good morning.
Please.
Don't.
Don't do that.
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Get away from me.
No.
This could have gone a completely different way.
A waste of a butt.
Listen, I'm not saying don't date the guy, I'm just saying take it slow.
- You are the one who said to go for it.
- Now, I'm saying take it slow.
- Why the about-face? - It's not an about-face.
You're single for the first time in high school.
- It's the perfect time to play the field.
- Oh, because I'm so that girl.
- Seriously, what are you not saying? - It's stupid.
- Bonnie.
- What? - Spit it out.
- I accidentally touched Stefan and I got a really bad feeling.
- Is that it? Bonnie.
- It was "bad" bad.
- Is this the witch-mojo thing again? - Know what? I'm just concerned.
This is me expressing concern about my best friend's new boyfriend.
And I love you for it.
I do.
But I feel good.
It's been a hard year and I'm starting to kind of feel like things are getting back to normal again.
And you know what? Stefan is a big part of that.
I rock.
I scored two tickets to the Posers Saturday night.
- They're playing at The Rat.
- You and Tyler have fun.
Don't be like that.
Come on.
I want you to go.
Not worried everyone will know you're screwing the stoner geek? Wait.
- Everyone already knows.
- Yeah, but it's not like that anymore.
- So now we can be friends and hang.
- Tell me something.
Was it the drugs? Were you sleeping with me because of the drugs? - Screw you.
- Well, no.
If there's another reason please, I'm all ears.
Morning, Elena.
- Morning, Bonnie.
- Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline.
She's not answering her phone, so see you guys.
Bonnie, wait.
She doesn't like me very much.
She doesn't know you.
She's my best friend.
She's just looking out for me, but when she does, she will love you.
Look.
There's Elena and her new boyfriend.
And what are they doing? Oh, they're walking, walking, walking.
Yup.
Right into the sunset.
- You're a dick.
- While you stand there looking like one of those yard trolls.
- Gnomes.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Are you free tonight? - Yes.
- Perfect.
Dinner, my house, 8:00.
You, me and Bonnie.
You two will spend some quality time.
She'll see what a great guy you are.
Mission accomplished.
And what am I supposed to do, Ty? She made her choice.
- Let her know she made the wrong one.
- What are you doing? Ty, don't.
Ty, don't.
God.
That throw was insane.
I didn't know you played football.
I used to.
It was a long time ago.
So why don't you try out for the team? Yeah, I don't think so.
- So you don't like football.
- No, I love football.
It's a great sport.
But in this case, I don't think football likes me.
You saw Tyler over there.
And we both know how Matt feels.
They don't know you.
To them, you're a mysterious loner guy.
Wouldn't hurt to be part of.
Make some friends.
Says the girl who spends her alone time writing in a cemetery.
Hey.
Come on.
There's more to me than just gloomy-graveyard girl.
There's a whole other Elena that you have yet to meet.
- She was into everything.
Very busy.
- Well, I look forward to meeting her.
- And when will that be? - Soon.
She's working on it.
World War II ended in? Anyone got anything? Ms.
Juan? - 1945.
- Psst.
FYI, our team sucks.
They could use you.
Pearl Harbor.
- Can't, I'm a loner.
- Nothing? - Miss Gilbert Ahem.
Pearl Harbor.
- Hm? - Um - December 7th, 1941.
Thank you, Miss Gilbert.
Anytime.
Very well.
- The fall of the Berlin Wall.
- 1989.
I'm good with dates, sir.
Are you? How good? Keep it to the year.
Civil Rights Act.
- John F.
Kennedy assassination.
- 1963.
- Martin Luther King.
- '68.
- Lincoln.

- Roe v.
Wade? - 1973.

Ha! It ended in '52.
Ha-ha-ha.
Uh, actually, sir, it was '53.
Look it up.
Somebody.
- Quickly.
- It was 1953.
How did you know all of that? Years and years of crossword puzzles.
It's a loner thing.
- Damn.
- Nice job, nice job.
Mr.
Lockwood, is there anything you're good at? Because it isn't history.
And it sure as hell isn't defending the ball.
- Yes, coach.
- Now, do it again.
Oh, my God.
You're here.
Yep.
I can't be sad girl forever.
Only way to get things back to the way they were, are to do things that were.
- Oh.
And you're coming to dinner tonight.
- Am? Mm-hm.
You, me and Stefan.
- You have to give him a chance.
- Tonight's no good.
You seen Caroline? I texted her a hundred times.
Don't change the subject, Bonnie Bennett.
You're going to be there.
- Fine, I'll go.
- Good.
Varsity try-outs were last spring, Mr.
Salvatore.
I wasn't here then, sir.
Then you're not here now, as far as I'm concerned.
Mr.
Tanner, I realize that you and I didn't get off to the best start and I wanna apologize for that.
I've played football before, wide receiver, mostly.
And I'm pretty good.
I won't be asking you who won the Super Bowl in '71.
'71 was Sorry.
I understand that, sir.
Just to see you get knocked on your ass.
Borrow some gear.
Go.
Before I change my mind.
Let's run it again! First my girlfriend, now my team? Dude, this is an opportunity.
Football's a contact sport.
Sometimes people get hurt.
Whoo! Ha, ha.
Seriously, where is Caroline? I don't know.
It's not like her.
I'll try her again.
- Uh - Oh, my God.
Must be the mystery guy from the Grill.
That's not a mystery guy.
That's Damon Salvatore.
Salvatore? As in Stefan? I got the other brother.
Hope you don't mind.
Sorry I'm late, girls.
I, uh, was busy.
Let's start with the double-pike herkie hurdler.
What do you say? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four Six, seven, eight.
Elena, sweetie, why don't you just observe today? Okay? Keep going.
Okay.
Let's do it again from the top.
And five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Blue 80.
Blue 80.
Set, hut! Go! Come on, Tyler, cover him.
- Lost the cut, man.
- Go get it, Stefan.
That's the way to do it.
Again! Let's line up! - Way to go, Salvatore! - Good.
- Nice catch, Salvatore.
- Come on, man.
All right! - Don't let it slide! - Yeah, baby.
All right.
That's it.
Run that, baby.
Way to go, Salvatore.
- Good, baby.
- All right, let's go.
Hate to say it, but he's got skills.
- I think he needs a buddy pass.
- Really? You don't walk on the field and act like you own the place after five minutes.
- Hang one up, I'll take care of the rest.
- Let's do it again.
All right, let's double up! Set, hut.
There it is.
Whoo! Welcome to the team, buddy.
- Let's go.
- There you go.
You gonna live, Salvatore? Nice one.
- Yeah.
- Walk it off, son.
Hey.
That was my bad.
- It's all right.
- Yeah.
All right.
I want you to come across.
How were tryouts? Did you make the team? Very Emerson, the way you reveal your soul with so many Adjectives.
What are you doing here? I've come to apologize.
I've been doing some thinking, some soul searching and I want us to start over.
We need to put the past behind us.
You're my little brother and if you wanna live a normal, happy, human life then I want that for you.
Maybe I can do it too.
If I can learn to be a non-living living person maybe there's hope for both of us.
You know, it doesn't have to be this way, Damon.
Of course it doesn't.
I saw Elena today, BTW.
That means "by the way.
" She was at cheerleading practice.
She looked so perky in her little short shorts.
Just Simmer down, I didn't even go near her.
I've got my own cheerleader now.
Ooh.
That reminds me.
I gotta run.
I have a date.
Sweaty palms.
Wish me luck.
You explain it.
Last night, I'm watching 9-0.
Commercial break comes on and I'm like, "I bet it's that phone commercial.
" It's the guy and the girl with the bench, he flies to Paris and he flies back.
- They take a picture.
- Oh, come on.
- That commercial's on a constant loop.
- Fine.
Well, how about this? Today, I'm obsessed with numbers.
Three numbers.
I keep seeing eight, Maybe we should play the lottery.
- Have you talked to your grams? - She's just gonna say I'm a witch.
- I don't wanna be a witch.
Do you? - I don't want to be a witch.
And putting it in a nice bowl isn't fooling anybody.
Okay, serving spoons.
Where are the serving spoons? Middle drawer on your left.
Okay, you've been in this kitchen a thousand times.
Yeah, that's it.
Okay, he's here.
Don't be nervous.
Just be your normal loving self.
Birthday candles.
Did Tanner give you a hard time today? Well, he let me on the team, so I must have done something right.
Bonnie, you should have seen Stefan today.
- Tyler threw a ball right at him, and - Yeah, I heard.
Why don't you tell Stefan about your family? Um, divorced.
No mom, live with my dad.
- Mm.
- No, about the witches.
Bonnie's family has a lineage of witches.
- It's really cool.
- Cool isn't the word I'd use.
It's certainly interesting.
I'm not too versed, but I do know that there's a history of Celtic Druids that migrated here in the 1800s.
- My family came by way of Salem.
- Really? - Salem witches? - Yeah.
- I'd say that's pretty cool.
- Really? Why? Salem witches are heroic examples of individualism and nonconformity.
Yeah, they are.
I wonder who that could be.
Surprise.
Bonnie said you were doing dinner, so we brought dessert.
- Oh.
- Hope you don't mind.
- What are you doing here? - Waiting for Elena to invite me in.
- Oh, yeah, you can - No, no, no.
He can't, um He can't stay.
Can you, Damon? Get in here.
We're just finishing up.
It's fine.
Just come on in.
You have a beautiful home, Elena.
Thank you.
I cannot believe that Mr.
Tanner let you on the team.
Tyler must be seething.
But good for you.
Go for it.
That's what I always tell him.
You have to engage.
You can't sit and wait for life to come.
You have to go get it.
Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today.
It's because you missed summer camp.
- I don't know how you're gonna learn.
- I'll work with her, she'll get it.
I guess we can put her in the back.
You know, you don't seem like the cheerleader type, Elena.
It's because her parents died.
Yeah, I mean, she's just totally going through a blah phase.
She used to be way more fun.
And I say that with complete sensitivity.
I'm sorry, Elena.
I know what it's like to lose both your parents.
In fact, Stefan and I have watched every single person we've ever cared about die.
We don't need to get into that right now.
Oh, you're right, Stef.
I'm sorry.
The last thing I wanted to do was bring her up.
Ha.
Mmm.
Don't do that.
Not while I'm working.
See you later.
She's my sister and I love her but sometimes she can really make you work for it.
I find it pretty easy.
All right, I get it.
Hit me to impress her.
That's real nice.
I don't need to impress her.
I already won.
Oh, now you're dead.
Am I? It seems I'm standing here waiting for you to man up.
Ty, don't.
- The next time I see you, Gilbert - No, next time I see you.
What are you doing, Vick? One more.
Mm.
Thank you.
Nice save.
I like you.
You know how to laugh.
And you make Stefan smile which is something I haven't seen in a very long time.
Earlier, did you mean Katherine? Mm-hm.
How did she die? In a fire.
Tragic fire.
Recently? It seems like it was yesterday.
What was she like? She was beautiful.
A lot like you in that department.
She was also very complicated and selfish, and at times not very kind but very sexy and seductive.
So which one of you dated her first? Nicely deduced.
Ask Stefan.
I'm sure his answer differs from mine.
I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.
- Why do you say that? - Oh, I saw you at practice.
You looked miserable.
- You saw that? - Am I wrong? I used to love it.
It was fun.
Things are different this year.
Everything that mattered doesn't anymore.
So don't let it.
Quit, move on.
Problem solved, ta-da.
Some things could matter again.
Maybe.
But it seems a little unrealistic to me.
I'm sorry.
About Katherine.
You lost her too.
Hey.
Need some help? Sure, why not? Matt tries, but he's just having a really hard time.
You have to understand that they were each other's first.
You know, like, from the sandbox.
- That's a really nice scarf.
- Mm.
- Thank you, it's new.
- Can I see it? I mean, would you mind taking it off? Oh, I can't.
Why not? You okay? Um All I know is that I can't take it off.
What are you two kids talking about? - I was just commenting on her scarf.
- Mm.
Hey, you know, uh, Elena and Bonnie are finishing up the dishes.
- Why don't you go see if you can help? - Does it look like I do dishes? Ha, ha.
For me? Mmm, I don't think so.
Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.
You know what? I'm gonna go see if Elena needs some help in the kitchen.
- Great.
They are people, Damon.
She's not a puppet.
She doesn't exist for your amusement for you to feed on whenever you want.
Sure she does.
They all do.
They're whatever I want them to be.
They're mine for the taking.
You've had your fun.
You used Caroline, you got to me and Elena, good for you.
Now it's time for you to go.
That's not a problem.
Because I've been invited in.
I'll come back tomorrow night and the following night and I'll do with your little cheerleader whatever I want to do.
Because that is what is normal to me.
- Tonight wasn't so bad.
I had fun.
- Mmm.
That makes one of us.
Come on.
Your brother isn't as bad as you make him out to be.
There must be a shred of humanity left inside my brother.
Somewhere.
I keep hoping.
But how do I make him see it? And how do I protect her? Just a couple of hours until kickoff, Timberwolves fans.
Don't forget Ooh.
Look at you.
You look hot in your jersey.
- What happened? No more cheerleader? - I quit.
I'm a quitter.
No.
Hey, you're not a quitter.
You suffered a great loss.
You're not the same person.
You should be looking ahead.
You should be starting over.
Okay? I hope you don't think this is too soon or too weird but I wanted you to have this.
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
It's something that I've had forever and I've never wanted to give it to anyone until now.
I'd very much like it if you'd wear it for me, for good luck.
- Is that rose that I smell? - No, it's a It's an herb.
- It's nice, huh? - I love it.
And I wanted to thank you for pushing me to try out for the team.
- It feels really good.
- We're a pair.
I quit, you start.
We're a, uh We're a work in progress.
We'll figure it out.
And you're not in uniform because? Quiet down for a minute.
Okay? Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.
Let's be honest here.
In the past, we used to let other teams come into our town and roll right over us.
But that is about to change.
We've got some great new talent tonight starting on offense and I'm gonna tell you right now, it has been a long time since I have seen a kid like this with hands like these.
Let's give it up for Stefan Salvatore.
This blows.
He can't start the guy.
He just got here.
That have been waiting for us to put a check in the win column I have only one thing to say to you, We're Timberwolves, we're hungry.
Hey, babe.
What's wrong? - Nothing.
- And the Central High Lions are what's for dinner.
- Is that Jeremy? Oh, no, Ty.
No.
Leave him alone.
What do you care? Don't look so down.
You can have her when I'm done.
- Unh! - Tyler, stop it.
Tyler! Stop, you're hurting him.
Tyler.
Tyler, stop.
Tyler.
Stop it! Hey, he's down.
Enough.
Jeremy, no.
- Tyler, knock it off.
- Get off me.
- Stop.
- What the hell, Jeremy? - Put your head up, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, you smell fine.
- Just stop, okay? Come on, man.
Come on.
Oh, my God, your hand.
No, no, no, it's fine.
Is it deep? How bad is it? Come on.
- But I saw it, it was - He missed.
It's not my blood.
See? I'm fine.
No, no, no, I saw it.
- The glass cut your hand - It's okay.
I'm okay.
It's almost kickoff time, all right? So I'll see you after the game.
Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly.
Can you stand straight, please? Could someone please help Tiki? - Any? No? - Hey, where you been? Can I ask you a question? And you give me a really serious no-joke response? - Of course.
What is it? - The bad mojo.
When you touched Stefan and you had that reaction Forget I said that.
Your dinner-party plot won me over.
No, Bonnie, seriously.
What was it? Did you see something, or? It wasn't clear like a picture.
Like today, I keep seeing those same numbers I told you about eight, 14, 22.
- Yeah? - When I touched Stefan, it was a feeling.
And it vibrated through me, and it was cold, and And what? It was death.
It's what I imagine death to be like.
You scared me.
What are you doing here? I'm hiding from Caroline.
- And why is that? - I needed a break.
She talks more than I can listen.
That could be a sign.
- Well, she's awfully young.
- Not much younger than you are.
Yeah.
I don't see it going anywhere in the bigger picture.
I think she'd drive me crazy.
Caroline does have annoying traits but we've been friends since first grade and that means something to me.
Duly noted.
I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable.
That's not my intention.
Yes, it is.
Otherwise, you wouldn't put an alternate meaning behind everything you say.
You're right.
I do have other intentions, but so do you.
- Really? - Mm-hm.
I see them.
You want me.
- Excuse me? - I get to you.
You find yourself drawn to me.
You think about me when you don't wanna.
I bet you've dreamed about me.
And right now, you wanna kiss me.
What the hell? I don't know what game you're trying to play with Stefan, but I don't wanna be part of it.
I don't know what happened in the past but let's get one thing straight, I am not Katherine.
You gonna be able to play? Oh, yeah, I'm good.
Uh, what you did back there.
You had Jeremy's back.
He's a messed-up kid.
- Somebody's gotta look out for him.
- I know.
This week at practice I was a dick.
- Had your reasons.
- No excuse.
Good luck tonight.
We're lucky to have you.
Isn't that nice? Stefan joins a team, makes a friend.
It's all so, "Rah, rah, go team, yeah.
" Not tonight.
I'm done with you.
Nice trick with Elena.
Let me guess.
Vervain in the necklace.
I admit, I was a bit surprised.
It's been a while since anyone could resist my compulsion.
Where'd you get it? - Does it matter? - Guess I could just seduce her the old-fashioned way.
Or I could just eat her.
- No.
You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.
- No? Because deep down inside, there is a part of you that feels for her.
I was worried that you had no humanity left inside of you that you may have actually become the monster that you pretend to be.
- Who's pretending? - Then kill me.
- Well, I'm tempted.
- No, you're not.
You've had lifetimes to do it, and yet, here I am.
I'm still alive.
And there you are.
You're still haunting me.
After 145 years.
Katherine is dead.
And you hate me because you loved her, and you torture me because you still do.
And that, my brother, that is your humanity.
Salvatore.
What the hell? We've got a game to play.
If that's my humanity then what's this? No! Anyone, any time, any place.
Tanner's MIA.
I think he had a bit too much beer - Don't talk to me.
I'm pissed at you.
- What's your problem? You're my problem, all right? You're a bully.
A freaking 12-year-old bully, man.
I'm sick of it.
What was that about tonight? What's beating up the new guy gonna prove? Or screwing with my sister or pummeling my girlfriend's brother.
Girlfriend? I don't know how to tell you but she dumped your ass.
Are you for real? - You wanna hit me? I'm on your team.
- This was over the line.
Even for you.
Somebody help! It wasn't just for the drugs.
What kind of animal could be doing all this? Why would it come out of the woods and attack someone in the middle of town? I don't know.
I don't know.
I was so sure that you cut your hand.
- I saw it.
- I'm fine.
I'm fine, okay? We're fine.
That's what matters.
I thought there was hope.
That somewhere deep inside something in Damon was still human, normal.
But I was wrong.
There's nothing human left in Damon.
No good, no kindness, no love.
Only a monster who must be stopped.
