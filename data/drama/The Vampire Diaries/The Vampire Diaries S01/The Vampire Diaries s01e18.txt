Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
- Where is he? - They have him.
Who says we're not here for revenge, right? That's what we're here for.
Can you make it? Take my wrist.
You need blood.
Stefan.
Stefan, he's dead.
- You were like this other person.
- Everything's gonna be okay.
They found Vicki Donovan.
The storm unearthed the grave.
- She's dead? - Matt.
Who am I to make you Could you turn it up a little bit? It's not annoying yet.
Sorry.
A whole lotta you and When you going back to school? - Soon.
- Oh, come on, just drink already.
Come on.
This self-detox, it's not natural.
Get that away from me, please? How long did it take to wean yourself off of it after you last indulged? - That's not good.
- I'll be fine.
It takes a bit of time.
You don't have to kill to survive.
That's what blood banks are for.
I haven't hunted a human in - God, way too long.
- Oh, I'm impressed.
It's completely self-serving.
Trying to get the town off the trail of vampires, which is not easy considering there's an entire tomb of them around.
What are we doing about that? We're not gonna be doing much of anything if you don't have your strength.
There's nothing wrong with a healthy diet of human blood from a blood bank.
- You're not killing anyone.
- I have my reasons.
What are those holier-than-thou reasons? We've never actually discussed that.
- You know, I'd love to hear this story.
- You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Just watching me struggle? - Very much so.
- I hate to break it to you, Damon but I actually have it under complete control.
- You do? - Mm-hm.
Oh.
Well, then you should just carry on making the rest of us vampires look bad.
Have a great day, Stef.
Oh.
Hey.
Almost forgot something.
Oops.
Mm.
Mm.
Come on, Jeremy, I'm going to school.
- Walking out the door now.
- You forgot this.
Thank you.
- Elena.
- Uncle John.
Hi.
- Jenna.
- John.
You made it.
I said I'd be in by noon.
What you say and what you do are typically two very different things.
- Uncle John, what's up? - Hey.
I had some business in town.
I thought a visit was in order.
- How long are you staying? - I don't know yet.
Okay, well, I'm gonna go school.
I'll see you later.
So, what's up with Jeremy? He just lost a friend, so try to be sensitive.
- I'm always sensitive.
- Right.
So really, how long are you staying? Can't you at least pretend that you're happy to see me? Oh, my God, John, it is so good to see you.
How have you been? No, I can't.
Did you think I was gonna sign the escrow papers and send them back? - Actually, I did.
- I'm not gonna let you sell.
It's not up to you or me.
It belongs to Jeremy and Elena.
But they're minors.
So I get final say, being that I'm the estate's trustee.
- He said his trip is open-ended.
- Uncle John.
I never really liked that guy.
Does anyone? - I am here for moral support if you need.
- Thanks.
I think I'll suffer this one alone.
You've been through enough.
Thank you, by the way, for just For everything you did at Vicki's funeral and her memorial.
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- Of course, Matt.
So is Caroline still baking for you guys around the clock? She finally went to her dad's, which is a good thing because my mom was gonna strangle her if she dropped off more lasagna.
Oh.
Hm.
I've hit the hard times I'm off course The winds have changed No.
- What's your problem? - I just don't want any.
All right.
They say she OD'd.
That's what I don't get.
She was doing okay.
Apparently not.
How'd she end up in the woods? I don't understand.
By whoever was with her when she OD'd.
You leave her.
You don't take time to bury her.
Maybe she saw something and Hell, man, I don't know.
Right this way.
The coroner's office has officially ruled Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose.
Her family has been notified.
The truth will stay in this room and we can put this behind us.
Thank you, sheriff.
And on to a more pressing issue.
John Gilbert has asked to say few words.
- Welcome back, John.
Good to see you.
- Thank you, mayor.
Hello, everyone.
It's wonderful to see you.
I wish it were under better circumstances.
As a founding family member, it's my duty to report some distressing news.
He's a Gilbert? Elena's uncle.
His name is John.
I call him jackass.
A hospital blood bank in the county of Amherst has reported several break-ins the past two weeks.
Seven hunters, four campers and two state employees have been reported missing.
All of this within a 75-mile radius of Mystic Falls.
Okay, okay, no need to get alarmed right at this moment.
He doesn't wanna cancel the Founder's Day party.
You think all of your problems are over but I'm here to tell you, nothing's been solved.
I made a copy of a paper that Jeremy wrote for me.
I think you should take a look at it.
Jeremy wrote this? He was very clear that he didn't think it was real.
I really hope you're right, because I have done so much to protect him from all this.
So how do you deal with it? What do you mean? With all the lies and the secrets.
You have to lie to everyone who's important to you.
It's not safe for them to know the truth.
So, yes, I keep it from them, but it's only because I love them.
I think Stefan's a good guy but at the end of the day, he's still a vampire.
I know it's hard to understand, but Stefan's different.
He would never do anything to hurt me.
I have no interest in the Founder's Day kickoff party.
- Sure you do.
It's tradition.
- Far be it to break from tradition.
Gilberts have been a part of this town for a hundred and fifty years.
One of the founding families.
And with that distinction come certain obligations including going to the party.
One day, when you can appreciate the significance l'll tell you all about your heritage.
Hm.
The Gilbert family legacy.
I forgot how sacred it was.
I'm not a Gilbert, so I was never cool enough to hear it.
- Why does she hate you? - We used to sleep together.
- Ha! - I am standing right here.
Why would he write a report on vampires? - Do you think he's starting to remember? - Damon took away those memories.
You don't have to worry about that.
Tell you what, why don't you just ask him? - I I can't.
- Why not? I mean, if he doesn't know anything, then it's just a An innocent question.
I don't even know how to talk to him anymore.
I mean, we used to be a lot more open with each other.
But now, with all these secrets just piling up You know, I haven't even told him that I'm adopted yet.
Maybe it's time you start opening up to him again.
I'm not saying you should tell everything, but try to find out what he does know and be prepared for it.
- What about you? How are you doing? - I'm much, much better.
You know, I'm still, you know, a little A little jittery, a little bit on edge but I'm gonna be okay.
I've been really worried about you.
And I've missed you.
I just needed to lay low for a little while and let my body readjust.
It's only been a few days.
It feels like a lifetime.
I've missed you too.
Stefan, what's wrong? Stefan.
- Oh, good.
You're here.
- You ask, I come.
I'm easy like that.
No, Elena, I will not go to your bedroom with you.
- Ah.
Just like I remembered.
- Stop messing around.
Did you know that your uncle's been kicking it with the Founder's Council? - What? - Yep.
Perfect.
We'll just add it to growing list of how everything is falling apart.
What happened right there? Nothing.
Look, Damon, I'm worried about Stefan.
He says everything is okay, but he's clearly struggling.
- How long before he's back to normal? - A few days, give or take.
- It's been a few days.
- Give, then.
I don't know.
What's the big deal? He's not himself, Damon.
Well, maybe his problem is he's spent too long not being himself.
Hm.
Please don't make me sorry for asking you.
- It is what it is, Elena.
- Hey.
The Stefan you know was good-behavior Stefan.
Rein-it-in Stefan.
Fight-against-his-nature to-an-annoyingly-obsessive-level Stefan.
If you think there's not another part to this, then you have not been paying attention.
- He is not you.
Not even close.
- Well, he doesn't wanna be me.
But that doesn't mean that deep down that he's not.
Mm-hm.
- Hey.
- What's up? Do you have some time to talk? Uh - Yeah, sure.
- Not here.
Come on.
Let's get out of the house.
I just can't believe Mom and Dad never told you that you were adopted.
I'm sure they would've eventually.
Why were you worried about what I thought? Because I don't know, it's weird.
Going your whole life thinking you're related by blood to someone.
- Does it bug you that we're not? - No.
Jer, you're my brother.
That's all that matters.
So Mr.
Saltzman said you've been doing great in history now.
Yeah, yeah.
He's really been helping me out.
Yeah, he gave me some extra credit and stuff.
He loved your vampire paper.
He thought I had a clever angle.
What drew you to that subject matter? I don't know.
Boredom.
Or maybe I'm just as nuts as the long line of Gilbert crazies.
- The Gilberts aren't crazy.
- Easy for you to say.
You're not one.
Ouch.
Oh, God.
I shouldn't be here.
Come on.
Don't be a downer.
It's a party for founding families.
That would be us.
It would be rude to skip it.
I really liked you a whole lot better when you hated everybody.
Oh, I still do.
I just love that they love me.
- How you feeling? - I'm good.
I'm fine.
No cravings, no urges? Is that whiskey you've been drinking all day doing its job? We are who we are, Stefan.
Pretending doesn't change that.
Nothing would make you happier than to see me give in, huh, Damon? Whatever.
It's inevitable.
- I'm gonna go find Elena.
- Don't embarrass me, young man.
Here you go, miss.
I'm so glad you can join us tonight.
- It was nice of you to reach out to us.
- This town is one big family.
When we lose a member, we all have to come together.
- Matt.
- Mayor.
Kelly.
Well, I guess dead kid rates a special greeting from the mayor, huh? God, Mom.
I need a drink.
Hey.
Check it out.
Your dad is gonna beat you if he catches you.
Yeah, let him try.
All right, screw it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How are you? Are you drunk? Okay, I know it's a little weird, but it's really helping me.
Alcohol, it takes the edge off.
You're totally that drunk high-school guy at the party sneaking booze.
- I totally am.
Yeah.
- How worried do I need to be? Oh, no.
You don't need to be worried.
It's just until the cravings go away.
Listen, I think we should enjoy it while it lasts.
Would you like to dance with me? You hate dancing.
I usually have to beg you.
No, you have to beg the sober me.
The drunk me, there's no begging necessary.
- Nice to see you again.
- There's really no one dancing.
That's because they need something better to dance to.
Be right back.
Yeah, that's not gonna work.
I tried to bribe the guy with 20 bucks and a date.
He said Carol Lockwood has complete control over the music choices.
You'd be surprised what Stefan can accomplish when he puts his mind to it.
Thank God.
Counting all different ideas drifting away Have I entered an alternate universe where Stefan is fun? Is he gonna be okay? - Yeah.
- Eventually.
One way or another.
- Way too complicated For a minute thought I couldn't tell How to fall out I got a problem and it drains my soul Don't tell, nobody knows History teacher, 3 o'clock.
- How do I look? - Beautiful.
- I've been looking for you.
- Here I am.
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- Yeah, well things have been a little crazy.
But I'm here now.
Do you wanna get a drink? - Sure.
- Okay.
Great.
When did this happen? DJ had a change of heart.
- You wanna dance? - I don't know.
- Yes, yes.
- Matt.
Matt.
Ugh.
Come on.
I got a problem and it drains my soul I love a woman in uniform, but I have to side with this look.
You look You look smashing.
Thank you, Damon.
Cheers.
I needed that.
You know, I had my doubts about you at first.
But like everyone else on the council, you've won me over.
Thanks, Liz.
It's really nice how welcoming the council's been.
I like my life here in Mystic Falls.
It's starting to feel like home again.
You're not gonna like what I have to tell.
Jonathan Gilbert's claims check out.
The blood banks, the missing people, all of it's true.
- We might have a problem.
- Excuse me, sheriff.
Um I was curious if there's been any more information on Vicki Donovan.
It was an overdose, Jeremy.
Yeah, but her body was buried.
Somebody must've done that.
We're aware of that.
The investigation is ongoing.
But there's nothing more I can tell you at this time.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
I don't wanna lose your love tonight Please dance with your alcoholic vampire boyfriend.
- To be found They all split when I'm in trouble - Whoa.
Watch it.
- I'm sorry.
My fault.
I'm clumsy.
- Heh, heh.
Then get off the dance floor.
- Excuse me.
- That's no way to talk to a lady.
- Whatever.
I think you need to apologize.
I'm sorry.
Now say it like you mean it.
I'm really, really sorry.
- Stefan, it's fine.
- Now walk away.
You all right? Well, go get your shovel - Bourbon.
- Thank you.
- You noticed what your brother's up to? - No.
I've been preoccupied with yours.
Jeremy's been asking about Vicki Donovan's death.
He knows her death was ruled an overdose.
Really? Oh, but, sheriff, someone buried her.
Who would do that? I know.
I know.
Me.
I mean, I could compel him, but he's wearing vervain.
- I don't want you to compel him.
- Lf he keeps asking questions Damon, no, I'm serious.
I'm not gonna do that to him again.
I'll handle it.
Okay.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Her prince finally came to save her And the rest you can figure out But it was a trick And the clock struck I saw that.
Shh.
We'll keep that between you and me.
Where's the ladies' room? - This way.
I'll show you.
- Is that soda? Um Vodka, thank God.
Well, go get your shovel And we'll dig Damon, right? - John.
- We didn't get to meet at the meeting.
Yeah, it's a pleasure.
- Are you enjoying the kickoff? - Oh, yeah.
I forgot how much fun these can be.
Yeah, yeah.
When is the last time you were here? It hasn't been that long.
My brother's funeral.
- How long have you been in town? - Not long at all.
So what do you think, Damon? You know this vampire problem is real, right? - It's a potential bloodbath.
- I wouldn't overreact, John.
Oh, I think it's like 1864 all over again.
Vampires running amuck.
We're gonna have to hunt them down, throw them in church burn them to ash.
That is the story, huh? Part of the story, yeah.
- Oh, there's more? - Oh, there's a lot more.
You see, it seems there was a tomb under the church where the vampires were hidden away waiting for someone to set them free.
But then you already knew that, didn't you? Being that you're the one that did it.
And you're telling me this, why? Get the introductions out of the way.
Look, well, you know that I could rip your throat before anyone would notice.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
- But you probably ingest vervain, so - Why don't you take a bite, find out? It's not worth my time.
Jer.
L I heard about your conversation with Sheriff Forbes.
No one is trying to figure out what happened.
They're willing to believe she OD'd.
The office confirmed it.
If that's what happened Is that what you believe? What do you think happened? I think somebody killed her and buried her body.
I don't think we write it off because it's easy.
They're doing what they can.
Truth is the only thing that's gonna help people.
Jer, just let it go, okay? Whatever it was, she's gone now.
Whatever it was? So you don't think it was an overdose.
Yes, I do.
Is there something you're not telling me? - Why aren't you looking at me? - Stop it.
That didn't mean anything.
If there was something else, you would tell me, right? Of course I would.
Oh, God, I can't even walk.
- I know.
Me neither.
- Oh, God, Matt's gonna kill me.
He won't even notice.
I think he's actually letting himself have some fun for once.
I'm supposed to be on my best behavior because of Vicki but I don't wanna think about it.
I can't, because if I do Yeah, I was a dick to her.
I was really bad.
That's what I hate, is I can't make any of it right.
It's like I don't deserve to even miss her.
Um You're nice to talk to me.
I don't have anyone to talk to.
I don't have anyone to talk to either.
Who knew I'd been missing all the fun? This is rare, believe me.
Is it bad that I'm enjoying myself? No, it's great that you're enjoying yourself.
- Thanks for making me dance.
- Yeah, no problem.
Waitin' on a cold day Air.
Air.
I need some air.
Come with me? - Sure.
- You haven't seen my mom, have you? Um No, not in a while.
All right.
We're the wild type Oh, my God.
- What are you doing? - Matt - Mom.
- Whoa, dude, calm down, man.
- Matt! - No! Stop it.
Tyler.
Stop it, you're hurting him.
Somebody help us.
Stop.
Tyler.
Hey, stop.
All right, stop.
What the hell was that? Huh? Here, come on.
Get up.
Are you okay? What was that? I'll take it from here.
I'll take it from here.
It's all right.
It's okay.
You hurt? Okay.
Go get cleaned up.
It's okay.
Go get cleaned up.
Thank you for your help.
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
Back to the party.
Let's go.
Come on, have a good time.
- Are you okay? - Where is she? I don't know.
Come on, put your head up.
Do you wanna hear the bad news or the really bad news? Actually I don't want any news, Damon.
All right, let me rephrase.
Do you wanna hear how the council's back in vampire mode or how I just killed Uncle John Gilbert? - What? - Great party, by the way, huh? [OVER SPEAKERS.]
Your words so dry Your face so wet Damon.
Is everything all right? No.
I ruined it.
I always ruin it.
What is wrong with me? What are you doing? Alone, alone, alone And my heart sinks like a stone A stone I'm sorry.
I feel so numb All right.
Well No, not a guest to be seen You've gotta be kidding me.
Thank you all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you all for joining us tonight.
In a few moments, we will officially begin the countdown to our Founder's Day celebration.
And it's a very special one this year.
The 150th birthday of our town.
And And I would like to welcome back one of our town's favorite sons to do the honors of ringing our official charter bell.
John Gilbert, would you please join me up here? One hundred and fifty years of community, prosperity, family.
We take care of each other.
We look after each other.
We protect each other.
It's good to be home.
- Look at his right hand.
- Whose? The town's favorite son.
Look at his ring.
- Well, looks like mine.
- Yeah, and that'd be a big coincidence if he didn't just come back from the dead five minutes ago.
- Where the hell did you get that ring? - Isobel, my wife.
Who gave birth to Elena under the medical care of the esteemed Dr.
Grayson Gilbert John's brother.
You think John knew Isobel? I think John knows a lot of things.
- Take care.
- Have a good night.
Well, when's the last time you were? Sorry about that, man.
I really am terribly sorry.
You don't wanna do this, man.
Sorry about that too.
God, all I can do is apologize.
What's that about? Get out of my way, please.
No girl to show off for now? I see how this is.
What are you, man? Stefan? Stefan? Hey.
Hey, are you okay? What happened? My arm.
I lost my balance and fell.
I'm clumsy.
Good to see you guys.
- Let's go.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
I don't even know what happened.
I was drinking and I lost control.
I can't explain it.
That is the last time you ever embarrass this family.
- What are you doing? Matt, don't.
- I can't do it anymore, Mom.
Just go, all right? You've done it before, more times than I can count.
I'm not leaving you.
- Matty.
- Mom! Don't you get it? I'm better off without you.
No.
Tonight was God, I'm so sorry.
I know I've failed you.
And I failed Vicki.
But I won't do it to you again.
I promise I'll get it together.
I want you out of the house and my life by morning.
Going somewhere, huh? I never like to be the last one to leave a party.
It's too desperate.
Are you here to kill me or are you gonna let Mr.
Saltzman? - Okay, you obviously know who I am.
- I do.
Alaric Saltzman, the high school history teacher with a secret.
Sure know a lot for someone who just got to town.
More than you can imagine, Damon.
My knowledge of this town goes beyond anything that you or you or the council knows.
So if you were planning on some clever high-speed-snatch-ring-vamp-kill move know that if I die everything I know goes to the council including a fascinating little tale of the original Salvatore brothers and their present-day return to Mystic Falls.
How'd you get that ring? I inherited one.
My brother Gray, the other.
This was his.
And I wouldn't have given mine to Isobel had I known she'd hand it to a guy.
- You know her.
Who sent her your way when she wanted to become a vampire? - You sent her? - Guilty.
Why, did you think someone else sent her? Maybe Katherine Pierce? - How do you know about Katherine? - How do I know anything? What do you want? So many questions.
It's a pleasure meeting you, Ric.
I've heard so much about you.
I'm not so excited that we have another month of these Founder's Day events.
Tell me about it.
- You okay? - Fine.
- Are you sure? - I'm fine, Elena.
- Oh, my God, you scared me.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry that I ran off earlier.
What happened? Is everything okay? No.
Talk to me.
Stefan, tell me.
I tried so hard to keep it together tonight.
And it was working.
It was working, but But then Matt's mom, she got hurt and she was bleeding.
And I had her blood on my hands.
- And then what happened? - And then l That guy in the parking lot, I wanted to feed on him.
It took everything inside of me not to do it.
- But you didn't? - No, but I wanted to.
Oh, God.
Elena, l My head is pounding.
I feel like my skin is on Is on fire.
I have this hunger inside of me that I've never I've never felt before in my entire life.
All I keep thinking is how I promised I would never keep anything from you.
- And so I'm telling you this.
- It's okay.
I need you to tell me things.
But I don't want you to see me like this.
I don't want you to know that this side of me exists.
Stefan, you're gonna get through this.
I'm gonna help you.
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.
I can't, l I'm afraid of what I could do to you.
I'm not.
Stefan.
Stefan, I'm not.
I'm not, okay? I love you so much.
Oh, I love you too.
We have a problem, Stefan.
And when I say problem, I mean global crisis.
It seems Uncle John has You don't look so good.
It's different this time, isn't it? The need is too strong.
Of course it would be after all these years.
Have a good night, brother.
