Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
There's a tomb underneath the church.
A spell sealed Katherine in that tomb.
I'm gonna bring her back.
- She's not here! - You saved everyone in the church? We've taken up residence just outside of town.
- All 25 vampires? - Some.
I hate this house.
I didn't stay locked up for 145 years to end up locked up here.
- Where's Bethanne? - She won't be back.
My wife, Isobel, has spent her life researching paranormal activity.
- What have you done? - I turned her.
Maybe there is such a thing as vampires, different from the way we thought.
Agh! You got a problem with blood, Anna? I knew this girl, Vicki.
She was attacked, a bite to the neck.
- Then I saw your face.
- Why would you confront me about it? Maybe it's true about Vicki.
And also because I want you to turn me.
I love storms.
Is that a vampire thing? I read vampires don't like running water.
That's only Dracula.
Yeah, he was a complete wuss.
Never showered.
Very smelly.
- Seriously? - Ha, ha.
Don't believe anything you read.
You gotta tell me more, I gotta know.
No, you don't.
- You're not gonna be one.
- You can't keep saying no.
I'm not gonna turn someone who learned everything about vampires from Netflix.
That's not true and you know it.
Why do you even want this? Give me one good reason.
Because I Let me know when you can finish that sentence.
- Hey, you're still up.
- Hey, what's up? Looks like there's a big storm rolling in.
Can you make sure the windows are closed? Yeah, yeah.
Sure.
We're running low on blood.
You might wanna send Anna to the hospital for some more.
I'll send her out for some tomorrow.
Maybe I could go with her.
If the storm keeps it dark enough, I might be able to go out.
- No sun and all.
- I'm afraid not.
Not after your stunt at the Salvatore house tonight.
- He and his brother deserved it.
- What did that get you? Your girlfriend, Bethanne, is dead.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
We cannot live our lives about revenge.
We have to have better control of our emotions.
I understand, Miss Pearl.
I just wish I knew what you were up to.
I'm gonna make an exploratory visit into town tomorrow to assess who's under the influence of vervain and who isn't.
Anna tells me that the players haven't changed much.
It's still the Lockwoods, Forbes, the Fells - We should kill every last one of them.
- We are smarter than that, Frederick.
These people are not our enemies.
We don't hold grudges and resentments.
We'll get our town back.
We just have to have patience.
You heard her.
No revenge.
Patience.
Self-control.
She seems to have it all figured out, doesn't she? I say we go to Pearl's and annihilate the idiot that attacked us last night.
Yeah? And then what, turn to the rest of their house of vampires and say, oops, sorry? I can't believe you made a deal with her.
It's more like a helpful exchange of information.
It's not like I got a choice.
She's scary.
Besides, she's gonna help me get Katherine back.
Of course she is.
Damon gets what he wants, as usual, no matter who he hurts.
You don't have to be snarky about it.
I woke up to learn that all the vampires have been released from the tomb.
- I've earned snarky.
- Ugh.
How long are you gonna blame me for turning your birth mother into a vampire? I'm not blaming you.
I've accepted the fact you're a psychopath with no redeeming qualities.
Ouch.
This isn't being productive.
We're gonna figure out a way to deal with Pearl and the vampires, yeah? I'm sorry, he just makes me so cranky.
- I know, he makes everybody cranky.
- So, what are we gonna do? Damon and I are gonna handle everything.
What about me? I can't sit here and do nothing.
That's what you're gonna do.
That's what's gonna keep you safe.
Which means nothing if you're not safe too.
I'm perfectly safe.
I have Damon, the self-serving psychopath, on my side.
Ugh.
Well, that's comforting.
Okay, we have some time.
I'm not meeting my mom until later.
Does your mom know you're? The fact that you think it's possible to keep that a secret from your own family is proof that you're not ready.
Not ready is a step up from no.
And a million steps down from maybe.
- I like your bracelet.
- Thanks, my, uh, sister got it for me.
- Can I see it? - Yeah, yeah.
Hmm.
She doesn't know you're hanging out with me? No, but I don't see why it would be a problem.
It's not like she knows what you are.
I'd rather keep it our little secret.
You know, why don't you, um? Why don't you keep this? - Why would you give this to me? - Because you like it.
And I like you.
You only like me because of what you want from me.
No.
L Heh, I like you.
Um You know, you should wear it.
It looks better on you anyway.
I yelled at my mom last night.
I feel like the parent yelling at the screwed-up kid.
She needed to hear it.
Yeah, but I worry if I pushed too hard, then she'll take off again.
That's her M.
O.
, just like Vicki who I haven't heard from since she left.
You can't control your mom, Matt, any more than you can control your sister.
I wish that she would just try a little, you know? If she would try to try, that would be okay.
Maybe she'll surprise you.
People have a tendency to do that.
I should go before the roads get even worse from the storm.
Are you sure you should be driving? Ugh.
I have to.
It's my Dad's boyfriend's daughter's birthday.
We have a nontraditional traditional ritual.
Well, buckle up.
Don't speed.
Stay off your cell phone and call me when you get there.
Got it.
- Anything else? - Yes.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hunting party? Guy did a number on me last night.
I gotta get my strength back.
I have two liters of soccer mom in the fridge.
No? - We'll talk when I get back.
- Give my regards to the squirrels.
You're ignoring me.
The six missed calls? Sorry, my phone's dead.
- Is Stefan here? - No.
- Why? Is something wrong? - He went out and didn't come back.
I can't get him on his phone, I figured he was here with you.
It's going straight to voicemail.
Where could he be? You're not gonna like what I'm thinking.
Pearl, open this door.
I swear to God, I'll bust through it and rip your head off.
Pearl's not home.
Mm.
Beautiful weather.
Not a ray of sun in the sky.
Where's my brother? Billy.
You're dead.
Whoa.
I'm sorry, but you haven't been invited in.
- Miss Gibbons? - Yes, Frederick, honey? Never let this bad man in.
I'll never let him in.
- Ugh! - One-hundred and forty-five years left starving in a tomb thanks to Katherine's infatuation with you and your brother.
The first few weeks every single nerve in your body screams with fire.
The kind of pain that can drive a person mad.
Well, I thought your brother might wanna get a taste of that before I killed him.
Billy? - Unh.
- You have a nice day.
What happened? Where is he? - They have him, I can't get in.
- Why not? Woman who owns the house's was compelled to not let me in.
- I can get in.
- You're not.
- I'm going.
- You're not going in there.
Why are they doing this? What do they want with him? Revenge.
They want revenge.
- We've got to do something.
- I know.
- We've got to get him out.
- I know.
Elena, I know.
But I don't know how to get him out.
Vervain on the ropes.
That's gotta sting.
Speaking of This isn't right.
He killed Bethanne.
One of us, Harper.
And don't you think for a second he wouldn't kill you if he had the chance.
Pearl says we're not here for revenge, right? I say that's exactly what we're here for.
Starting with this.
And then his brother.
And anyone else that's gets in our way.
- This isn't right.
- You're gonna wanna let go of me.
- Miss Pearl will be home soon.
- Miss Pearl is no longer in charge.
Noah, tie him up.
Stake him down.
Well, you look alive.
You can't hurt me.
Oh, I can hurt you all right.
Mr.
Saltzman.
We need your help.
Stefan's in the house.
Damon's a vampire.
He can't get in.
We need you.
- I would go, but - But your life is valuable.
- Yours, on the other hand, is - Stefan told me about your ring.
- What about it? - Let me recap.
You tried to kill me, I defended myself, you died.
Then according to my brother, your ring brought you back to life.
Am I, uh, leaving anything out? Yeah, the part where I try and kill you again.
Only this time I don't miss.
Mr.
Saltzman.
Please.
- It's Stefan.
- I'm sorry, Elena.
- It's not my problem.
- That's a shame.
Because the woman in charge of the crowd can help you find your wife.
- You're lying.
- Am I? Why don't you ask her for yourself? Coward.
Come on, Elena.
All right.
Wait.
I'll go.
So I have an answer.
- To what? - Why you should turn me.
We're back to that? Look, I wake up every day and I feel okay but there's something missing.
Like a Like a hole.
Some people, they fit, in life or whatever.
I don't.
So you want a pity turn? I don't think so.
You should turn me because I don't have anything else.
Do you even know why we turn other people? It's not to give someone a one-way ticket out of loner-hood.
One, we need someone to do our dirty work.
Two, revenge.
Three, boredom, but, you know, that never turns out well.
And then, you know, there's the obvious one.
That you love someone so much that you would do anything to spend all eternity with them.
Ahem.
I'm sorry, but you don't fit any of those categories yet.
So, yeah, just make sure your thesis is clear, and she'll love it.
I'll see you later.
- Mom, hey.
- Did you get everything? Yeah, the, uh, blood bank was understaffed because of the rain.
I was in and out.
- Who's that you were talking to? - A friend.
Let's get home.
You're not going out in that, are you? The roads are dangerous.
Route 5 is completely flooded.
We'll make do.
- Mayor Lockwood, we have your table.
- Great.
Mayor Lockwood, is it? I suppose it is treacherous outside.
- My name is Pearl.
- Hi.
This is my daughter, Anna.
- We've just recently moved to town.
- Welcome.
Richard Lockwood.
This is my son, Tyler.
Please, please join us.
It would be a pleasure.
Be more creepy, dad.
Not like your son is standing right here.
Grow up, elections are coming.
She's a constituent, and a rich one from the looks of it.
And you can tell all that by looking at her ass? Awesome.
I'm gonna go shoot some pool.
Teacher by day, vampire hunter by night.
- I have you to thank for that.
- What are these? Tranquilizer darts filled with vervain.
- Just get me in and I'll get Stefan out.
- That's your plan? Just take them all on yourself? I'll be a little stealthier than that, hopefully.
- Whoa.
What are you doing? - I'm going with you.
- No, no, no, no way.
- You need me.
I'll get in, you can distract them, then I'll get Stefan out.
- You'll get yourself killed.
- I'm going.
So when you get me in, get out as quickly as you can.
Because I know how to sneak around.
- You'll basically just be in the way.
- Not the time to be the Lone Ranger.
Fine, Elena, you can drive the getaway car.
- You're not going in the house.
- You can't stop me.
It's Stefan we're talking about here.
- You don't understand.
- Oh, I understand, I understand.
He's the reason you live.
His love lifts you up where you belong.
I get it.
Can you just not joke around? I can't protect you, Elena.
I don't know how many vampires are in there.
That's how long it takes to get your head ripped off.
I have to get in and get out.
I can't be distracted with your safety.
Or this will end up a bloodbath that none of us walk away from including Stefan.
I know.
I get it.
I understand.
If we're gonna go, let's go.
Where are you? I can barely hear you.
Storm washed out Route 5.
Now I'm detoured on some random backwoods path to hell.
You shouldn't be talking while you're driving.
I know, right.
I need one of those Bluetooth thingies.
Look, you're breaking up.
Just turn around and go back the same way you came.
And watch the road, okay? Okay.
Gah.
Ugh, seriously.
Ah, good.
Someone's home.
Uh Can I use your phone? My car broke down a few miles up the road and this is the first house I saw.
- Well, lucky you.
- Yeah, lucky me.
Ha.
- It's no trouble, is it? - Not the slightest.
Great.
Whoo.
I really appreciate it.
It's, uh, it's rough out there.
Billy, show our visitor where the phone is in the kitchen.
- And get me something to drink.
- Yeah, sure thing.
Hey, Miss Gibbons.
He's gonna use your phone.
Oh, sure, honey.
It's right there.
Thanks.
- What's happening? - You need to invite a friend of mine in.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's not allowed in the house.
- You have to make an exception - Get her out of the house, now.
Miss Gibbons, tell me the truth.
- Are you married? - No.
Parents, children? Anyone else who lives on this property? - No, it's just me.
- No? Good.
- You were to compel her.
- Doesn't work that way.
- She's human.
- And I'm not.
So I don't care.
Now get out of here.
And get rid of the body.
I'm in the process of obtaining some property.
I understand that your family is the largest property owner in town.
Why, yes, we are.
Dating all the way back to the town's original charter.
Your family came into a lot of new property in 1864.
You know your history.
It's a passion of mine.
Guy's not even subtle about it.
Who is that? It's not my mother.
I'm sorry, mayor.
Do you know that boy over there? Yeah, it's Jeremy Gilbert.
You don't say.
Billy, what's the hold up? Damn it, Elena.
Billy, Jacob, get back in here.
Are you insane? Jeremy Gilbert? Is that what you've been up to? He's my friend.
What's the big deal? His family is the reason I was stuck in a tomb for over a century.
That doesn't mean he'll make the same choices.
I want you to stop seeing him.
I've been on my own for a long time.
I can make my own decisions.
Then stop acting like a child.
As soon as Jeremy finds out what you really are, he will turn on He already knows.
What did you just say? Jeremy knows.
He likes it and he likes me.
Thank you for trying to help me.
They just needed somebody to blame.
Someone to punish.
Elena.
- You shouldn't be here.
- She was supposed to stay in the car.
- Ugh! - No, no.
Not him.
Whatever, let's get you down.
There's vervain on the ropes.
Elena, pull that.
All right, let's go.
- Clothes on.
- Wait.
What? Guys, come on, we have to get out of here.
- Come on, we gotta go.
- The other one.
Hey, come on.
- Can you get him in the car? - Yeah.
- All right, go.
- What about you? You rescue, I'll distract.
Go.
Turn that down.
It's too quiet.
- Spread out, now.
- All right.
Come on.
You two, back of the house.
Go.
Check out both rooms.
Cellar, now.
Can you make it? - You okay? - Yeah.
We gotta keep going.
Come on.
I'm going after Frederick.
It's right over here.
Okay.
Stefan - This is for Bethanne.
- Ugh! - And this is for the tomb.
- No! Stefan.
Stefan.
Stefan.
No, Stefan.
Stefan? Stefan.
Stefan.
Stefan.
Frederick's gone.
- Let's get out of here.
- I'm gonna kill him.
How many of those vervain darts do you have left? One.
Not gonna be enough.
Hey, Mom.
What's going on? What's it look like? Honestly, I wouldn't know.
I've never seen it before.
Well, sit down.
You might wanna order a pizza.
I'm out of practice.
Heh.
Mystery casserole.
Yum.
Yeah, some people aren't meant for the kitchen.
- What? - Um I know it's been rough.
But I'm gonna try.
I mean, really try this time.
You just have to bear with me, okay? Okay.
Okay.
Good.
- You know, I got it.
- That bad, huh? What happened to you? - Hey, Matt.
- Hey.
What's going on? Is your mom home? Give me 10 minutes.
Keep it out of the news until I get there.
Grab your stuff.
We gotta go.
- Kind of got half a burger left.
- They found Vicki Donovan.
Are you serious? Where was she? Storm unearthed the grave off County Road.
- They brought her body to the morgue.
- Wait.
She's dead? Come on, we gotta go.
Stefan, please.
Stefan.
Stefan, please, get up.
Come on, get up, Stefan.
Stefan.
Here.
Elena, please, run.
- No.
- Please.
Stefan, my wrists.
Here, take my wrist.
You need more blood.
No, Elena, run.
Run.
No.
I trust you.
So, what you said to get me to do this, about my wife it's a lie, wasn't it? - Yep.
Stop.
What's going on here? - What did you do? - Me? Your merry little band of vampires spent the day torturing my brother.
Trust me, the parties responsible for this will be dealt with.
Our arrangement doesn't work unless you learn to control them.
- This wasn't supposed to happen.
- Well, it did.
If I had a good side, not a way to get on it.
Stefan.
He's dead.
How are you doing? Uh, I'm okay.
The wounds have mostly healed.
Good.
- Elena.
- Yeah? What you did today, coming to help me you could have been killed.
I know.
And what I did, I'm sorry that, uh I'm sorry that you had to see it.
I've just never You were like this other person.
- And it's my fault, I made you - What? No, no, no.
You didn't make me do anything.
You were saving my life.
And I was saving yours.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Hey, Jer.
Wa? Wait, what's going on? Oh, no.
I made you some coffee.
Thanks.
Are you? Is there anything I can do? I just, uh I need to be alone right now.
Matt.
That was fun.
Don't look at me like that.
I know you hate me.
Guess what.
Everyone hates me.
But you can't deny we were badass.
Mm.
Happens.
Jer.
Are you okay? I'm gonna go get some sleep.
What are you doing? My My friend Vicki, uh she's She's dead.
Vicki? - The one you thought was a? - Yeah.
Turns out she's been dead all along.
She's the reason you wanted to turn.
You wanted to be with her.
Look, I'm sorry.
