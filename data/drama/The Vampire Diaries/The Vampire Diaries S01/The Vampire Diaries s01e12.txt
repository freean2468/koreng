Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena.
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
- Our love for Katherine wasn't real.
- I'm gonna bring her back.
- I'm Anna.
- I'm Jeremy.
My great-grandfather showed me a journal.
He had written creepy stuff about vampires.
Your turn.
Any sad relationship stories? I fell in love, married young, wife died.
I've never been in your room before.
Elena? - Who am I to you? - You are not Katherine.
- Why do I look like her? - You were adopted.
How you doing in there? Stefan, who was that man in the road? I don't know.
Do you remember anything else about him? I wish.
I never really saw his face.
He was wearing a hoodie.
All I can remember is that there was these black boots coming towards me.
I brought some vervain for, um, you and Jenna.
And, um, I made this bracelet for Jeremy.
A few extra ones for friends.
You can put it in jewelry, or you can even put it in food or drink but as long as it's in you or on you, a vampire cannot control you.
Wow, so much to remember.
I know, but there's another vampire in town.
So until we find out who it is and what he wants, we have to be careful.
Hey.
It's gonna be $22.
Elena, I need the money.
Uh, here, come in.
Just put it on the table.
Hey.
Um Keep the change.
Thanks.
And you have yourself a good night.
- What are you looking for, Damon? - Not your concern.
No, but putting Elena in harm's way, that is my concern.
- Heh, heh.
What are you talking about? - I'm talking about Atlanta.
Oh, yeah.
Elena and I had a blast.
I get it.
You're bitter because one of us gets to be with the person that we love and poor Katherine is just out of reach.
Unless there's another way for you to get into that tomb.
That what Bree said? - You're pathetic when you're fishing.
- You're transparent when deflecting.
Don't you have school? - Surprised? It's a good essay.
- Heh.
Your thoughts are clear, and your argument is well laid out.
It's just, uh You don't actually think there are vampires in Mystic Falls? No, I mean, I think statistically there's been more animal attacks mysterious deaths, uh, people gone missing and more than any other place in the whole commonwealth of Virginia.
It's conjecture but creative, which is why you got the A.
I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up in the whole conspiracy theory of it all.
Hey, I won't.
Oh, uh, Jeremy, the source that you cited for the 1860s info uh, "Johnathan Gilbert"? - Oh, my ancestor's journal? - I'd really like to see that sometime.
- Really? A first-person account of the Civil War, that's like, uh, porn for a history teacher.
If you think my essay is creative, wait till you get a load of this thing.
Thank you.
It's so pretty.
Thank you.
God, it'll go with, like, everything.
- What's the occasion? - No occasion.
Just a little friend gift.
A lesbian-friend necklace, because we're freaky like that? - Your friendship is important to me.
- Why are you being so mushy? Because you've been avoiding me.
And I wanted you to know that whatever is going on with you and Matt, it's okay.
I was gonna talk to you about that.
I was, but there's just not much to say.
We've hung out a couple times.
That's it.
But I just feel like we've peaked as friends.
This is weird.
I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
- It's weird.
It's weird, right? - It's a little weird but If it's what you and Matt want, then it's not about me.
But it's all about you.
Matt's not over you and we all know it.
I'm with Stefan now.
Matt understands that.
He knows he has to move on.
Matt Donovan.
What do you know? - Ben McKittrick.
What's up, man? - Rough season, bud.
Yeah, it's kind of hard to recover when you have to forfeit half your games.
You gonna be working here? Yep.
Following in your footsteps, minus the state championship.
- Well, can't all be football gods.
- Yeah.
So, what's the plan? Cook line? Busboy.
I can't believe you're adopted.
I never saw that coming.
And it gets weirder.
My birth certificate lists Miranda and Grayson Gilbert as my birth parents.
- None of it makes sense.
- Which is why you should ask Jenna.
First of all, the Elena I know would always want the real truth, good or bad.
And second of all? You just found out your boyfriend is a vampire.
So unless your birthparents are aliens, how bad could it be? Uh, okay, look, I have to go to the store.
My outfit for the dance is severely lacking accessories.
Okay, I'll pay the bill.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
What do you want from me? - I think we need a fresh start.
- You tried to kill me.
But I didn't.
And if I wanted to, I would have.
Does that not count for anything? You know I can start fires with my mind.
Fires kill vampires, right? Just stay the hell away from me.
Everything okay over here? Yeah, we're fine.
I wasn't talking to you.
Thank you.
- Anytime, Bonnie.
- Wait, you remember me? Heh.
I didn't graduate that long ago.
You're making me feel old.
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't I didn't mean that.
I just I didn't know you knew me.
I always know a pretty face.
- Hello? - Hello, Elena.
Hey, who is this? You hit me with your car.
Is that a new one? You got away from me.
You won't next time.
Why me? What does he want with me? And if he's trying to kill me, then why call first? It's because we're predators, Elena.
We hunt.
We stalk.
It's often as exciting as the kill.
I want you to take this.
This is Jeremy's pocket watch.
How did you get it? I took it from Damon who took it from Logan who must have taken it from you.
- What happened to it? - Well, it's not just a watch.
It's a sort of compass, but it points to vampires.
Why did my father have it? The Gilberts were one of the founding families, and back in 1864 they were among those who sought to eradicate the vampires.
The compass was used to find us.
Did you know them? Yes.
I want you to keep this.
That way, you'll know if you're ever in danger.
I've never seen you such a mess.
Heh.
Don't talk smack.
I mean, I just thought that you told everyone else what to do.
Well, I do that too.
But if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.
You know, I just like that we're hanging out.
- Who knew, you and me? - Well, who knew you could be fun? So, what are you wearing to this dumb dance anyway? - Should we color coordinate? - Um, I'm not going.
- Why not? - I gotta work.
- I'm bussing tables at the Grill.
- Since when are you a busboy? It's a job.
You know, some of us have to work, Caroline.
With my mom in and out, things are tight, so Well, I didn't mean it like that.
I just meant that I didn't know you had a job.
Well, I do.
I gotta go.
Hey, how'd it go? - What? - The paper.
Oh, uh, got an A.
Thanks for the articles.
They really helped.
Cool.
So, what'd he say about the vampires? - Did he believe it? - I don't even believe it.
It's just a paper, Anna.
Anyways, I, uh, gotta get going.
Hey, do you wanna do something later? Maybe? Oh, sorry, I'm stuck on punch duty at the school dance.
- Oh.
How'd you get stuck with that? - Well, I'm failing English, so I copped a plea.
So maybe, you know, tomorrow or something.
I'm being pushy again, aren't I? Well, thanks for the help.
I'll see you around.
Spoke to the insurance company.
Car is totaled.
- You can keep using mine for now.
- So you're coming to the dance? Alaric asked me to help chaperone.
Why didn't you tell me, Jenna? Your mom was gonna do it eventually.
I never thought I'd have to.
If my mom were here right now and I asked, she'd tell me the truth.
Your dad was about to leave the office one night when this girl showed up.
She was 16, a runaway, and about to give birth.
He delivered her baby and he gave her a place to stay but a few days later, she disappeared.
And there you were.
Your parents were trying so hard to have a baby.
It just wasn't happening.
All Miranda ever wanted was to be a mom.
But why were my parents' names on the birth certificate? Your dad was a doctor, Elena.
He took care of it.
They didn't wanna lose you, so they kept it quiet, told as few people as possible.
But if anyone ever wanted proof, they had documentation.
What else do you know about her? The girl.
Just her name.
Isobel.
You got the hair right.
- Why are you bringing me Dad's journal? - Because you were looking for it.
- And why would I want it? - Gee, I don't know, Damon.
Maybe you wanna do a little bit of posthumous bonding.
Go ahead.
Enjoy it.
Read it.
I have.
Nowhere in it does it say anything about Katherine or the tomb or how to open it.
I'm not surprised.
The man could barely spell his own name.
I'm really sorry that it won't be of any help with your diabolical plan, the sequel.
- You know, I could help you.
- You help me? I don't know.
It seems a little unnatural.
I'll do anything to get you out of this town.
- Even release Katherine.
- What about the other 26 vampires? No, no, they can't come.
They have to stay put, but Katherine I would consider that.
What are you doing? Hmm? What's your angle? Think about it.
- Why would I trust you? - See that's your problem, Damon.
You apply all of your shortcomings to everybody else.
If history is any indication, there's only one liar among us.
Hey, Jenna? Jenna? Jeremy? - Stefan's phone.
How may I help you? - Where is he? He's on his way to you.
Forgot his phone.
Thank God.
This compass was spinning.
Stefan must be here.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Elena! - Aah! You okay? You're okay.
Well, how'd he get in? He was invited in.
He posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.
Well, he gets points for that.
- Did he say what he wanted? - No, he was too busy trying to kill me.
- And you have no idea who this is? - No.
Don't look at me like that.
I told you we had company.
- You think there's more than one? - We don't know.
Damon, he was invited in.
Then we go get him tonight.
- You up for it? - What do I have to do? Let your boyfriend take you to the dance.
We'll see who shows up.
That's a bad idea.
Till we get him, this house isn't safe.
For anyone who lives in it.
It's worth a shot.
I'll do it.
I'll be with the two of you.
I'll be safe.
Alaric.
Hey, look at you.
I figured I'd stand out less if I dressed up.
Ha, ha.
Liar.
Okay, I'm a sucker for the decade dance.
I went to school here, you know.
They do the '60s and '70s too, FYI.
Aw, can't wait.
Can I get you a drink? I hear the punch is real boss.
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah.
Having fun? Mm, no, but this took about two hours, so I'm at least staying half of that.
What's Damon doing here? He wanted to come.
I promise, he'll behave.
What is this, a threesome? You and the Salvatore brothers? No, but if I'm gonna be with Stefan then I have to learn to tolerate Damon.
It's not like I can kill him.
- There's a thought.
- Mm, I'll help.
I'm really starting to see a change in Jeremy.
Finally.
Losing someone you love so suddenly, the trauma and the grief there is some of the tougher things he'll face in life.
From someone who knows.
You have no idea what happened? That's the hard part, not knowing.
Is it okay to talk about your wife? Heh.
Well, there's not much to talk about.
That must be impossible to deal with, not having any answers.
I'd be lying if I told you it didn't keep me up at night.
Wondering why and by who.
Maybe one day.
Hope so.
I hope so.
Hi, Bonnie.
Wanna dance? I'm out of here.
Please give me another chance.
Back off, Damon.
Where did they go? - I don't know.
- What'd you say to them? I was perfectly polite.
Elena would you like to dance? I would love to.
Humph.
May I have this dance? Shouldn't you guys be able to sense each other or something? No, it doesn't work that way.
You see him anywhere? Not unless he has a pompadour.
Well, it was not one of the better fashion trends.
Oh, come on, I'm sure you looked great back then.
- Are there pictures? - No.
Burned.
Buried.
Seriously, what was it like? The '50s.
Because in my mind I have this picture of somewhere between American Bandstand, Grease.
It's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.
Well, that and, you know, McCarthyism and segregation, the nuclear arms race - Okay, but there were poodle skirts.
- There were poodle skirts.
You are teaching me how to do the Hand Jive.
- No, that's not gonna happen.
- Aw You neglected to mention this was a theme party.
- What are you doing here? - Mm.
Seeing as you also neglected to invite me, I took matters into my own hands.
- You're doing that thing again.
- What thing would that be? The thing where you pretend we're dating even though we're not.
Oh.
You mean stalking? Yeah.
Ha, ha.
Get over yourself.
Come on, I've never been to a school dance before.
Humor me.
Let's sit up there.
Be a little more obvious, Bonnie.
- Don't rain on my hot-guy parade.
- What? It's just a drizzle.
I mean, Ben McKittrick, really? - He's hot.
- He's a washed-up jock who pours drinks for a living.
You could do way better.
- Hey.
- What's up? Hey, I don't recognize you.
How'd you get roped into chaperoning? Alaric Saltzman.
I'm the new history teacher.
- Oh, the cursed faculty position.
- So I've been told.
Damon Salvatore.
- Salvatore? As in, uh, Stefan? - He's my little brother.
I'm his legal guardian.
Hence, the chaperoning.
I hear he's very bright, not that I've had a chance to see for myself.
Well, his attendance record's a little spotty.
Family drama.
No parents? It's just the two of us now.
You, uh, live here your whole life? On and off.
Travel a bit.
Really? Where? Around the States? I'm sorry.
I'm nosy.
I don't mean to pry.
- Look, it was nice meeting you.
- You too.
Enjoy the rest of the dance.
Tonight was so much better on paper.
You're just feeling sorry for yourself.
Go and talk to him.
Be bold and fearless.
Yeah, this coming from the girl who's been eye-stalking the bartender.
You're right.
Hi.
- Twice in one day.
Lucky me.
- I'm proving something to my friend.
Oh, yeah? What's that? That you don't have to sit around and wait for a guy to come up to you.
Does that mean that you're asking me out on a date? - Does that mean you want me to? - What did you have in mind? - Do you like karaoke? - No.
But I would really like to go on a date with you.
- Seriously? - Is that for me? Do you see anyone else in the vicinity? Do you need something? - Are you mad at me or something? - No, Care, I'm not mad - Why are you being so weird? - I'm not.
I'm working.
- You're avoiding.
- No, I have a table to clean.
You know, that's the kind of thing that washed-up jocks do to make a living.
You don't go here.
You don't have to help.
Oh, I don't mind.
It's fun.
Oh, um, yeah, before I forget, can I borrow your ancestor's journal? - Why? - You said I could read it.
Uh, I don't have it.
Oh, well, obviously you didn't bring it here, but I can walk you home.
No, I mean, I gave it to my history teacher.
- Wait, why did you give it to him? - Because he wanted to read it.
You shouldn't be giving that to just anybody.
- But I should give it to you? - Loan.
Loan it to me.
Well, I loaned it to Mr.
Saltzman.
Maybe it's in his classroom.
We can get it back.
What's the big deal with the stupid journal? Your eye.
Uh, there's something in it.
Forget it.
I gotta go.
Maybe he's not gonna show.
You mean we did all this dancing for nothing? Oh, the horror.
Hee-hee.
- I'm really sorry for all this.
- It's my choice.
I decided to be here.
I officially signed up for it, so I don't wanna hear you apologizing anymore.
Show me how it was done in the '50s.
- Uh No.
- Come on.
One move? Now, you remember that because it's never gonna happen again.
- What are you doing here? - Trying to get the journal.
As in, sticking to the plan, something you're not doing.
- Leave the girl alone.
- I like her.
She looks like Katherine.
She's not Katherine, okay? Katherine is in the tomb.
I know, but until we open that tomb, I got her to play with.
Don't be stupid.
That girl is with the Salvatore brothers.
- They don't scare me.
They never have.
- Please, Noah, don't do this.
- You're gonna ruin everything.
- You got nothing to worry about.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
You will get what you came for.
Just let me have my fun.
She looks like Katherine.
You really can't take him anywhere, can you? Uh, no.
Stefan, the back corner.
Get Damon.
- What did I do? - Where is he? I was getting a soda, and then this guy gave me his hoodie.
Hello, Elena.
Here's what you're going to do.
There's an exit door behind you.
- You have five seconds.
- No.
Or your brother dies.
I can snap his neck so fast, I bet there's not even a witness.
- Now, start walking.
- Don't you dare touch him.
Keep walking.
Through the door.
Hey, dickhead.
Nobody wants to kill you.
We just wanna talk.
- Now you feel like talking? - Screw you.
Wrong answer.
Why are you doing this? Because it's fun.
What do you want with Elena? She looks like Katherine.
You knew Katherine? Aw You thought you were the only ones.
You don't even remember me.
Tell me how to get in the tomb.
Hmm? No.
- The grimoire.
- Well, where is it? Check the journal.
The journal.
Use Johnathan's journal.
Johnathan Gilbert's.
Who else is working with you? - Who else is there? - No.
You're gonna have to kill me.
What? What do? How are you gonna find the others now? - He had to die.
- But Elena he's been invited in.
Go.
I got this.
- Hey.
- What were you doing? - Looking for Miss Hilden.
- Why are you in Mystic Falls? - Got a job as a teacher.
- Do you know what I am? - My student's brother.
- You're telling me the truth? - Yes.
- Then forget we had this conversation.
No way that idiot was working alone.
You are.
So the grimoire, it was Emily's, right? That's what you need to reverse the spell? The founding families burned her, took her things and you were hoping that Dad's journal would tell you where it is.
Look at you putting the pieces together.
Good for you.
I was half right.
Well, it's out there now.
Let the games begin.
- My offer still stands.
- With some hidden caveats, no doubt.
No.
Nothing hidden about it.
No lies.
No deception.
I'm there when you open up that tomb, you and Katherine go and the other 26 vampires die.
- Lf I agree? - I'll help you.
Why should I trust you? - I'm your brother.
- No, that's not gonna cut it.
Because I want you gone.
Okay.
Look, I said something stupid.
I'm sorry, but I wasn't even talking about you.
Yes, you were, Caroline.
Ben could easily be me.
We're just alike.
That's not true.
Are you seriously mad about this? Matt, you know me.
Okay, I say stupid things without thinking and then I have to apologize and take it back and I'm a terrible, awful person, but I'm working on it.
Look, can we just not do this right now? Okay.
When do you get off? Look, this thing we've got, it's nice and it feels really good.
And I know you wanna take the next step How do you know that? Have you even asked me? I'm not over Elena.
I don't I mean, I don't know if I am but if we go there, then it could mess things up and we might lose this.
And this is the only good thing I've got going for me right now.
If it doesn't work, I'll just disappoint you and hurt you and I don't wanna do that.
Well, big problem, Matt because you took the next step all by yourself and you played the whole thing out in your head and decided to bail before even giving it a shot.
So this really great thing that we have, don't worry about losing it because it's already gone.
Thank you.
I needed that.
Well, thank you for coming.
I really appreciate it.
You made the evening much more Well, you made it, period.
Well, glad I could help.
And thank you for putting up with all that wife talk.
I, heh, gotta stop doing that.
It doesn't bode well for dating.
- Is that what this was, a date? - No, definitely not a date.
But Friday you, me, and dinner and a movie, that could be a date.
- How about it? - Works for me.
All right.
You can talk about your wife all you want.
It's gonna take time to heal.
We should just be ourselves.
Still, I think I'll keep the Isobel talk to a minimum.
- Isobel? - Yeah.
That was her name.
Where was Isobel from? Virginia.
I mean, not too far from here, actually.
Caroline.
Care, get in the truck.
What? This'll never work.
Doing okay? Is it weird if I say yes? - Is it true? - I should feel more upset or scared or something, but I feel kind of exhilarated.
It's the adrenaline.
You'll crash soon enough.
Yeah, I guess.
I fought back tonight.
It felt good.
- I wish you didn't have to fight at all.
- Still I need to tell you something, and I don't know how you're gonna feel about it.
What? I told Damon that I'd help him get into that tomb, get Katherine back.
But it was a lie.
I let him believe that he could trust me.
Then why would you be worried about telling me? Because he can be very persuasive and you two have bonded lately.
That doesn't mean I trust him.
It's gonna take a lot more than just a road trip and a rescue for me to forget who Damon is and everything he's done.
I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena, but I can't let him do it.
Then don't.
And I'll help you, whatever it takes.
Okay? Okay.
Come here.
Don't sneak up on me.
You love it.
Where's Noah? His obsession got the best of him and so did the Salvatore brothers.
- They killed him? - Tortured and staked.
You're not very upset.
I warned him, Ben, and he was just gonna screw everything up anyway.
Let's be honest, he wasn't exactly an asset.
How'd you do? Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me.
- Did you get the journal? - No, but I know where it is and I'll get it.
