Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret, until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
What are you? - I'm a vampire.
- You said you don't kill to survive.
Animal blood keeps me alive.
- But not as strong as Damon.
- Hello, brother.
- Damon.
- Stefan finally fessed up.
Stay away from me.
That necklace contains an herb called vervain.
- It protects you from being compelled.
- I will keep your secret.
But I can't be with you, Stefan.
- What is that? - A very important crystal.
- Are you psychic or clairvoyant? - Technically, Grams says I'm a witch.
There was a time when this town was very much aware of vampires.
- Five bodies all drained of blood? - They've come back.
You just don't wanna die, do you? She's transitioning.
- Into what? - A vampire.
- I don't know what's wrong with her.
- She'll be fine.
- We'll all be fine.
- Vicki.
I'll make sure that she does not hurt anybody, Elena.
I promise you.
- All right, later, man.
- See you, bro.
- Hi, Ty.
- Whoa.
Vicki? - Everyone's looking for you.
- I know.
What's wrong, Vick? - I'm so cold.
- You on drugs? - Everyone thinks you're off on a bender.
- I wish.
What happened in those woods? Those kids that were killed.
What did you see? - I'm so scared.
- Come here.
It's okay.
I'll take you home.
- I can't control it.
- Control what? I am so hungry, Ty.
And it won't go away.
What are you on? What drugs did you take? I want it.
I'm so hungry, Ty.
Okay, look, I'll get you something to eat.
Just sit back.
Let's just get you home.
Vicki.
What is wrong with you? Vick.
Unh.
Vicki, no! Let go of me! Unh! What's going on? What's wrong with her? - You don't talk.
- Screw you, dude.
- "Dude"? Really? "Dude"? - Damon, don't.
Oh, come on.
Who's gonna miss this idiot? Don't you hurt him.
Forget what you saw here tonight.
None of us were here.
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, it's cool.
I'm done.
You're up early.
Where are you going? Police station.
They're organizing a search party for Vicki.
- Wait.
Shouldn't you be going to school? - You're kidding me, right? You shouldn't skip school.
If they find her, we'll know.
That's what cell phones are for.
Yeah, your lips keep moving.
I don't know why.
- Yeah - Matty? Vicki, where are you? Are you okay? - I'm okay.
- Tell me where you are.
- I'll come get you.
- No, Matty.
I just need some time to figure things out.
Just know that I'm okay, okay? Please don't worry about me.
I don't understand why I have to stay.
Why can't I go home? Because you're changing, Vicki, and it's not something you wanna do alone.
There's nothing about that Logan guy I killed in here.
Not a word.
- Someone's covering it up.
- What is that? This is a very special, very old compass.
What was Logan Fell doing with it? Aren't you curious? Well, if you're so worried that somebody's onto you, leave town.
We should all be worried.
Hey, I'm hungry.
Do you have anything to eat? Here.
- What is it? - It's what you're craving.
Heh.
Don't lie to the girl.
It's so not what you're craving, but it'll do in a pinch.
- What is it - Yeah, what is it? Is it skunk? St.
Bernard? Bambi? - Go on, give it a try.
- She's new.
She needs people blood.
She can't sustain on that stuff.
- Mm, yeah, why can't I have people blood? - Yeah.
Because it's wrong to prey on innocent people, Vicki.
You don't have to kill to feed.
Find someone tasty and then erase their memory.
It's so easy.
There's no guarantee that you can control yourself, okay? It takes years to learn that.
You could kill somebody.
You have to carry that with you for the rest of your life, which is eternity.
Don't listen to him.
He walks on a moral plane way out of our eyeline.
I say snatch, eat, erase.
Hey, look at me.
We choose our own path.
Our values and our actions, they define who we are.
Okay, Count Deepak.
- I am out of here.
- Yum.
Can I have some more? - Is Stefan here? - Yep.
Where is he? And good morning to you, Little Miss I'm-on-a-Mission.
How can you be so arrogant and glib after everything that you've done? And how can you be so brave and stupid to call a vampire arrogant and glib? - Lf you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.
- Yes, you would.
- But I'm not.
- Yet.
- Where is Stefan? - He's upstairs.
Singing "The Rain in Spain.
" Knock yourself out.
Stefan? - Stefan - Yes? - Where is Vicki? - She's upstairs.
What happens now? My brother is searching for her with the rest of the town.
- What do I tell him? - I'm working with her.
It's gonna take time.
She's a very volatile and impulsive personality.
She's a drug user.
That's gonna play a part in how she responds to this.
So she's a vampire with issues? What am I supposed to do? Because I am lying to everyone that I care about.
- What's gonna happen to her? - I'm gonna keep her here until I know that she's safe.
How long is that? - We can talk about that later.
- Hey.
- Vicki.
How are you? - How am I? You're kidding, right? Was our family burned in the witch trials? No, the girls that were persecuted in Salem were entirely innocent.
You have to have more than ignorance to trap a real witch.
Well, how did we end up in Mystic Falls? Our family fled Salem in 1692 and relocated here.
Our ancestors lived in secrecy for over a hundred years.
It's important that we still do.
Grams, everybody knows you're a witch.
They also know it's absurd.
Can't be true.
I'm just a kooky lady that teaches occult at the university.
No one really believes.
They just poke fun.
And let them.
Don't let them know the truth.
Where is the witchcraft? I mean, you've been talking history for two days.
- I wanna get to the fun part.
- It's not meant to be fun.
It's real and it's serious.
And you must understand it before you practice it.
Aren't you late for school? - Thanks for the update.
- Yes, sir.
We never should've trusted that Logan weasel with the watch.
- How many are we dealing with? The coroner thinks one.
The wound radius and the jaw pattern Are we in danger? If it found the watch, then it knows we know.
And could it come after us? And should I even be saying "it"? - Is it a he or a she? - Lf it has any historical knowledge of the town, it'll know where the watch came from.
Yes, we could be in danger.
- So, what do we do? - Just keep it quiet.
We can't have the entire town aware of this.
We have to find it before it finds us.
Hey, man.
I heard they're putting together a search party for Vicki.
She just called.
She's okay.
Good.
That's great.
I figured you must've been going out of your mind.
Little bit, yeah.
I was just gonna offer, you know, if there's anything I could do.
I appreciate it.
I have got your costume.
It's all here.
- Seriously? - Ahh, come on.
Can someone please be excited that it's Halloween? I just wanna have fun.
You know, just some silly, fluffy, Damon-free fun.
- Isn't this the one you got from Damon? - Yep.
Wear it, toss it.
I don't care.
I want it gone.
Have you seen Elena? Do we know what she's wearing? I was with Grams all weekend.
I haven't talked to her.
Maybe she's with Stefan.
- Riding to his castle on his white horse? - Oh, don't be bitter.
- It provokes wrinkles.
- Heh.
Coffee is our friend.
It's the caffeine.
It circulates through our veins and warms our bodies so we're not so cold to the touch.
Well, what if I wanna drink human blood? You have to learn to live with that urge.
Fight it on a daily basis, one day at a time.
Oh, God.
Don't start with that whole 12 Steps thing.
School counselor has been down that road.
It doesn't work for me.
- It can work.
It's your choice, Vicki.
- So you've never tasted human blood? - Not in a long time.
- How long? Years and years.
I'm not proud of my past behavior.
Does this sketchy feeling ever go away? It's like I have a massive hangover.
This daylight thing is a bitch.
Ugh.
I need more blood.
Where's your bathroom? I have to pee.
Why do I have to pee? I thought I was dead.
I'm gonna, uh I'm gonna get her some more.
Right.
I'll be quick.
False alarm.
My body's feeling really funky.
It's a good funk, but it's weird.
Hmm.
- Who are you calling? - Jeremy.
- Vicki, you can't see Jeremy anymore.
- Oh, come on.
- I'm gonna see whoever I wanna see.
- Even though you could hurt him? - I would never hurt Jeremy.
- I know you think that.
But I can't take that risk.
- You're gonna have to let Jeremy go.
- Oh, really? And how long have you been preparing the you're-not-good-enough speech? I assume it predates the vampire thing.
All I'm saying is Jeremy is not getting involved in any of this.
- I mean it, Vicki.
- Or what? Let's get one thing straight, you perky little bitch.
You had my brother whipped for 15 years.
Fifteen years.
And then you dumped him.
When I look at you, that is all I see.
Just so you know.
And I'm gonna see Jeremy whenever I wanna see Jeremy.
I have some fun new toys to play with and I won't think twice about ripping your little head off.
You got it? - She threatened me.
- She's on edge.
Imagine every sense in your body operating at super-speed.
I mean, she's uncomfortable in her own skin.
- When you throw in her other issues - How long before it settles? - Hours? Days? Weeks? - There's no rulebook.
Well, how long before you learned to control it? A while.
I didn't have anybody helping me.
I had to do it on my own.
The thing is, it's hard to resist certain people, especially when you're new.
Love, lust, anger, desire.
- Hunger.
- What does that mean? It means Jeremy can't see her.
She might not be able to resist him.
- And she could hurt him.
- Or worse.
I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.
- I need to get going.
- Elena.
Please, Stefan, there's only so much I can take.
What are you doing? Just contemplating the next hundred years.
Hmm.
Why did you do it? I was bored.
You did this to me out of boredom? It's one of the pitfalls of eternity.
I'm bored.
All I can think about is blood.
I just want some blood.
I can't think about anything else.
What is that about? Ha, ha.
That'll ease up.
You've just been cooped up all day.
- Let's go.
- Where? Well, your life was pathetic.
Your afterlife doesn't have to be.
- What are you doing? - She's been cooped up all day.
- She's not Anne Frank.
- No, no.
- Hey, hey.
Now's not the time for this.
- Lf you're gonna teach her, teach her.
- Show her what it's all about.
- She could hurt someone.
I'm not taking her to Disneyland.
We're going to the front yard.
Come on.
Bad idea, Damon.
She's a vampire, Stefan.
She should know the perks.
Like what? Like Whoa.
How did you do that? Come on, Vicki.
Live a little.
No pun intended.
Uh Tsk.
My bad.
- Matt - Vicki? Is that you? Hey.
Get in here.
In a minute.
L Please come inside.
I've been worried.
Thank God you're okay.
I'm fine.
- Where were you, Vick? - It's no big deal.
Drop it already.
Three people were murdered in the woods.
The cops were looking for you.
They wanna question you.
- They know where I live.
- Everyone was worried about you.
I'm back now.
Just let it go.
Are you kidding? I had a freaking search party out looking for you while you were off on your crazy drug trip, and you want me to let it go? - My head hurts.
- You think? - What are you doing here - Is Vicki home? - Yeah.
- Can I see her? - I don't want him in here.
- Did he do something to you? - No.
I just don't want him in here.
- Let me come in so I can explain myself.
I don't know what's going on, but I think you should leave.
Right now, Stefan.
You gotta call me, Vick.
I don't get it.
What's going on with you? Just Just call me, please.
Hey.
So, um, do you wanna hang out tonight? We could go to the Halloween thing at school.
Could be fun.
Cool.
Sure.
Sounds fun.
Can't wait.
I know you're upset about Vicki.
I heard she called Matt.
But you can't be with her.
She needs to get better.
The best thing you can do for her is let her go.
What does that even mean, "let her go"? Oh, okay, sure.
Since we're such experts on letting people go, right? I know you may not see it, but trust me, Jer, it's for the best.
For months after Mom and Dad died, I felt like crap.
Like nothing-really-even-mattered crap.
All of a sudden, I get these moments, and things started to feel a bit better.
And Vicki was in every single one of them.
So you may not see it, but trust me keeping me away from her is not for the best.
Cider for the ladies? It's a Lockwood special.
Oh, no way.
Last year, I was hung-over until Thanksgiving.
Lightweight.
I am going to drink until someone is hot enough to make out with.
Sounds like a plan.
- How many martinis have you had? - Ugh, don't start with me.
Can we go now? - We're late for the party.
Let's go.
- So go ahead.
I'd like to finish my drink.
Let me guess.
- Daisy Buchanan.
- Ha, ha.
- I love a good Gatsby look.
- I've met you before.
- Aren't you Caroline Forbes' boyfriend? - Ah, she had a schoolgirl crush on me, but It was cute, but I had to let her down easy.
- It's Damon, right? - Oh, you remember.
Oh, you have a face that's hard to forget.
What's your last name, Damon? - Salvatore.
- Salvatore? Mm-hm.
- Are you any relation to Zach? - Zach's my uncle.
How do you know Zach? Are you okay? Yeah.
I think there's something in my eye.
Well, I know Zach from the Founder's Council.
You know, the Salvatores were one of this town's original settlers.
Yes, they were.
I wasn't aware that Zach was a member.
I recently moved back home and haven't really had a chance to meet many of his friends.
- Will you tell him to return my calls? - I've left several messages.
- Zach went out of town for a bit.
But if it's about the vervain - You know about the vervain? - Well, I'm a Salvatore.
- Of course I do.
- Of course.
Cheers.
Well, watch out.
- Aah! - Aah! You went with last year's costume too.
I didn't know I was coming till an hour ago.
Me neither.
And you're going as you? He's not talking to me right now.
We got into a fight.
I got into it with Vick too when she got home.
I'm trying not to smother her, but part of me didn't wanna let her out of my sight.
- She's here? - Yeah.
You can't miss her.
She's a vampire.
- Where did Jeremy go? - Elena, what's the matter? I gotta find him.
You're following me now? You didn't really give me much of a choice.
- Let me out of here.
- You shouldn't be here.
Crowds like this, it makes it even harder for you to keep yourself under control.
- I'm fine.
- Really? - Mm-hm.
- No headache? Your stomach's not screaming at you? You're not feeling lightheaded or cranky like if someone looks at you the wrong way, you could rip their head off? Do you wanna know what that's called? It's called hunger.
And it's only gonna get worse and worse every minute that you pretend like it's not controlling you.
So you need vervain? Yes.
My husband and I only have left what his parents left him.
And Zach had promised that he could supply us with more.
Well, I talk to him all the time.
So why don't I just ask him? - Hmm.
- Mm.
How much do you need? I mean, how many people do you think? - Well, there's our children, of course.
- Of course.
Ha, ha.
And friends, family, and everyone on the council.
The council? - Zach knows how many.
- Mm.
You know what? I am so late.
My husband is not going to be happy with me.
Well, are you happy with your husband? - You're flirting with me.
- You flirted with me first.
True.
Let me escort you to the school.
It's not safe out there alone.
- Mm.
- I mean, I've seen 10 vampires tonight.
Well, if only the real ones were as easy to find.
- How's that search going? - Oh, well, we had the Founder's Party.
And anyone who arrived during the day was eliminated as a suspect.
- Oh.
- And all the rest were just dead ends, so - Hmm.
Mm.
- Hmm.
- I gotta go.
- Okay.
- Thank God.
- What's the matter? - I lost track of Jeremy.
I was worried.
- What's going on? - Hey.
Everything's fine.
- I told you to quit bothering me.
- No, Vicki, don't do this.
- Matt, he won't leave me alone.
- You need to back off.
- Matt, it's okay.
No, it's not okay.
What the hell is your problem? Stefan.
She's gone.
I'm trying to help her.
Whoa! - Vick, you scared the hell out of me.
- Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Okay.
So where'd Caroline run off to? Do yourself a favor and don't ask me about Caroline.
- Oh, Bonnie.
So loyal.
- Just stay away from her.
Where'd you get that? - From a friend.
- Caroline.
- You know that's mine, don't you? - Not anymore.
Funny.
- I'd like it back.
- I'm not giving it to you.
I'll give it to Caroline.
She can give it to you.
Or I could just take it right now.
Jeremy.
I was so worried about you.
I'm fine now.
But I gotta leave.
What? Where? I gotta get out of here, Jer.
I can't live at home with Matt.
- He just doesn't get it.
- No, you can't.
You can't just leave.
Come with me.
If you come with me, we can be together forever.
Okay.
Yeah.
Ow.
Taking that costume a little too far? - I know.
- So cool.
Man, that was awesome.
What? What is it? Vicki? Vicki.
Vicki, what the hell? Oh, my God.
Vicki.
Vicki, no! Stop! Vicki! No! Aah! Vicki, no! No! Vicki.
Go.
Get inside.
Go! Vicki! Vicki.
Vicki! Vicki! Vicki.
Vicki.
Vicki! Get him out of here.
- What? - I need your help.
- What happened to you? - I did something.
I don't know.
It came from my necklace.
Where'd you get that? It's part of my costume.
It's a piece of junk.
That piece of junk belonged to one of the most powerful witches of our family.
Let me show you.
There she is.
Emily Bennett.
Your great-great-great-great-grandmother.
And there's your necklace.
You should go.
I got this.
You did this.
This is your fault.
You confuse me for someone with remorse.
None of this matters to me.
None of it.
People die around you.
How could it not matter? It matters, and you know it.
Mm.
You need to leave.
Your wounds are bleeding, and you need to leave.
Elena.
Hey, have you seen? - Whoa.
What happened? - Nothing.
Some idiot with some fake blood got me.
- I'm gonna go home and shower.
- I can't find Vicki.
She totally bailed on me.
I don't know where she is.
Is this what I'm in for? A lifetime of worrying about her? You're a good brother, Matt.
Yeah.
Maybe she went home.
Maybe.
Okay.
Where is he? Inside.
Do you understand what happened tonight? No.
I don't understand.
I mean, I know what I saw, but I don't understand.
- She was going to kill me.
- Now she's dead.
Vicki's dead.
- I'm so sorry, Jer.
I'm - Just make it stop.
It hurts.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Why does everybody have to die on me? Oh, my God.
Come here.
Are you okay? I wanted to help her.
But instead, uh - How's he doing? - He's a mess.
I don't want him going through this again.
He's just a kid.
Elena, what can I do? L What can I do to help? I'll do anything.
Can you make him forget? - Elena - Stefan, please.
I don't know how he'll ever get past this.
I want him to forget everything that happened.
If I did it, there's no guarantee that it would work because of who I am, because of how I live.
- I don't have the ability to do it right.
- I can do it.
If this is what you want l'll do it.
It's what I want.
What do you want him to know? I want you to tell him that Vicki left town and she's not coming back.
That he shouldn't look for her or worry about her.
He's gonna miss her, but he knows it's for the best.
Part of me wishes that I could forget too.
Forget meeting you finding out what you are, and everything that's happened since.
If that's what you want.
Yes.
It is.
Because I don't want it to be like this.
I don't wanna feel like this.
But I can't.
With everything that's happened I can't lose the way I feel about you.
It's done.
