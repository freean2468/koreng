Previously on The Vampire Diaries: For over a century, I have lived in secret, until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
- How come you don't sparkle? - Because vampires burn in the sun.
- You go in the sun.
- I have a ring.
Protects me.
The pocket watch, where is it? - It's mine.
- Did you get the Gilbert watch? - I can get it.
- Good.
We need it.
- What is that? - It's a very important crystal.
You're the mystery guy, and I like that, but with mystery comes secrets.
- I just need you to trust me.
- Trust is earned.
Caroline, what happened? - Nothing.
- Did Damon hurt you? - There are bruises all over Caroline.
- I'm handling it.
Vervain could weaken him if he ingested it.
It would help get you the upper hand.
I knew I couldn't spike your drink, so I spiked hers.
- Five bodies all drained of blood? - They've come back.
Where's my ring? Won't be needing it anymore.
- How long have I been here? - Three days.
What are you doing? During the Dark Ages, when a vampire's actions threatened to expose or bring harm upon the entire race they would face judgment.
They sought to reeducate them rather than to punish them.
You know what will happen if I don't feed on blood.
You'll grow weaker and weaker.
And eventually, you won't be able to move or speak.
In a week, your skin will desiccate, and you'll mummify.
A living corpse.
Unable to hurt anyone.
Ever.
So, what, you're just gonna leave me in the basement forever? I've injected you with enough vervain to keep you weak.
Once your circulation stops, I'll move you to the family crypt and then in 50 years, we can reevaluate.
- I'm stronger than you think.
- You always have been.
But you're not stronger than the vervain, and we both know it.
I'm sorry.
Didn't have to be this way.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm almost done.
It's okay.
Take your time.
I think you might be in trouble.
What'd you do? - Elena saw me.
- I'm a drug-using delinquent.
Girl in bed doesn't really rank.
Sorry.
Jenna.
Are you aware of what's going on upstairs? Uh-huh.
- And you have no objection? - He could be craftier about it.
At least make an effort to sneak her in and out.
Oh, and just so you know, I won't be home for dinner.
Ohh.
So you're actually going to do it.
You're gonna go out with Logan.
I'm gonna show up and torture him, yes.
And have you heard from Stefan? Not since he left that very vague message three days ago.
"Hi.
Um, Elena, I, um I have something I have to do.
I'll, uh, explain in a few days.
" - Haven't you called him? - Nope.
Not going to either.
And you're okay with everything? No, I'm not okay with any of it.
But I'm not gonna cry about it either.
I was gonna write in my diary, "What am I gonna write?" I'm not gonna be one of those girls whose world stops spinning because of some guy.
Okay, then.
I'll be fine.
He's awake.
He's weak, but it's probably best to stay out of the basement.
He's Damon.
I'm not sure how dangerous he might be.
- You're going to school? - Came here to live a life.
It's time I get back to that, and Elena, if she's still speaking to me.
Why haven't you called her? What am I supposed to do, feed her another lie? I hate lying.
I'm not good at it.
She thinks I'm hiding something.
What choice do you have? You came back here because you wanted to live as normal a life as you could.
You knew this was gonna be a part of it.
I remember the party.
Damon came up behind me and he was kissing my neck, or biting my neck.
I passed out.
It's like there's holes in my memory lately.
It's just weird.
- Maybe I let him bite me.
- Why would you do that? Can we just not talk about it? Okay? I just don't wanna talk about Damon.
I don't wanna talk about any of it.
Just want to go back to normal.
What are you doing with that candle? Um Nothing.
What's this? Damon gave it to me.
Or he was going to give it to me.
- All I know is it's mine now.
- It's ugly.
Well, then get your grubby hands off it.
The Sexy Suds Car Wash is tomorrow.
The football team and the band have committed.
Well, not all the band.
Just the ones who can pull off a bikini.
I want in-your-face sexy.
I mean, it's a fundraiser, for God's sake.
Unbelievable.
- It's like nothing happened.
- She's in denial.
Hey.
Hey.
Uh, you know, I gotta go uh, be somewhere right now.
I'm so sorry I haven't called.
No worries.
I'll live.
I was dealing with Damon.
- And did you deal with Damon? - Yes.
Yeah.
For four days? You have every right to be upset with me.
- But can I explain it all to you, please? - Sure.
When? I gotta be home after school, but the Grill around 4:00? - Okay.
- Thanks.
Stefan, where's Damon? He has some serious apologizing to do.
He's gone, Caroline.
When's he coming back? He's not coming back.
I'm sorry.
This is a good thing, Caroline.
I know that.
- Hey, Matt.
Um, have you seen Stefan? - Nope.
But if you wanna kill some time, you can rack.
Come on, we haven't played in forever.
I'll let you break.
I'm full of vervain.
I've been putting it in my coffee for 16 years.
My blood will only make you worse.
- Damon? - So it was your vervain? Good for you.
Good for you.
Family only runs so deep, huh? We're not family, Damon.
Only in the most dysfunctional sense.
In fact, I avoided having a living, breathing, loving family because of you.
I don't guess I could talk you into bringing me a rabbit or something? I'd settle for Stefan's diet at this point.
You know I can't do that.
You succeeded, Zach.
I'm shutting down.
You're like your grandfather.
He didn't like it when I came to visit either.
But you don't visit, Damon.
You appear, unannounced, reminding me that this isn't my house that you're just permitting me to live here.
Hell, that you're permitting me to live.
Someone had to mow the lawn.
I came to say goodbye, Damon.
Unlock the door, Zach.
Keep it up, Damon.
More energy you expend, the faster you'll go.
And there's Vicki all nonchalant in the bathroom like it's no big deal that they're hooking up.
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, your brother and my sister, that's weird.
Yeah.
How late is he? Hitting the hour mark.
Nothing's wrong, though.
Which means I'm not talking boy problems with you.
Good.
I mean, it's not like we were ever best friends or anything.
Okay.
Here goes.
What do you think of Stefan? - Is he a good guy? - Why? What's he done? Not any one thing.
He's just so secretive.
I think there's something that he doesn't want me to know, which makes me wanna know.
Like that he's a serial killer and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk? No, of course not.
But what do we know about him, really? He's great at football.
Little bit of a loner.
And as much as I hate saying it, he might be a nice guy.
So you think I'm just being paranoid? - I think you should talk to him.
- Talk to who? I'm so sorry that I'm late.
- What happened? - I got held up.
- Is everything okay? - There's this thing with my uncle.
You couldn't call and tell me you're gonna be an hour late? Okay.
You two have fun.
- I'm really sorry.
It was unavoidable.
- What was unavoidable? - Okay.
- No.
Elena, please.
No, Stefan, don't you get it? Every question gets a vague non-answer.
What is so awful that you're afraid to tell me? I know you.
My God.
- I'm sorry? - I know you.
- How can it be? - I think you have the wrong person, sir.
You haven't aged a day.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Hey, can I take you home, and we can talk about it? Is that okay? Wait.
What was that? I don't know.
Nothing.
Right, nothing.
Okay.
Um I gotta go, Stefan.
Excuse me.
I tried.
I want so much to make things right but every instinct in my body is telling me to be careful.
What you don't know can hurt you.
Evening, sheriff.
- Anything? - We went over the west side of the lake.
All the caverns by the falls were clean.
No signs of habitat.
Then they're staying in town.
We canvassed all abandoned buildings and warehouses.
- There has to be a private residence.
- And that much harder to locate.
These creatures know how to go undetected.
Someone who only comes out at night should become obvious.
- What about the watch? - I'm working on it.
I knew the Gilberts.
That watch is passed down to the men in the family.
- I'd start with Jeremy.
- Hey, Logan.
Can't believe you really came.
You have an hour.
Make it count.
- You okay - Is Vicki in there? Don't answer a question with another question.
Maybe.
What's wrong with you? I'm miserable.
Well, you should go get something to eat.
Jenna? Jenna? Stefan? - What are you doing here? - Dinner.
Jeremy told me chicken Parmesan is one of your favorites.
And I happen to be a good cook.
Italian roots demand it.
I can even make my own homemade mozzarella.
Only, tonight, it is, unfortunately, store-bought.
Sorry.
I don't know what you're trying to accomplish.
You wanna know me, right? Well, I figure if you're gonna dump me you should at least, um, know who you're dumping.
- So let's start with Katherine.
- Stefan She was the most beautiful girl that I had ever met.
She had this perfect olive skin.
And she had this laugh.
It was ridiculous.
I mean, her laugh made you laugh.
And she was fun.
She knew how to have a good time.
But Katherine was also very impatient and entitled and selfish and impulsive.
Enter Damon.
He claims that he was with her first.
I don't know.
I do know that I did some things that I'm not proud of.
And my biggest regret is not being able to make it right before she died.
I miss her but I'm no longer crippled by her loss.
It was very nice what you did for Stefan.
- Very romantic.
- Well, I was feeling romantic.
Look what I found.
"Elena Gilbert.
Take one tablet every four to six hours as needed for pain.
" Those are left over from the car accident.
So she won't miss them.
No, not with that.
That's an antique.
I feel like we're always getting high.
- That's the beauty of choice.
- Well, then let's choose not to.
I mean, we don't have to be high all the time, right? I hope you're not one of those guys who, now that we're together, tries to change everything about me.
No.
Good.
I'm an avid reader.
Huge Fitzgerald fan.
The Great Gatsby, his masterpiece.
But I'm no snob.
I love some good Grisham.
I think Seinfeld is the best American television show of the past 50 years but I Love Lucy is all-time.
The "Loving Cup" episode is the best, I think.
Huge Scorsese fan.
I can watch Taxi Driver over and over again.
Here.
Let me.
As far as music, Dylan, Hendrix, Patsy, Willie, little Kanye.
You know what? I even like that one Miley song.
Easy.
I didn't say anything.
Hey, this is for the garlic bread, right? Because I'm not eating garlic unless you agree to, too.
Are you kidding? I love garlic.
Ow! Ah! - You okay? - Um Yeah, I think so.
- Your face.
- Yeah, yeah.
I think I got something in my eye.
Stefan.
Hey.
Stefan.
Um, I think that my paranoia has turned into full-blown hallucinations.
Part of your charm.
Caroline.
Caroline.
No, Tiki, do not do the one-piece, okay? I've seen it on you.
Trust me.
Yeah, we are going for a stripper-pole vibe this year.
Caroline.
Yeah, maybe we should wash the cars in slow motion.
No.
Caroline.
What? Oh, no, sorry.
Um So I'll just see you tomorrow.
Two-piece.
Okay.
Bye.
Shoo.
Shoo.
Shoo! God.
I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself, aren't you? - Not particularly.
- You won.
You got the bad guy.
Now nothing can come between you and Elena.
Except the truth.
The lies will catch up to you, Stefan.
Long as you keep lying to yourself about what you are.
The beauty of you in there and me out here is that I can walk away.
No friend discounts.
No freebies.
No pay-you-laters.
We are not running a charity here.
- No, we are not.
- Hi.
Hey.
Uh, the event is called Sexy Suds, you know? Did we just get scolded? - And judged, yeah.
- Wow.
I'm sorry, but I guess you're gonna have to take that off.
Uh, I think you have to go first.
Okay.
Okay.
Um Sorry.
So not sexy.
I disagree.
Uh-uh.
No.
None of that tortured pining stuff.
- I'm just observing.
- Uh-huh.
Oh.
Tiki.
This one's yours.
Why do I always get the homely ones? Just to be clear, your car's a POS.
I mean, we can wash it, but it's still a POS.
You don't have to be rude.
No, rude is uglying up the road with that junker.
What the Oh, my God.
What the? Whoa.
Hey.
- Whoa! - What the hell? Wet and wild, Tik.
Proceeds are going to the school's Athletic Department still healing from the tragic death of their football coach, William Tanner.
The citizens of Mystic Falls coming together in support of one of their own.
Cut it.
- Classy.
- Thank you.
But you're still gonna video the girls in bikinis, right? Oh, 53 percent of Americans watch the news with the sound off.
Thank you for dinner.
I had a nice time.
Do you remember the last time we were in the school parking lot? Nope.
Doesn't ring a bell.
- Really? Hm.
- Nada.
Especially not having sex in the minivan.
Yeah.
That was a good day.
- What? - Ha, ha.
- You're getting soap in that.
- Oh, it's fine.
I noticed that Damon has one too.
Is there a story behind it? Yeah, it's the, um It's the family crest.
It's from the Italian Renaissance.
Huh.
What's the stone? - It's called lapis lazuli.
- Ah.
You should really take it off.
I can put it in my bag.
No, it's fine, really.
- Thanks, though.
- Okay.
I'm gonna get some towels.
Okay.
Hey, we're out of towels and those shimmy things.
I will get some more.
Mind the money.
Caroline, help me.
Caroline.
Help me.
Help me.
- That'll be $20.
- Okay.
I saw you last night.
You were talking to a friend of mine.
At the Grill.
Well, I thought it was somebody I knew.
Stefan Salvatore.
No, it can't be.
It was just my mind playing tricks on me.
Where do you think you'd seen him before? When I first moved here, I stayed at the Salvatore boarding house.
Stefan was just passing through to visit his uncle.
I mean, none of us knew he was even here until the attack.
- The attack? - His uncle got killed.
Mauled by an animal in the woods.
His uncle? Zach? Mm-mm.
Joseph.
I'm sorry, sir, I don't think I'm familiar with the story.
How could you? I mean, this happened years ago.
Grandpa, you gotta go.
Mom wants you home.
Okay? He wasn't bugging you, was he? He's a little Alzy-heimer.
No, he was sweet.
Hey, sir, I'm sorry.
Are you sure that the man that you saw that you knew, his name was Stefan Salvatore? Yes.
I remember his ring and his brother.
- Damon? - Yeah.
Stefan and Damon Salvatore.
- When was this? - It was early June, 1953.
Yeah.
June, 1953.
I'll be back.
Caroline finally freed you, huh? Uh, I don't know where she went.
She abandoned me.
Hey, I realized earlier, I had no idea that your family was from Italy.
No? Last name Salvatore didn't do it for you? Right.
Duh.
Are there any other Salvatores in Mystic Falls? - My Uncle Zach.
- Where did everyone else go? - Kind of just spread out.
- Mm.
Why? I'm just trying to learn more about you.
Where are you taking me? We can't hide out in your room all the time.
Welcome to my other favorite party place.
What, the cemetery? Yeah.
It's cool, huh? - Yo, Vick.
- What's up, Jared? - You babysitting, Donovan? - This is Jeremy.
He's cool.
Smoke up.
Thanks.
- Your car was done an hour ago.
- You are saying that out loud, why? Hi.
Elena, right? I think I met you once when you were 9.
Your emotional maturity level when we were together.
Ouch.
I thought we were making progress.
Is he enough in your good graces that I can ask him for a favor? If I do her a favor, will I get back in your good graces? - A very reluctant "maybe" to both.
- Done.
Wait.
Dinner, tonight, your house.
Fine.
But you're eating leftovers.
Ooh.
What do you need? Do you have access to old news stories, say, '50s? At the station.
Between the archives and the Internet, we have everything.
I have this report, way past due.
You'd be a lifesaver.
I'm heading there now.
Let's go.
If anyone asks you don't know where I went.
I don't want Caroline to know that I left.
Caroline.
Help.
Caroline.
Damon? Damon? Damon? Oh, my God.
What is this? How did I know that you were here? Because I wanted you to.
Very, very badly.
Let me out of here.
Please.
- You bit me.
- You liked it.
Remember? Why do I keep remembering the same things, but in different ways? You remember what I want you to remember.
And now that the vervain has passed out of your system you won't remember what you're about to do.
What am I about to do? You're gonna open the door.
You're gonna open the door.
No.
Get out of here.
Now.
Run! Run.
- Sweeper duty.
- What? - We have to clean the pavement.
- It's a car wash.
- By definition, the pavement's clean.
- But not dry.
And I'm doing this, why? Caroline bailed, so that leaves me in charge.
Fabulous.
Somebody call the fire department.
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
Bonnie.
- Hey.
- What just happened? You were in some kind of a trance.
Did I do this? I think so, yeah.
Nobody else saw, did they? No? Don't tell anybody.
Please.
We digitized all our archives last year.
You can pull all the remote footage right up on-screen.
What is it exactly you're looking for? An incident from 1953, if it even happened at the old Salvatore boarding house.
- Sorry, one second.
Yeah? Fire? All right.
I'll be right there.
I gotta go.
You believe there's actual news to cover in this town? Use keywords to search the database.
It's pretty easy to navigate.
Brady, down in Tech, will help you out, anything you need.
- Okay.
- All right? Oh, hey.
Could you put in a good word for me with Jenna? - You got it.
- All right.
Good luck.
- What? - I'm stoned in a cemetery.
They don't mind.
They're dead.
You know what? I'm gonna take us up a notch.
Hey, Tony.
Nice.
Vickies from Vicki.
Ha! Oh, thank you, Elena Gilbert, whoever you are.
- You took those from the house? - She wasn't using it.
She's gonna notice if they're gone.
That's not cool.
- It's no big deal, Jer.
- Yeah, it kind of is, Vick.
Damn, dude.
- Vicki brought the party police.
- Shut up, Tony.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to make you mad.
What are we doing with a bunch of losers? Those are my friends.
They're waste-of-space, small-town lifers.
Yeah? What am I? - You're different, Vick.
- No, you are.
You're the kid with the big house who's acting out because his parents died.
Guess what, you'll get over it.
You'll pull yourself together, move on and one day tell your kids stories about your dark period growing up.
I'll still be waiting tables at the Grill, partying at the cemetery with a bunch of waste-of-space, small-town lifers.
Go home, Jeremy.
If I wanna feel like crap about myself, I'll just go back to Tyler.
Hey, have you seen Elena? No, not for a while.
- You think she went home? - Not sure.
- Thanks.
- Hey.
- Yeah? - I'm not saying this for you.
I'm saying it for her.
But she's big on trust.
So whatever you're holding back from her the more you try to hide it, the more she won't stop till she figures it out.
This is Franklin Fell reporting to you from the Salvatore boarding house where a brutal animal attack has ended in tragedy.
Hey, they're bringing out the body.
See if you can get closer.
Is that the nephew? I didn't see you at the car wash.
Left early.
Honey, are you okay? Anything you wanna talk about? Is it a boy thing? Mom, if I wanna talk boys, I'll call Dad.
At least he's successfully dating one.
Zach! Oh, God, no, Zach.
Dear diary.
I'm not a believer.
People are born, they grow old, and then they die.
That's the world we live in.
There's no magic, no mysticism, no immortality.
There is nothing that defies rational thought.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I know, dear.
Oh, Grams.
Logan? Logan? People are supposed to be who they say they are, and not lie or hide their true selves.
- What are you doing here? - Oh, hey, man.
Just looking for the bathroom.
It's not possible.
I'm not a believer.
I can't be.
But how can I deny what's right in front of me? Someone who never grows old.
Never gets hurt.
Oh, my God.
Your hand.
Is it deep? How bad is it? Someone who changes in ways that can't be explained.
Hey.
Um, are you okay? Your eye.
Your face.
Girls bitten.
- What is that What happened to you? - It's nothing.
Bodies drained of blood.
- Did she say what kind of animal it was? - She said it was a vampire.
Donovan? No, I'm good.
- Not it.
- Not it.
Not it.
Ha, ha! Vicki.
Hey, man, you okay? Come here.
Come here.
- Come here.
- You don't look good.
Come closer.
I have something I have to tell you.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
It's okay.
It's okay.
What are you? ripped by looxlike
