                    			Previously on "Prison Break": There's something about this guy. He knows where we're going, what we're thinking. It's a matter of time before he finds out about the money in Utah and our way into Mexico, everything. You can have an attorney present during questioning. Caroline, they're taking her in. Of course. I'll keep an eye on her. I did it, Dad. Just do as you're told. Otherwise, there will be consequences that will affect us all. My dad's an Air Force colonel. When I told him I was staying in a hotel with a guy that I maybe sort of liked he lost it. What're you doing here? Where's Maricruz? - She's with me. Just tell me where she is. - Hey, Fernando, slow down, man. I was trying to tell you the wedding is in Vegas. So which one of them it was it? - Might be scofield. Probably gonna find his brother in there too. Where to, sir? - Utah. This morning, authorities in Illinois issued an update on the escaped convicts,,, ,,, known, until now, as the Fox River Eight, chicago mob boss John Abruzzi,,, ,,, was gunned down outside a Washington, D, c, motel last night,,, ,,, after investigators received a tip from an informant, The other seven escapees are still at large and considered dangerous, A Florida man wanted in I didn't think Abruzzi'd be the first to eat it. I have a feeling we're in for lots of surprises. They said seven are still out there. So much for faking our deaths. I bought us some time. That's what counts. How much further? - Seventy, 80 miles. Means we should be hitting Double-K Ranch by this afternoon. We could keep driving, pick up L.J. And hit Panama. We can't hit Panama. We can't hit anything. We can't do anything without the money. We need to find Charles' stash. I know some other guys who are thinking the same thing. The money is buried under a silo at the Double-K Ranch just outside of Tooele, Utah. There's $5 million there. Tickets. You know, when I was in Cheyenne, I pulled my ticket out of the bag. It tore in half, and I have no idea what happened to the other part. They didn't issue you a replacement? - No. The young lady, I think her name was sherry she actually said that this half was okay because the barcode was on it. Well, you really need the whole ticket. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid. She said everything would be fine because That's okay. It'll do for now. But make sure you ask for a replacement when you get to Provo. I definitely will. Thank you. It's always something, huh? - Oh, God, I know. I don't wanna go home. I wish we could keep driving. I don't think your pops will be down for that. Wouldn't it be fun? We could go to Hawaii. No, you can't drive to Hawaii. - I know. I know. I'm just saying, I wish. No, don't get it. They'll leave. - Just let me see who it is. It's a cop. No, no, no. Sorry to disturb you, ma'am. Have you happened to see this person? Last night, we got a few phone calls that he was spotted in the area. So we're going door to door. Why are you looking for him? He escaped from prison in Illinois a couple of days ago. Have you seen him? No. He doesn't look familiar. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure. All right. Thanks for your time. This ain't This is not what you think, all right? Look, trust me. Just listen, okay? All I did was steal a baseball card, okay? I'm not like those other fools up in there. I'm gonna go for a walk, okay? I'm gonna leave my keys right here. And when I come back, my car will be gone. I'm sure in a few hours, they'll find it somewhere abandoned. Wait, wait. I wish it could be different. I have to go. Tooele. - I think it's "Tooele." Hell of a town. - Small is good. Means the ranch'll be easier to find. All we gotta do is get that money and be out of here by nightfall. - Nice. Oh, sir. Soil tests came back from scofield's crash. Not that you need any more proof, but he really went out of his way this time. What else do you have? A man was assaulted in Nebraska by a hitchhiker matching Bagwell's description. He was headed west on the I-80. Omaha's putting together a photo lineup. What do you have on scofield? What does anybody have on scofield? I've got some results from his hard drive. The one recovered from the river. We were able to use the sector editor to restore the master boot. So from that I don't care how you did it. What do you have? More than half the contents of the buffer. About 60 percent. It looks pretty random. - Print it up, all of it. I want it on my desk. Well, guess what. No listing for a Double-K Ranch. Excuse me. You know where I might find the Double-K Ranch? What'd you call it? - Double-K Ranch. No. - You from around here? Yeah. Born and raised. There's no double nothing. Great. Thank you. Looks like Westmoreland spent his last breath blowing smoke up your ass. There's one way to find out. The county keeps property records. Every plot is mapped out with dimensions. It's public record. But if there is a tax assessor's office here it's gonna be in there. In the municipal building. Lot of cops in there, Michael. Dispatch, - Someone,,,, Someone stole my car this morning, I'm at the Lotus Motel off Interstate 80, Did you see who took it? - No, I went out for a walk, And when I came back, it was gone, - This morning? Why didn't you call before? I don't know, Mr. Kellerman. - Mr. Kim. Surprised to see you in Chicago. - Just looking for updates. Sara Tancredi. I'm on it. Is pursuing her the best use of your time? - It is. She's in contact with scofield. I was there when he called yesterday. We stay with her, she takes us right to him, he takes us to Burrows. All right. Lf you're that confident. - I am. I'll let the president know. - I contact the president directly. I'll contact her. Keep me posted. If you wanna restore dignity, you need to take action, Making amends requires much more than saying, "I'm sorry," It means learning to change. The apology's just the first step. The most important thing is that you display honesty courage and compassi√≥n when you extend your apologies. You need to earn your forgiveness. We'll talk about it more on Friday. I got a great idea. - What's that? Since you are such a fan of lame, store-bought blueberry pie I'm gonna bake you a real pie of your choice tonight. I can't. I really don't need to be seeing anyone right now who isn't my therapist. I've been a hermit lately too. My partner Daniel's away on business. I've been sitting around every night by myself. Kind of pathetic. I'm so sorry. I thought you meant I thought The pie - oh, no. No, I was really talking about - Pie? Yeah, actual blueberries. Like we'd make pie and watch Fried Green Tomatoes. I get it. I get it. - I'm the best ex-junkie cook in this town. Thank you. I just I gotta clean my apartment. It's disgusting. I realize that sounds like an excuse. It's not. - No, no, no, I get it. You do what you gotta do. Have a good night. You deliver? Next batch. Just put it on the desk. Any of this stuff mean anything? - I don't know. Ask me later. Is he a genius or a whack job? We answered that when we assigned 100 agents. So why don't you go get me the rest of it? Does that work for you? Alackaday. I just found me an in-betweener. Where you going in such a hurry? - None of your beeswax, yo. I know where. The same place as every other man that was in that room that night. They all coming around here for a big family reunion at the Ku Klux Ranch. If they ain't here already. There ain't no fool in this town ever heard of the Double-K Ranch. It seems like you been misinformed. There is a Double-K. It's just a matter of who gets there first. The stars are gonna collide in Tooele. You'll need me on your side. This ain't Fox River, all right? I don't need any As you can see I need you. Get your grubby paws off me, you freak. I ain't your ditch digger. I don't need nothing from you. I don't need nothing. You might. If a man knew where he was supposed to be looking Hi, Are you having the Hector Avila and Maricruz Delgado wedding today? Avila. No? Thanks. Hi. Are you having the Hector Avila and Maricruz Delgado wedding today? Avila. Delgado. Really? When? Stay calm. We'll be out of here in 10 minutes. One at a time. Clear. Back up. You wearing a watch? Yeah. Nice day. Thanks. This is exactly what we need. It's a map of every parcel of land. Topography, buildings, everything. Karl Kokosing. Double-K. I don't like the way this guy's looking at us. Twelve-thirteen. Where's 1213? Hey, seifert. I need to speak with you. - Come on, man. We gotta roll now. Hey, seifert. - Come on. You got the map? No. Someone else does. Someone got here before us. It's the only explanation. Son of a bitch is still alive. Hey, pretty. - What the? What you gonna do, scream? How the hell are you still breathing? What the hell'd you do to your hand? Easy, easy. I recently had some work done. Where's the map? Easy, easy, easy. I don't have it. Well, where is it? - I'm telling you, I don't have it. Don't have it, huh? - You were there. We saw you. It was gone. Why don't you keep your pooch away from me? I'll tell you everything I know. It's the kid. He has it. I saw him this morning. I needed some help. We made a deal, all right? He said that he would dig. I told him where we could get a map at. What kid? What kid? The best thing to do is nothing. That's how I'll get the U.s. Senate to confirm my vice-presidency? Do nothing? - Shows them you can do the job. Wait a minute. It's my daughter. Sir, we need to talk about your daughter. What about her? Well, the media is all over this Fox River situation. We think it would be best if you could distance yourself from her If I hear this one more time I paid her bail. I walked away. I have distanced myself. Give me a minute. Hey, Dad, it's me. When you get a chance, I really need to talk to you about some things. Actually, a lot of things. The most important one is that I owe you an apology. I realize that I've made things difficult for you lately. And I wanna take responsibility for that. Call me back. Bye. Hi. I know I'm early, but I brought dinner. - Come on in. You're not a vegetarian, are you? - No. Just shut that behind you. Do you mind if I check my e-mail? - No, not at all. Here. Oh, you're so kind. Thank you. - Absolutely. Do you happen to have a pen handy? - Yeah. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry to bother you. No, look, I have a little pencil and pad. - Thank you. Sir. Sir. - Yeah? No sherry in Cheyenne. Your ticket is not valid for travel. Oh, well, hold on, now. That can't be right. That can't be right. Excuse me for a second. - Sure. All right, now, listen, brother, I'm gonna give it to you straight up. Seriously, I don't I'm broke, okay? Now, that's the truth. Now, I just ran into some trouble a while back. I'm just trying to pull it all together now. You understand? Well, you can tell that to the authorities in about five minutes. Come on, brother, we don't have to get the authorities It's too late. They're already waiting at the next stop. These guys here are gonna sit with you until we stop. I understand. I understand. Hey! - Come here. Sir. - Hey, you can't go in there. Oh, my goodness. Okay, we've got a confirmed sighting on Franklin. He jumped out of a moving train in Preston, Idaho. What is a black man from Chicago doing in Idaho? He's gotta be lost. Franklin's in Preston, Bagwell's in Nebraska. Both men have never been across the Mississippi. Visiting friends and family? I don't think so. And not south of the border. They're due west, and we need to know why. Out. What's going on? - Where'd you say Tweener was headed? Up on the main drag. He's supposed to find a shovel. In. - No. No, no, no. - In. You're coming back, right? You're coming back? Yep. - Hey, you guys. Hey. Come on, man. I'm boiling up in here. I was on my ATV and I was hauling ass. I was right on her tail. I pulled out my gun and that bitch treed herself. And I brought her down in one shot. What'd she weigh? - At least a hunny. Maybe 110. - Come on out and see us if you want. It's gonna be a good time. - Yeah, I just might do that. Hey, now. What you digging? Some stuff in my grandpa's yard. I got a bigger one in the back if you're going deep. No, this'll do. Damn it if I don't know you from somewhere. Maybe I know your grandpa. Doubt it, man. He moved here like a month ago so What's his name? His name's Grandpa, all right? Can you just ring this up? I gotta get out of here. - Sure thing, fella. I'll ring it up. I'll ring it right now. I know where I've seen you. On TV. You're one of them Fox River boys. You got it wrong, man. - No, I think I got it right. We're closed. Sorry, bud. We're closing up early today. Hey, hold on. Stay right there. You're going down just like your buddy, you son of a bitch. Where's the kid? Where's the kid? - He's back here. Get up. Come on, tough guy. Let's go. Maricruz? Baby, open up. It's me. It's me, okay? Fernando, what are you doing here? You can't be here. I know. Where's your sister? I need to see her. She's getting her picture taken with my mom and dad. The wedding's at 2:30. - I need to see her now. You have to go. - She's the mother of my kid, Theresa. Please. You don't want her to marry Hector, do you? Do you? I'll go see if I can go get her. Wait in here. - Okay. Lance, I got a question for you. - Yes? You know who I am? I happened to see the news last night, yes. Hey, I don't care. I've got some skeletons in my closet too. One of whom wears a dress. Thank you. I appreciate your lack of judgment. From what I can tell, you didn't do anything wrong. But it's none of my business, and you don't need to talk about it. The whole thing just I never meant for it to happen. Okay, you do not need to answer this question. But were you and that guy, like? You're right, I don't wanna talk about it. You're done? - Yeah. Does it worry you that he's out there? Give me one second. Dad. - Sara, hi. I got your message. Please, come in. Lance, this is my father, Frank. How do you do? - Dad, this is my friend, Lance. Pleasure to meet you, sir. And I voted for you. Thank you. I appreciate that. Sara, I can take off. - No need. Only take a minute. You step into my office. And you make yourself at home. Sure. So so in my program, we've been talking a lot about making amends. And I've been thinking a lot about About some of the choices I've made lately. And I know that that affects you. And I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. Well, you don't have to say you're sorry. - Yeah, I do. And it must be hard to understand why I did it. I had no idea that I was putting these guys back out on the street. I thought I was saving the life of an innocent man. And I know that you didn't read the information I gave you on Lincoln Burrows, but he is innocent and a lot of the people involved right now are dead. I'm sorry. This isn't why I called you. I'm fine. But I'm scared. Sara. I'm gonna help you through this. We're gonna get through this together. Thank you. - I promise. Kellerman. - We ran that trace you requested, What'd you get? - The line is disconnected, And whose was it? - Apparently no one, What does that mean? - It's been out of service for 17 years, Fernando. Where is she? - Now, calm down. Calm down. She's gonna come down and talk to you. She's on her way down right now. You and I got history. We're family. Out of respect for that, I'm gonna let her make her own decisi√≥n. I'm not leaving without her. - That's for Maricruz to decide. You've been filling her head with this crap. - She's a smart girl. I personally don't think she's gonna wanna live her life on the run. We'll see. - You know she doesn't love you. I don't wanna get into that right now. - You're not raising my kid. That don't sound good, cuz. Maricruz? Baby? Where is she? - You have to go. Where is she? - Please. They're coming. Did you tell her I was here? Did you? Maricruz. Mahone. I'll be right down. Mr. Mahone. - Where are they? I had a hard time getting my hands on these. Be easier to go to a doctor. You need something to calm your nerves. Doctors take notes. That's why I have a deal with you. The way things have been going, I thought our deal was over. You don't ask me about shales no more. - That part is over. I no longer need an informant on the case. I thought that's all you cared about, was finding him. Can't get them all. - I can keep an ear out on the street Midazolam, 1500 milligrams every 30 days. That's all I want from you. We understand each other? You gonna pay me for it? Right there. What are you doing here? - We had to come for you, buddy. How'd you know? - T-Bag. Hand over the map. What? - The map. Hand it over. He told you I had it? We are gonna sort this out right now. Tell me that's not what I know it is. It is. But don't worry. Before I destroyed it, I committed it to my photographic memory. Coming from a compulsive liar, I find that hard to believe. I'd have tattooed it to my body, but I didn't have the time. Whenever you strip-search a lifer, you should always check his coin purse. Tell us where the money is. Now, let's not dissolve into threats, all right? I'm gonna take the high road here. Suggest a mutually beneficial arrangement. I have the information. You have the manual requirements necessary to unearth Westmoreland's buried booty. We're partners. - And why is that? Because as of this moment, I'm your map. So then, yo, we split it four ways, right? Wrong. Get in. You're not worth 1.5. Get in. - Okay. Excuse me. Can I help you? Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah. It's hot. I was really wondering how much you're selling your RV for. Probably out of your price range. - Come on. Give me a shot. Forty thousand dollars. Look, I tell you what. I'll be back in a couple of days, okay? I can't hold it for you. I said I'll be back. With cash. Nice bike. The wedding's at 2:30, Fernando, We just got confirmation on Fernando sucre. He was in Las Vegas around 2. Then a gas station attendant spotted a guy on a bike matching his description in Mesquite an hour later. Out west. Just like Bagwell and Franklin. Yeah, but he was heading east and Bagwell's in Nebraska on I-80 heading west and Franklin's train was heading west, but he jumped off to the You know D.B. Cooper? - Yeah, the hijacker. But he was never found. - But he's gotta be somewhere. Someone hijacked that plane in Portland and jumped out over the Pacific Northwest and someone was arrested two days later in Bisbee, Arizona. Not the same guy. - Same guy. Same guy who was treated for a broken knee at a free clinic somewhere around salt Lake City. Same guy whose Nova blew a head gasket 10 miles short of the border. Same guy who almost got away with a stolen car but he ran a woman down in Bisbee. Vehicular manslaughter. Arrested and booked as Charles Westmoreland. But he didn't have the money on him. Which means he got rid of it somewhere along the way. This is fact? You figured all this out? - No, scofield did. That's why he was bringing the old man. The money's in Utah. And they're all going to get it. You know, in Thailand, they got a black market where you can get any surgery you need, even a hand transplant. You're sick, you know that? Keep going. The turnoff's just up here somewhere. Before or after sheep Road? What's the matter? Did you forget? How could I forget a road called sheep? It's after. Don't you feel all warm inside now that we're working together? We aren't working together. You're just here to lend a hand. Wait, wait, slow down. That was it. That little bitty road right back there. How far is it from here? A quarter mile, if I remember the scale properly. Let's start walking. Frank? - Yeah, I'm almost ready. What time did you say the flight was? - Eight. Listen, I hope you get this nomination more than anyone, but be prepared. This Burrows thing may steamroll. Well, we'll wait it out, just like you said. - Problem is too many headlines. His lawyer, Nick savrinn, is already dead. His kid's awaiting trial for double homicide and now his lead counsel is classified as missing. Well, is she missing or is she dead? I just thought you should know before you go to Washington. Bruce, is there something connecting all of this? It's probably best you don't ask a whole lot of questions. Where now? Right up there. The hill borders the property. The K.K. Is on the other side. First thing I'm gonna do with the money: Buy new shoes. - Second thing, tacos. Third thing, ice-cold beer. Fourth thing, a little toothpaste. Mahone. - Agent Mahone, your car's out front, sir, The flight to Utah leaves in an hour, - I'll be there. Thank you. Ninth thing, a shower. Tenth thing, a good night's sleep. - A nice hotel. Clean sheets. Look, stakes marking the property line. Should be dead ahead. Can you see the silo? The bastards built over it. It's gone.
