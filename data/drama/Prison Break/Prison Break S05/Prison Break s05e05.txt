Contingency



                    			1 Kaniel Outis. He's been working with ISIL.  You know that's not Michael.  We're gonna need you.  I can rest when I'm dead.  That's what I'm worried about.  I'm not leaving Michael.  We can't risk all of it for just one man.  ISIL has broken through the checkpoint.  Sana'a is falling.  We work together or we both die.  You have my word.  It's Abu Ramal that Poseidon wants free.  [shouts.]  KELLERMAN: Poseidon sent you?  Enough!  [shouts.]  [man groaning.]  Who the hell is this guy?  - He's my brother. - Back at the prison  I had to deny who you were. They were filming me,  and they can't know.  SID: Abu Ramal has been martyred.  The entire army of ISIL  just declared war on us.  Behold the villain.  [cell phone rings.]  Hi.  Hey. I, uh, I ran into town to get some coffee.  - Do you want anything? - No. I'm good.  Thanks, honey. I'm almost done here.  I will see you at the lake in a little while, okay?  Okay. I'll see you back at the house.  The hubby?  Uh, what did you learn from Kellerman?  There's no easy way to deliver this news, darling.  It's a heartbreaker.  Doesn't get any better.  He's rotten all the way to the core.  You've been sleeping with the enemy, baby.  I don't understand.  I followed them two monkeys from Kellerman's house  right after they put a bullet in him.  Needless to say he wasn't our guy.  [laughs.]  He did say some pretty alarming things  about your boy, Poseidon, the world shaker.  Didn't give me enough to put all the pieces together.  Back up, back up, back up. What did they say?  Jacob? His words?  I couldn't get close enough to hear much, but what I did  what I did hear was your name and Michael's.  Yes, they seemed pretty cozy,  - the three of them. - Oh, my God.  It's a nasty bag of conspir Where are you going?!  To my son!  Stay down. Stay down.  It's another artillery strike.  LINCOLN: But they sure as hell are used to it.  Go, go!  [crowd chanting in Arabic.]  [speaking Arabic.]   [crowd shouting.]  [crowd chanting in Arabic.]    CROWD: Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar.  Allahu Akbar.      [crowd boos, shouts.]    [man speaking in Arabic.]   SID: ISIL just offered ten million for our heads!  Wait. Wait. Stay here.  We got to get off these streets or we're dead.  Ten million rial?  You give up your mother  for cash like that.  It's about what I paid  for Freddie Mercury's ashes.  Freddie Mercury now, really?  It's better than talking about 500,000 people  looking to kill us.  Come on.  Found a place to figure out next steps.  Let's go.  This is the part you tell me what's going on,  the whole thing.  No. Th-There's no time.  Country's about to fall.  You'll get your answers, I promise.  Right now our window is closing.  We need to  We need to pivot to the next contingency.  - Train station. - Get up to the north.  Exit the country that way.  Things have changed in the four years  you've been locked up in Ogygia, Michael.  Your plan's redundant.  ISIL control the north, roads, checkpoints, train stations.  Even if we make it across the city, it's suicide.  No. You're wrong. It's a shell game.  You go where they never expect you.  Wait. You came all the way to Yemen looking for him.  You think he was lost or something?  Come on.  You want to live?  The airport's the only option.  The airport's known as the main artery to the outside world.  It's the first thing ISIL will shut down.  Planes were flying an hour ago. You got a phone?  No, but he does.  Burned it up jacking off to Queen, though.  Guilty as charged.  C-Note's organizing a passage on the flight as we speak.  MICHAEL: No, I'm telling you,  my plan will work.  Once once you leave  the northern part of Sana'a  Enough. We shouldn't even be talking about this.  MICHAEL: Get off me!  How are you alive?!  In Yemen?!  What happened to you, Michael?!  Now, I'm not moving another inch until you tell me  what the hell is really going on here.     Michael Scofield had to die.  I had to fake my death.  Go away.  It was part of the deal I made.  If I went to work for a deep-cover operative  named Poseidon  we would all go free.  We were free.  We were exonerated.  No. That's what we thought  but we were wrong.  A few weeks before I married Sara  I was approached by Poseidon.  You think I'm showing?  I'm not used to that yet.  I got to I got to tell Michael.  Here you go. Burgers will  - be just a second. - Hello?  Yes, this is Michael.  Poseidon told me Kellerman didn't have  the authority or jurisdiction to exonerate our crimes.  He used that as a legal fulcrum.  Told me he could put us all away for life  within the mandate of the law unless  unless I went to work for him.  What the hell can they be talking about  at a time like this?  I don't know  but big brother's hearing things I want to hear.  SID: We cannot stay.  We must go now.  Maybe we don't.  What the hell are you talking about?  Maybe all this running  is just delaying the inevitable.  Die alone here. Die alone at home.  God, you need a girlfriend, man.  [men shouting.]  Those voices are heading our way. They're almost on us.  Who the hell is this Poseidon guy?  A psychopath.  A frustrated policy wonk in the CIA  who felt he could do better than his superiors.  So, he created a cell within the CIA called 21-Void,  implementing his own intelligence operations.  And he needed my help  breaking out people imprisoned all over the world.  Terrorists,  political dissidents  rogue agents  and if I did it, you and Sara, you'd go free.  Your record's expunged,  but there was a rub.  I wasn't allowed to have contact with any of you,  including my son.  Michael.  So, Michael Scofield was dead and  over the years I assumed many names.  Kaniel Outis the most recent.  Why didn't you tell me?  Why didn't you reach out to me?  I didn't have a choice.  Poseidon made that very clear.  How?  At first, I said no.  I wouldn't do it.  Then within weeks, Sara was incarcerated, beaten.  And so I gave in.  Everything I did, I did for family,  for you, for Sara,  for Mike so none of you would ever have to spend another day  inside a prison cell or or live a life on the run.  Look at us now.  [crash above.]  They're starting to search the buildings.  - Train station. - Airport.  Train station.  [people clamoring.]  GATE ATTENDANT: All passengers must present a ticket.  All passengers must present a ticket.  Never gonna get to our seats. We need to go through there.  Even the pilot can't get on the plane.  C-NOTE: This is an airport full of planes.  - There's got to be others. - It's no good.  People will die here today.  We need another option.  - My man, Omar. - Omar?  That slippery brother?  Trust is a luxury right now.  He can be trusted. To a point. He has connections on  - the western coast, across the desert. - No.  Lincoln and Michael are coming here. That's the plan.  They don't have a next move if we leave.  Now they're out there somewhere, God knows where.  Your friends are too late. Look around you.  This airport is no good to them.  We're not leaving.  [gunfire in the distance.]  What is that place?  Where the westerners went  when they made their escape.  I ran into one at the Forger's Den.  I can help.  And how do you expect to find the foreigners  with only one eye?  [car engine starts.]  [tires screech, woman screams.]  They're here. ISIL are here!  [crowd clamoring.]  C-NOTE: Come on, come on. I have an idea.  The pilot.  Okay, follow me. Follow me!  Don't lose him. Don't lose the pilot.  C-NOTE: Come on. Come on, come on.  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  No, just stay down.  [guns cock, crowd clamoring.]  Okay. Wait here.  - What? - I'll be back.  - Benjamin - I'm going alone.  Don't do it.  [soft gasp.]  [engine revving.]  - [tires screech.] - ISIL SOLDIER: Halt!  What are you doing here?  - On your knees! - Halt!  Come out. Come out.  Who are you? Papers.  - Don't shoot. Don't shoot. - Papers.  SHEBA: Infidels!  The infidels are in the airport.  The killers of Ramal! I've seen them with my own eyes.  - What? - I want my reward.  The ten million rial. I will be rich.  - ISIL SOLDIER: Take us to them. - Not until you promise  I will get my ten million rial.  If you speak the truth, you'll have the money.  [grunting.]  [ISIL solider choking.]  You kick a lot of ass for a good Muslim.  You can take the man out of the streets,  but you can't take the streets of the man.  PILOT: Why do you help me? Who are you?  I'm a man, just like you,  trying to get out of this madness,  but we're not gonna get out through those gates.  The only way out now  is up, brother.  The 747 is done.  It's been secured by the rebels.  I'm not talking about Yemenia Air.  I have my eyes  on a different set of wings.  [door opens.]  - Mom? - Hey.  JACOB'S FATHER: Sara!  You scared us.  - Sorry. - Is everything all right?  Yeah, no, It's fine. I just it's been a crazy day,  made more so by the fact that I forgot Mike's Spanish lesson.  - MIKE: Spanish? - SARA: Yeah.  - That's not today. - We're gonna talk about it in the car, okay?  Are you sure? Is everything okay?  SARA: Really. Yes. We're fine. Thank you.  Well, let me get Mike's bag.  No, no, don't worry about it. I'll get it tomorrow.  I want you to get in the car and no matter what  - You don't get out, okay? - Hey, hey, hey! Where you going so fast?  Get in.  Thank you.  How was that department meeting yesterday?  You usually meet with killers?  Sara. Sara. Please, please, please.  I can explain, okay? Just listen to me.  I was sick with worry.  I needed to protect you, to-to protect our family,  so I picked up your phone from the shop  and I took it to Andrew Nelson,  my buddy in the computer sciences department.  He did a deep dive,  some kind of data archaeology, and he did it.  He tracked those bastards down.  Got their cell information.  So so I called them,  thinking I could-I could maybe  - make a-make a deal with them. - You called them.  Sara?  Sara, please, listen to me.  Sara, this was for you.  You're gonna want to get out of the way right now.  Sara. Sara!  MICHAEL: This is it.  Our ticket out of the country.  LINCOLN: I'm telling you, Michael, this is a bad idea.  ISIL are everywhere.  MICHAEL: No, I can do this.  You really paid the equivalent of ten million rial  for some dude's ashes?  Not just any ashes, man.  Freddie Mercury's ashes.  I would've paid twice that.  MICHAEL: Come on.  Keep your head down.  I think it's time we get sane and head to the airport.  No, no, no.  This is better. They control the station.  They'll never think to look for us here now.  They're repurposing those trains for cargo,  not passengers.  Once we're on, it's  it's a straight shot to the north.  They won't check the cars again.  That's what you see when you see the train?  I see a bunch of dudes with AK-47s  who don't look a thing like us. You really believe  we can survive 300 miles on a train  through ISIL territory?  Now that's suicide.  It does seem risky. No kidding.  No, no.  We get in that line of cargo carriers. Keep our heads down.  Once we're on the train, lay low the rest of the trip.  Besides, we don't need to look like them.  Tell the believing men to lower their gaze  and be modest.  Come on.  From the Koran.  CYCLOPS: All the roads are blocked.  So you'll have to find a different way to the border.  [gasps.]  By train!  Heather, what now?  What now?  I mean, it was all a lie.  Wasn't it? Everything.  Our whole life, our whole marriage.  He was standing as close as you were to me right now,  and he was chatting with the woman who shot him.  You're saying he planned to get himself shot  like it was some sort of, uh, sick performance?  I don't know. I don't know.  I mean, I  - Yes. Yes, it was. - But he almost died.  So, the plan was to wing him, right?  To just put him above suspicion, but the shot went wide.  He gets hit.  - He knows that he's married to a doctor. - Sara, Sara, stop. Stop.  You haven't slept in three days, right?  You're upset about the home invasion  and you're tying yourself up in knots  because the love of your life,  the father of your baby, might be alive.  [voice breaking.]: And I can't get through to Lincoln.  But I saw that video.  It's him.  - Okay, and I - That's Michael.  And I believe you. I do.  And that matters.  That's all that matters.  No, I know.  But Jacob is a good man.  - He's your husband. - [phone ringing.]  - Yeah. - And he helped you start a new life.  Together.  And that's him.  - I have to answer it. - No. No.  - No, you don't. - Leave a message and we'll get back.  [answering machine beeps.]  JACOB: Heather, Heather? Is Sara there?  Please, I-I need to speak with her.  Look, there's been a huge misunderstanding  and I can explain everything.  Will you just Will you tell her that?  And to call me?  He's tracking me.  Oh, Sara, honey. I'm your best friend.  Of-of course he's gonna call here first.  It doesn't make him Deep Throat.  Listen,  let's just see if there's a simpler explanation.  Hmm?  Okay.  What was the name of that computer tech that he mentioned?  Uh Andrew.  Nelson. Andrew Nelson.  Okay, well, I have an old friend in that department.  We can find out  if Jacob's full of it in one call.  Okay.  [indistinct conversations.]  [man speaking Arabic.]     [Sid speaks Arabic.]       [grunting, men shouting.]  [woman yelling.]  [gun cocks.]  [gunfire.]  [shouting in Arabic.]  [train horn blaring.]  Get on the other side of that train!  WHIP: Come on, come on, come on,  come on, come on!  [train horn blaring.]  MICHAEL: Come on, let's go.  [camera shutter clicks.]  [phone rings.]  What do you want?  Look at the picture I just sent you.  I can see the murderers now.  Where?  Not so fast.  Bring your weapons, I will stay on them.  And I call the shots now.  PILOT: We checked. There's enough fuel to get us out of Yemen.  [speaks Arabic.]  C-NOTE: Question is, can you fly an old bird like this?  PILOT: We'll find out.  [men yelling in Arabic.]  [yelling continues.]  MICHAEL: There's another station,  30 miles outside Sana'a.  We can find a way there, hop a train.  They won't anticipate us coming that way.  Doubling down on a bad bet.  Just like you did  seven years back with the CIA.  Look around you.  Your plans affect people, you don't even see it.  I don't blame you for resenting me.  You're damn right I resent you.  I see it, Linc. I see it.  Every second of every day,  the people, the collateral damage,  the lives I've affected.  [engine turning over.]  But I can't start thinking about that.  Because if I do,  then it all falls apart  and none of us get to go home.  I have to stay focused,  be the man with the plan.  Just like Fox River.  - [engine revving.] - Remember?  We got wheels.  MICHAEL: Good work.  The airport's the only play.  The airport is five miles away.  The border is hundreds.  Look,  the airport might be the right choice,  but I trust my instincts.  They've gotten us this far.  And my gut says  we can still make it out through the north. Choice is yours.  - [SUV door closes.] - WHIP: Look, man,  I agree with you, even if I don't know you from Adam.  But  got to go with the horse  that got you here, you know? So  he's my horse.  Craziest horse I've ever met.  But got us this far.  LINCOLN: Crazy only works  if it doesn't get you killed.  [SUV door closes.]  [SUV door closes.]    - [door opens.] - HEATHER: Andrew?  Uh, Professor Hayden told us to speak with you?  ANDREW: Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, right.  Sorry.  Uh, hi, Andrew.  I'm Sara Scofield.  Thanks for taking the time.  By any chance,  did my husband Jacob Ness ask you to work on my cell phone?  Yeah, he did, uh, yesterday.  What did he, uh  What did he ask you to do?  Uh, he said he was looking to find the contact information  for the people who were stalking his wife.  So I did a data dive and gave him what I could find.  How?  They hacked your phone and lifted the data,  but in the process, left a very slight electronic signature  that I was able to track back to them.  Wait, who are "they"?  Don't know. It was a dummy IP address,  but the cell and location were correct.  They couldn't hide that from me.  [phone rings.]  [sighs, scoffs.]  The man himself.  [phone continues ringing.]  [phone beeps.]  Hello.  Sara, listen, I know you're upset,  but I need you to come to the Whitney Heights police station,  right now.  Please.  So, now we got some time to talk.  Um  Well, your name's Michael.  Cool.  You have a brother.  What else don't I know?  Serious, I need to know. I've been traveling so fast,  for so long, I didn't even stop to think who you really are  or what we're real doing here.  I don't even know why  you dragged me into all this, you know?  You got to forget the past, Whip, the details.  None of that matters now.  What have my actions been all these years?  Who's been taking care of you  through everything, huh?  Me. Right?  Right?  Yeah.  Nothing changes.  You're still my whip hand  Whip hand, yeah, I know, I'm your whip hand.  It's it's not good enough this time, man.  Can you just give it to me straight?  You know, I'm a big boy, I can handle it.  There's a reason you're my whip hand.  A reason that's gonna change your life.  There's a light at the end of the tunnel for you.  [all grunting, gasping.]  LINCOLN: What the hell was that?  WHIP: Oh, son of a bitch.  LINCOLN: We got to go.  Let's go!  [speaking Arabic.]  [shouting in Arabic.]  - There's no way out. - WHIP: Back of the hospital's  been shelled to rubble. It's blocked.  Upstairs is blocked, too.  We're gonna go downstairs.  Look for a way out.  You do the same.  Thanks.  What's going on?  Sara, just  just come with us.  You'll see. Please.  Hello, ma'am. Um, Sara Scofield?  Yes, sir.  Thanks for coming in, I'm Detective Kennan.  We'd like you to point out who broke into your home.  And  the one who shot your husband.  It's three and four.  The man and the woman was the shooter.  Are you sure?  Yes, sir.  Yes, I'm absolutely sure.  There's got to be a way out.  Something something that connects to the surface.  Going down's not gonna work, Michael.  We need to set up an ambush and fight.  Yeah, well, fighting is your default setting.  It's not always about fists.  JA: I'm telling you, there's no way out.  WHIP: Then find something to fight with, you idiot.  I don't think it's that kind of a party,  but I like your style.  What are you going to do with that?  I don't know.  Beats a fist.  We are the champions   My friends   And we'll keep on fighting   WHIP: Rubbing alcohol?  What the hell are you doing?  Till the end   You'll go blind, you idiot.  JA: It's only 95% alcohol.  I'll only go 95% blind.  the champions   No time for losers   'Cause we   There. There's an air shaft.  [grunts.]  [grunting continues.]  [men shouting above.]  [shouting in Arabic.]  Well, it's about fists now.  We are the champions   [door opens.]  Michael?  No. It's them.  My first lover was much older than me.  He was my friend's father.  Massi was his name.  [chuckles softly.]  It was the greatest of scandals  that we kept to ourselves.  But his wife discovered us  and told her brothers.  Massi was taken into the desert  and buried.  Alive.  They brought his eyes to me in a rag.  I need you to use that on me.  End my suffering.  What, this?  SID: Ja's right. All this running is pointless.  Do you know what they will do to me here,  away from seeing eyes?  I can't.  [inhales.]  I won't let that happen.  Do you understand?  I won't let that happen.  Listen. Sid.  I'm not giving up.  And queer or no, you're not, either.  They're in the wrong.  Not you.  WHIP: What are you gonna do with that?  I've paid my dues   Time after time   I've served my sentence   But committed no crime   [Michael grunts, bangs.]  LINCOLN: Michael, come on.  I'm sorry, Linc.  [sniffles.]  I should have come to you.  I should've asked for your help  when Poseidon offered me the deal. I blew it.  At the time, I thought,  if I dealt with it myself, the pain would only be mine.  But instead I opened this Pandora's Box.  I wanted to make it better, but I only made it worse  for everyone.  And somewhere in there  I became a ghost.    I made a lot of mistakes.  A lot of foolish, imperfect choices,  but every one of them  every one of them I made for love.  I know. I know.  Michael,  you're the smartest person I've ever known,  but you can't carry the load on your shoulders alone.  You need to share the burden.  Yes.  That's family.  That's what family's for.  Sara, I don't know what you thought, but  I'm just a husband who was worried about his wife.  And yeah, I-I should have told you what I was doing, but  Look, I felt like like everything was spiraling  out of control and I had to do whatever I could to protect you.  So you thought you'd contact two hired killers?  I was trying to play the white knight.  [chuckles.] Not very well.  And it was insanity.  I was scared to death.  A-A blubbering idiot,  but I thought they would respond to money, you know?  Pay them whatever it took to make them go away.  More than they were already making:  $50,000.  Look, I, uh  I had a tracker in it, Sara.  This little thing, but they didn't touch it.  [chuckles softly.]  I contacted the police before the meet,  but we nailed them anyhow.  We nailed them.  Jacob.  I am so sorry I put you through this.  Let's do this.  A wrench and a pipe against AKs.  It'll be fun.  I've always wanted a crack at these bastards.  [speaking in Arabic.]  JA [echoing.]:  I paid my dues   [muttering.]  Time after time   I've served my sentence   [whispering.]: Come back.  But committed no crime   And bad mistakes   WHIP: Get over here  I've made a few   You're gonna get yourself killed!  I've had my share   Of sand kicked in my face   But I've come through   And I go on and on and on   [footsteps approaching.]  We are the champions   - [guns clicking.] -  My friends   [shouting in Arabic.]  [screaming.]  We are the champions   We are the champions   [door opens.]  WHIP: I love you, you crazy Japanese son of a bitch!  It's Korean, champ.  Whatever. I still love you.  ISIL are like roaches.  More will be here soon.  What do we do now?  I need to take a break from making decisions.  Linc, airport?  Airport.  [phone ringing.]  Hey.  LINCOLN: I got someone I want you to talk to.  Hey.  [laughing.]: Oh, man!  Now that's a voice I never thought I'd hear again.  Man, you got some explaining to do, brother,  - risen from the dead and all. - Soon.  Where can we meet you?  Uh, hangar two. Right off the main runway.  [soldiers shouting.]  But you better hurry your ass up.  Hangar two?  We could be there in 20 minutes.  We can be there in 20 minutes.  I don't know if we have that long.  Wait for us. We'll be there.  We got to move.  [gunshots.]  [Sid grunting.]  [groaning.]  Sid  Sid!  CYCLOPS: I heard your call, infidel.  Wings will not carry you to safety.  One call, and my brothers  will find your friends at the airport.  [panting.]  [phone beeps.]  [Cyclops speaking Arabic.]   [Sid and Cyclops struggling.]  - [stabs.] - [screams.]  - LINCOLN: Sid! - MICHAEL: Sid!  LINCOLN: Son of a bitch.  No, no, no, no, no.  [grunts.]  MICHAEL: Talk to me, Sid. Stay with us.  Stay with us.  Sid  MICHAEL: Sid.  He's gone.  [sniffling.]  [laughs.]  [Michael grunting.]  Don't waste yourself on him.  [moans.]  You'll beat him by surviving.  CYCLOPS: You will die, you hear me?  You will all die!  Oh, my  PILOT: They're moving more trucks into position.  - Yeah. - We can't wait.  There won't be enough runway to take off. We must go now.  SHEBA: I owe Lincoln my life. He deserves better.  But with so many souls in our hands,  do we really have a choice?  [exhales.]  Listen, we wait five more minutes.  Okay?  And then we take care of the souls that we can.  Understand?  What the hell are you doing?  The hell are you doing?  Listen, we are not leaving my friends!  Shut it down. Shut it down!  You would condemn us all to death.  If you stop me, no one gets out.  Your friends can still make it to safety. We will not.  [gunshots.]  [phone ringing.]  Yeah?  C-Note? You got to get out of here, man.  Hey, no, no, no, no. W-We can do this thing, man. We can do it.  No! Go now! Otherwise, you and the kids are dead!  We'll work something out.  We've been through worse.  C-NOTE: Linc, I'm so sorry.  I'm so sorry, brother.  Lincoln? Find Omar. He  - [static crackles.] - What?  I can't hear you. What?  [gunshots.]
