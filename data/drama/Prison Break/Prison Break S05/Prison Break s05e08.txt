                    			1 - Previously on Prison Break - We're gonna get you out of here.  - MICHAEL: The escape is on. - Go, go, go!  Who the hell is the guy?  He's my brother.  Can't die on me now, Michael, you know, you're gonna tell me  - why I'm your whip hand. - LINCOLN: We found Michael.  - He's been busted up real bad. - I got to go.  JACOB: You don't know what you'd be walking into.  It's not safe.  SARA: I can't look my son in the eye  and tell him that I let his father die,  a father he's never met.  Never thought I'd see this face again.  MICHAEL: You weren't supposed to.  LUCA: Lincoln Burrows.  How about you step out  and pay us the 100 grand you owe us.  There is nobility in you, Lincoln. You should rest up.  - We're gonna need you. - Didn't know you worried.  About the right things.  SARA: What's wrong?  It's him. Your husband.  Jacob  is Poseidon.  He's a CIA operative,  deep cover. He runs a splinter cell  called 21-Void.  He targeted me for my skills.  Michael, he's with our son right now.  I'll get to the States as soon as I can.  Did my husband, Jacob Ness,  ask you to work on my cell phone?  He said he was looking to find  the people who were stalking  his wife, so I did a data dive.  Where's my son?  I have him.  And whether or not I have to threaten him  is entirely contingent upon you putting the gun down.  VAN GOGH: Kaniel Outis  has been located on a cargo ship  in the Mediterranean.  They made you.  Run!  [whooshing.]  [explosion.]    - WHIP: Hey! - [whistle blowing.]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey, yo,  where we headed?  Marseille.  - WHIP: Marseilles. - Marseilles.  JACOB: I own you, Scofield.  I know everything about you.  Even your most mundane actions, like the zoo.  What's with you and the zoo?  MICHAEL: I go there to think.  JACOB: 18 times in the past month?  A lot of thinking. I was figuring out how to get  - your guy out of Barranquilla. - Hmm.  Turns out he's not just a rebel leader  He's a murderous sociopath.  That's the only way to make omelets.  I need to know more about our targets.  If I'm facilitating escapes, we can't have surprises.  Be proud. You and me,  - we're changing the world. - Doesn't make it right.  Don't act like you're suddenly a fan of the status quo, okay?  The system, it's slow, stupid, and doomed to fail.  That's why you had to bust your brother out in the first place.  New ink since the last time I saw you.  - Working on a new plan? - No. No new plan.  Just get tired of looking at empty skin.  Uh-huh.  You know, it was those tats at Fox River  that caught my eye in the first place.  I had to know everything about the man  who wore his plans on his skin.  In plain sight yet so mysterious.  The key to real power is to disappear.  - Hi, Professor Ness. - Hello, Claudia.  Yeah, the secret to real power  is to never betray your intentions,  to wear nothing on your sleeve.  And to never let anyone  see your face.  [trilling.]  [click.]  Come on in.  Next time I'm sitting in solitary,  I'll think of you in here, running the world  in air-conditioned comfort.  JACOB: I've spent my time in the field.  You all set for Myanmar?  It's only a few weeks off.  That's why I'm here.  I want to bring someone on board.  - Oh, really? - The prison camp  at Sittwe is a two-man job.  I've been watching this guy. He'll be useful.  Watching him? You in charge  - of recruiting now? - Trust me.  The last thing I was to do is suck someone else into this.  He'll have my back and he'll speed things up,  increase our odds.  [sighs.]  Not exactly a distinguished career.  He's held up well in prison. He's got a mean streak.  And he grew up without a family.  It means he can be manipulated.  If you're planning something,  I'll always be a step ahead of you.  You know that.  I can see everything in your eyes.  It's what's behind the eyes that counts,  Professor.  Hmm.  So you're gonna wait a year  for me to find my way out of Sittwe?  Or are you gonna get me a partner,  so we get on with the business of changing the world?  Done.  [gulls calling.]    I need some food.  - [phone chimes.] - I'm with you.  Linc, it's Sara.  She's back in New York.  LINCOLN: Are she and Mike okay?  That's what I'm trying to find out.      What is it, Michael?  Something's wrong.  Yes, you will.  [muffled shouting.]     - I got to get back to the States. - Slow down.  You're Kaniel Outis, remember?  You're on every no-fly list in the world.  Jacob's done something to Sara. Maybe Mike, too.  - How do you know? - That text.  She referred to our son as Junior.  We agreed we'd never call him that.  He's baiting you, Michael.  It worked.  [birds chirping.]    Hey, buddy.  Where's Mom?  Oh. I, uh, dropped her off at work  while you were at school.  That is quite a pirate ship.  Although it would be a little hard  to sail with the mast that far forward.  - Your ship might tip over. - The mast has  to be there. It's not just a ship  It's a treasure map.  [chuckles.] What do you mean?  It's for Jimmy. We hide Legos for each other.  I always find his.  He doesn't always find mine.  Wait a second,  how is this drawing a map?  This is the park.  That's the playground.  And this is the sidewalk.  Impressive.  You put a code in the drawing.  So, okay, where did you hide the Legos?  These cannons are pools at the park.  But there's an extra one, in the sand.  That's where I buried the Legos.  Well done, Mike.  Well done.  I've tried everyone. I'm out of resources in the States.  All my contacts. People who can go and check on them,  make sure they're okay.  Linc, I got to get home.  I can't spend another two weeks on a cargo ship.  He's got my wife and kid.  There may be another way.  You told me about the last seven years of your life.  Haven't told you about mine.  After Sara got exonerated, she left Panama.  Me and Sofia stayed behind and opened a dive shop.  We broke up, and everything went to hell.  You weren't there to stop me, so before I knew it,  I was in the old hood, doing odd jobs.  Odd jobs meaning what?  Moving things from point A to point B.  For Luca Abruzzi.  John Abruzzi's son.  Yeah.  I just wanted some quick cash to kick-start my life.  They told me not to look in the boxes.  But I looked in the boxes.  The amount of fentanyl they're smuggling out of Europe  Tens of thousands of pills in every box  It's just killing people.  So I dumped a box in a Dumpster,  100 grand's worth.  Now you're in hock to Abruzzi's son.  Yeah. He wants to kill me.  But maybe it's a way to get back to the States real fast.    LUCA: You got balls, Burrows.  You actually think I want to help you?  What if I can get you the $100K?  [scoffs.] $100K?  How are you gonna come up with that  crawling around the back alleys of Chicago?  I'm not in Chicago. I'm in Marseilles.  - [chuckles.] Marseilles? - Yeah.  I've been working on a couple deals. I got $100K  in my hand. But I want off the hook.  Sure you do. How about you get over here and hand it to me?  That's why I'm calling.  I need to sneak into the States invisible, like your pills.  Those flights you got coming out of Europe  The fentanyl flights I need a few seats.  [sighs.]  I'll tell you what.  I'll make a few calls.  'Cause either I'm gonna see you  and get that money, or I'm gonna see you,  and you're gonna get something a whole lot worse.  [beep, sighs.]  I can't believe I'm doing this to myself again.  Difference is this time, you're not alone.  [birds screeching.]  God, these things are disgusting.  What they call 'em again?  Boudin noir.  Not sure what's in them.  I don't think your French is as good as you think it is.  Yo, be happy you're not eating snails.  [indistinct chatter.]  Hey.  Do you think they noticed?  Let's not take any chances.  Guys.  Your faces were on the news.  WHIP: Somebody sees you, this thing is over.  - We got to move, papi. - We got to go.  [phone dinging.]  Hold. Luca.  If you can get to Lyon by midnight,  I can get you on a flight.  I got a warehouse in New York. You're coming to me?  We'll be there.  Can't decide whether I want you  to have that money or not, Burrows.  Killing you might be a lot more satisfying.  JACOB: Now we know they survived the strike in the Mediterranean.  We can be pretty sure he's coming back to Ithaca.  I need some clarification.  Why would he come back here  to the States  when he's more wanted here  than anywhere else in the world?  Of course.  [clears his throat.]  Because of them.  He had a life before he worked for me,  a name Michael Scofield.  A family.  And when he went away, I ended up looking after them.  Ended up falling for them.  Well  He wants to kill me.  He thinks I stole his life, ruined him, which speaks  to his dissociative mind.  I mean, he's a murderer, a turncoat, a terrorist.  But we'll use it.  I'll be the bait if I have to.  So we can go about taking him down once and for all.  He's not just gonna stroll in here.  He's too clever for that.  That's why we got someone even more clever.  Thoreau?  Guy's a pencil neck.  A pencil neck with insight into Scofield's plan.  So you, in turn, can be the hammer.  [door opens.]  NELSON: Screen-grab of the Skype transmission  he sent from the desert.  He routed the image through a server  to this BlueHawaii guy, but it could have been  secretly subrouted to another, yet  unknown, recipient to use the information encoded in it.  Information?  It's actually incredible.  Encrypted in the Arabic, the images are all sorts of stuff.  Apparently, mundane as hell.  Visiting hours for zoos, links to defunct message boards  on the Internet.  What message boards?  Truesnuff.com, Hunterspycamporn.com,  both of which carry this.  Images of the Harlan Gaines murder.  What's the bastard doing rubbing that in our faces?  Of all the things to encrypt, why that?  What's that get you?  Stegaonographically, a lot.  Steganography is the practice of concealing information  in the code that makes up digital files.  Russians do it, Chinese, everybody.  He's probably thinking if anyone sees this,  this'll be as far as they'll look.  But I'm already going inside the image, breaking down the data  - that comprises it. - This is making my head spin.  Point is we put big data, AI on this,  we can crunch any codes hidden in there pretty quickly.  And that's what I'm doing.  Nice work, but the truth is if I've done my job,  he may reveal his intentions to us first.  [sighs.]  Because I've got him so far off his game now,  he'll start to play his cards too early  Teddy.  "But in return, you must take a life."  JACOB: show us what the tattoos mean  even before the computers will, and all the people  he'll be enlisting for the fight.  You have to call this pay phone  in France.  [woman speaking French over P.A. system.]  Wait. Chicago? I thought I was going with you.  Not until you find out why you're my whip-hand.  I have to go to Chicago to find that out?  Safe travels.  In the grandiosity of his plan,  he'll lose sight of the simplest details.  The phone he texted me with  was located in Lyon, France last night.  It was turned off in an airport terminal at 11:51 p.m  20 minutes before a direct flight to New York where  you'll be waiting for him  to put this game to bed for good.    WOMAN [over P.A..]: Flight 290 to Miami, Florida  will now depart from gate B24.  He just powered back up.  [chiming.]  We got him.  Look out!  Back of the plane.  Uh, excuse me! Excuse me.  You're not allowed  [phone chirping.]  Looks like the game's still going.    [plane's tires squeal.]  It's impressive how you get these drugs  in the country just by bribing small-time  airport officials.  I'm guessing you got about  five million bucks worth of fentanyl in here.  So what?  You and your brother here are gonna lecture me?  We were actually debating on whether  I should give you the 100K or not.  He says it's blood money.  I agree. Ã¢ÂÂ­How about you just shut up and pay me, Burrows?  I don't have it.  Grab his guys, bring 'em to the back and shoot 'em.  I don't think you want to add murder to your arrest warrant.  Wait.  Arrest warrant?  That guy out there  is a DEA informant.  We have him in our pocket.  He owes us. He's got three vans  full of agents that are waiting for his call.  They're gonna rain down on you and your pills.  Unless you forgive my brother's debt.  Then our informant won't make the call.  Have your brother fighting your battles, do you?  No.  Why don't you tell your guys to drop the guns,  and you and I can have it out?  What do you say, Luca?  Scare that guy off.  Bring these guys to the back.  They make a move, he makes a call.  Yeah? I think you're bluffing.  I warned you.  We got company.  [engines revving.]  [tires squealing.]  MICHAEL: You shoot us, there's dozens of witnesses now.  Let's go.  [engines revving, tires squealing.]  [tires squealing.]  All they had to see were DEA hats and SUVs,  and they were gone.  Famous Michael Scofield.  Sheba. Thank you for everything.  You have no idea how happy I am to see you back home.  We're not home yet.  All right, so what's next?  How do we get this son of a bitch?  We don't do anything.  Your part is over.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Tricking Abruzzi's kid is one thing.  Poseidon he knows your face.  Been tracking you since you went to Yemen.  You've been a warrior,  and I owe you.  But your face is a liability now to you and your family.  I don't want you to risk that.  They may know his face, but they don't know mine.  It's the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out.  That's my Sheba.  You take care of her, all right?  I take care of him, you mean.  [laughs.]  - I love you, brother. - Love you, too.  Be safe,  - okay? - You, too.  Bye. All right.  Well  when you need me again,  you know where to find me.  [birds singing.]  We'll transport her at 1600 hours.  Lay low until then. Thank you.  Hey?  That doesn't bother you What you just saw in there?  Down in the basement  with his wife, the woman he says he fell for?  Stop.  I'm done with 21-Void after this.  After we get Scofield Outis  Whatever his name is  I'm done.  That's all I ever wanted, to get Gaines' killer, but  what he's got going in there  That's not normal.  It's personal.  Something sicker.  There's no leaving 21-Void, Van. You know that.  He hired us because we are the best.  We can do whatever we want.  And if we want to disappear after this  we can disappear.  There's no getting out.  If you think that way  then you're a prisoner, too.  MAN: The guy at the gate said the vehicles split  five minutes after they got here.  Five minutes?  Something ain't right.  The product is still here.  Come on.  It was all staged.  Clever.  But Burrows is gonna die for it.  I don't know how we're gonna find him.  He's in the wind.  Maybe not.  EZ Pass transponders.  Santora's got a guy at transit authority.  I bet you he can us what roads they've been taking and when.  Then it's up to us to comb the neighborhoods,  find the vehicles,  and put a bullet in that son of a bitch once and for all.    MAN [over PA.]: Please keep your baggage with you at all times.  Unattended baggage is a security risk and may result  I got a weird request.  If I give you some coordinates, can you take me to 'em?  See what I can do.  No.  Unless this cab's got pontoons,  ain't gonna happen.  These coordinates are in the middle of Lake Michigan.  This is it.  LINCOLN: No lights.  I don't think they're here, Michael.  Unless that's what he wants us to think.  Come on.  Get ready to get us out of here as fast as you can.  SHEBA: Linc.  Be careful.  Thanks.  What's wrong?  That's why Sara never responded.  I wasn't allowed to contact anyone,  but she was my wife.  I reached out to her in a way  I thought only she would know.  But he knew my ways, too.        [lock clicks.]  Nothing.    What are you doing?  That's not Sara, Michael.  He doesn't know I know that.        -  - That's the right answer.  She's alive.  He must be right there with her.  I'm gonna set a meeting.  And what, you're just gonna show up and show your face?  Yes.  That means Poseidon has to show his face, too.  And the endgame begins.  It's high noon, boss.  I'm not seeing him.  And you shouldn't. He's waiting for us  to push the first piece out onto the board.  Which would be me?  Maybe not.  Black SUV.  Something I can help you with?  Car service. I'm here to pick up a lady and child.  They got another ride. Hit the road.  Are you sure?  Hit the road.  Mark the black SUV.  No need. They were just here to make you show your face.  Walk away, please. Now.  Okay, act the tiniest bit flustered.  Now repeat these words back to me loud enough to be heard:  "They didn't show.  I'm coming back to you now."  They didn't show.  I'm coming back to you now.  Now we have a game.  He's already revealed  his brother, his biggest piece.  Soon he'll have to show his face. Trailer,  please take him down.  What the?  I lost him.  Hey.  Can you hear me?  Damn it.  No signal.  What are you doing here?  I lost reception in the garage.  Damn it, you fell right into it.  Now they've got a mark on us.  Black sedan.  He's heading west.  Please!  Please, don't shoot.  You okay?  So that's what the dog who's destroying my country  looks like.  [phone rings.]  Talk to me.  LINCOLN: Michael, we found the car.  We're on the corner of Third and Washington by an alley.  Get here now.  He had Sara with him  - but we couldn't see her. - What do you mean you couldn't see her?  SHEBA: There's no way we could have.  Oh, my God. Sara.  There was no one  - in the backseat? - No, the windows  were blacked out We couldn't see.  What's that?  My son did this.  He's good.  There might be something here.  It's a ship.  A pirate ship with three pirates  Man, woman and a boy.  That's me, Sara and Mike.  What do you think that is?  It's a it's a many-headed hydra  reaching up to attack.  Think it's Jacob?  Must be.  - This is a message. - You're telling me  Mikey's left something encoded in that?  Yeah. Yeah, it's encoded in him.  He's got my DNA.  He didn't even know you were coming.  Sara must have told him. I don't know.  She must have told him I was coming.  There's definitely something here. Definitely.  What is it?  It's one of Luca's guys.  SHEBA: What?  How the hell did he track us here?  I don't know. All I know is all the chickens  are coming home to roost at the worst possible time.  We got to go.  Linc?  I got it.  This ship, this galleon.  The body of water it's on. I looked at the map.  There's a lake, a lake shaped exactly like it,  up in the Finger Lakes district.  "Long lake."  This X  would be on the east shore of that lake.  He's telling us where he is.  I'm trying to figure out if you lost your mind or not.  There's only one way to find out.  - Uh-uh. - What?  - You're going back to Buffalo. - What?!  I want you to be with your family, look after the refugees.  Linc, I'm a part of this fight, too  What was that?  It's good-bye.  I could never forgive myself  if something happened to you.    Can I help you?  Yeah.  Can I rent a boat?  I want to take one out on the lake.  [sighs.]  [sighs.]  Been thinkin'.  God  I been thinking.  'Cause a hard bargain's been presented to me,  and I'm considering something  that's-that's gonna seem like  the old Theodore Bagwell.  T-Bag. [chuckles.]  And if that's indeed what's coming  it won't be the work  of a cold-blooded man.  And it won't be for sin  or for hate.  If there's blood on my hands,  know this, world  it'll be for love.  [takes deep breath.]    How you doing, buddy?  I'm sick of the lake house.  I want to go home.  I know. I know.  [sighs.] We'll go home soon.  Don't worry.  Is Mom okay?  She's, uh  she's a little under the weather.  She's just resting.  Everything will be fine, kiddo.  Everything will be back to normal soon enough, okay?    Michael, go get him. And I'll be ready.  - Thanks, man, that was fun. - Yeah, anytime.  Yeah, great. Thank you.  What kind of honorific is Whip?  Who's asking?  A man drawn into this by destiny.  Okay. How about you take off?  I don't exactly cotton to strange men coming up to me  in the middle of the night, you know?  Only one person calls me Whip you ain't him.  Nobody calls you that.  Man who gave me this hand. Nobody.  Kaniel Outis.  Or for those of us who know him,  Michael Scofield.  Who are you?  We all got handles, don't we?  Outis. T-Bag. Whip.  But you're Dave Martin, aren't you?  How'd you know that?  Huh?  You better start talking, old man.  You don't want to tangle with this.  Neither do you.  [grunts.]  All your answers are right in here, all right?  West Virginia honky-tonk,  1991, pretty waitress,  bunch of personal business between us after closing,  and then I git, 'cause Johnny Law's breathing down my neck.  Lacking a forwarding address,  I never heard from her again.  What are you trying to tell me?  Scofield was looking for a partner, combing prisons,  looking for someone who could handle himself.  And with your innate ability to thrive,  rising to the top in even the worst of cages,  you reminded him of a certain someone.  And so he did a little research.  Wanted to know what we all want to know.  Did you learn it  or was it ingrained in you?  [shuddering breath.]  It was ingrained in you, son.  You got it from me.  [panting.]    [phone rings.]  Linc, he's here.  - My son. - Thank God.  Hold on.  Hold up.  I think Jacob's coming back.  I can't believe I'm seeing my son.  Something's wrong.  Sara's here, but  - something's wrong. - Don't do anything. He's coming back.  I'm going in.  LINCOLN: It's not Jacob.  You're clear.  Get your family. Get your son.  Burrows!  [grunts.]  [whispering.]: Hi, Mike.  You know who I am?  I got your map.  I'm gonna get you and your mother out of here.  I I didn't draw a map.  - Is someone in there with your mom? - It's not  We need to run.  [gunshot.]
