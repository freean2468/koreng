Scylla



                    			My name is Michael Scofield, and I am a fugitive. Three weeks ago, I was in a Panamanian prison. While I was there, I was approached by the Company. The company is a corrupt organization involved in all levels of industry and government. They gave me two options: Break one of their men James Whistler out of that prison or else they would kill the only woman I ever loved Dr. Sara Tancredi. I held up my end of the deal and I broke Whistler out. But The Company they killed Sara anyway. I don't know why the Company wanted James Whistler out of prison but I've tracked him here to Los Angeles. He's with another Company agent I know only as Gretchen the same agent who murdered Sara. This ends today. I came here seeking justice. The justice I know the system cannot provide. So if you're reading this letter, you'll know I died avenging Sara's death. You get the data card. We drop it off in the racing form, and we get the hell out of there. Who's the contact we're leaving it for? The Company wants the card back, period. All you need to worry about is getting this rig the hell out of there in a hurry. Oh, I' be getting it out of there. Don't you worry about that. You worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time. If you pull this off, you can come up to my room later and the word "no" won't be in my vocabulary. Just make sure we get paid. In and out. Good to see you again. You, too. Didn't hear from you for a while. Started to wonder if you were still interested. I am, very much so. Well, I needed to approach this carefully. I'm sure you understand. Who you buying it for? A competitor? A foreign country? Jason, you know I can't get into that. Now, we've been negotiating this for months. I've jumped through all your hoops. I've agreed to meet you here. Do you want to sell the card to me or not? Be right back. That's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic. Let me give you a little bit of advice and this is on the house watch your step with that thing. The Company will do anything to get it back. Don't I know it. - Yeah? - What the hell are you doing? We got to get out of here. I need to hide the gun. Take the gun with you! Where is she? Michael, you don't understand. Call Gretchen, get her in here now. You have to trust me. I'm not your enemy, Michael. James. We need to leave. You know, despite everything if Sara could weigh in right now, she'd tell me not to kill you. That's the kind of person she was. That's the kind of person you took from me. James, didn't you tell him? - He walked in five - Shut up! Gretchen, look at me. This is for Sara. I never killed Sara. I wouldn't expect someone like you to take this with dignity. I swear to God she's alive. Don't insult me and don't insult her. She escaped. We knew if you found out we wouldn't have any leverage. I fabricated the whole thing. - My brother saw - A head in a box! From a cadaver. You ask Lincoln what he really saw. - Listen to her, Michael. - Don't lie to me. I'm not lying to you. Lincoln bought it, you bought it, it worked. Michael. Then where is she? I'll tell you when we get outside. Right now, we need to get out of here. They found the bodies. - Give me the gun. - She's lying. Is she? If you pull that trigger, you'll never know. Kill him, James. Shut up. Where is she? Where is Sara?! Michael, if you don't give me that gun, I'm going to shoot you in the head. Let's go. We got a double homicide at the Roosevelt Hotel. Sara. Do you know the difference between a perfectly executed operation and a failed mission? - Sir? - It's small unit leadership. The Allies spent two and a half years planning the invasion of Normandy, but on D-Day it came down to a handful of men on a strip of beach to decide the fate of the world. What I'm getting at, Gretchen, is even the best plan is only as good as the moving parts on the ground executing it. General, we got your card. What's the problem? We have nothing. It's a duplicate. Almost flawless, but a duplicate. That's impossible. - I saw - You know how important the retrieval of this card is to me, Gretchen. You know that this is a security breach that could have catastrophic ramifications for the Company. The only thing I can think of there was a blind spot when Whistler was hitting the target. Maybe he made a duplicate and he still has the original. You hired him. You kept him at the tip of the spear. You insisted that we get him out of Sona. We had to. He had already made contact with the target. At that point, it was him or no one, sir. What's your stake in all of this? I had nothing to do with it. Whistler acted on his own. I swear to you. General, I can fix this. You trained me. Not well enough, apparently. You know what to do. Please. I have a bank account in Dubai left over from a slush fund from COBRA II. It's yours. No, please, please Hello. Hey, it's me. Where are you, man? Los Angeles. You okay, Michael? No, I'm, I'm safe. Thank God, thank God. How's LJ and Sofia? Yeah, they're, um I'm staring at them right now in fact. They're fine. You hear about Sona? What about it? Burned down three days back. The inmates they rioted. No sign of Bellick T-Bag, or Sucre. Sucre? He got popped I don't know how. I mean, the papers listed the names of the inmates, and he was in there when it went down. I found Whistler and Gretchen and, uh Gretchen said she said Sara is still alive. What did you see, Linc? What do you mean what did I see, Michael? I need you to tell me exactly what you saw. Michael, Sara's gone. Well, you said it was in a garage, right? So it was dark. Yeah, it was dark. But if you're asking me if I picked up the head to check to see if it was Sara, no, Michael, I-I LJ said he he only heard them kill Sara, right? You just got to come back, please. Come back. Let's just let's just start a new life. Tell Sofia I said hi. And tell LJ tell him his uncle loves him. Michael, don't do this, please. Out, out! You need some better ventilation back there, amigo. ue? Want to translate that? Don't worry about it. Gracias. Where's your mom? She'll be here. What do you mean she'll be here? We're-we're running out of time. -I got to be up there. - Don't worry. My mom wouldn't let me down. At least, she hasn't yet. Bradley Over here! Mom! Mom! I told you! Don't worry, you'll make it there! Ah! Oh! Oh! What is it called? EuropeanGoldfinch.net So we can all use to communicate. Michael. Don't worry, I'm alone. It's good to see you. So where's your new best friend? Well I don't know about that, but Whistler's not who you think he is. We're working together against the Company. - Yeah? - Yeah. And what about Gretchen? She working with you? He needed her to further his plan. Look, if the guy was Company, he'd have shot you dead back at that conference like she wanted him to. Do you have any information about Sara or not? Let's go somewhere a little more private. I want you to tell me right now. I want you to tell me right now, right here! Or we can get Gretchen on the phone. Gretchen's dead. She never showed up. Come and talk to me, please. Whistler and I were at that conference to get a data card. It's like the Company's black book. And it lists all their agents, all their operations. They refer to it as "Scylla. " Whistler's got it. Alex, talk to me about Sara. That's all I care about. I understand that. I want nothing more than to get home to my wife and my son. But that's not gonna happen for either of us with the Company out there trying to kill us. You don't know anything about Sara, do you? Whistler does. He tells me he does. And he wants to tell you. But he wants something in return. What? What does he want from me? To talk to you. I'm sorry about all that the other night. If I had more time, I would've explained myself better. Sure. What are we doing here? - Alex told you about Scylla? - Yes. I have it. There's one last step involved in order to read the data. And that step involves breaking into a secured structure. So now you need my help. Yeah. My book, the bird book, the one I lost in Sona contained information that would've helped facilitate the break-in, but it can still be accomplished, with your help. Where's Sara? The only thing I know for sure, a week ago, some information came through the wire. Sara may have bought a bus ticket in Santa Fe. Headed where? Chicago. Michael, if Sara's out there, she's not safe none of us are. The Company knows we still have the original card, and that's why Gretchen was the first to go. I think we're done here. Michael,We have a chance for once to get Scylla to people that want to take the Company down. I don't want to run anymore. We won't have to run anymore. I spent the last month thinking Sara was dead and that it was my fault. If she's out there, I'm gonna find her. That's all I care about. This can be done within a week. Less. At least let me show you Oh, I'm gonna miss these gams, girl. Don't go. This ain't no home for a white boy from Alabama. They're here, senior. The bags are packed. You kept your word to me. You're the first that's ever done that. Gracias. Why must you go after this man? You could choose not to. Where I come from, there's something called a blood feud. Comprende? Yes. Michael Scofield left me for dead one too many times, as it turns out. What is Spanish for "little angel"? Angelita. Adios, angelita. Is this legit? Oh, si senior. For the money you're paying, first class, all the way. So these are coyotes one can trust. Oh, si senior. Vamanos. As you've seen, what you're entering into is quite serious. I realize that. You're responsible for this now. You have nothing to worry about. We'll talk soon. It's time to clean up now. Thoroughly. Everyone who was close to Whistler: Scofield, Mahone, Burrows. Burrows is still in Panama. Clean up. Hello. Hi, Pam. Where Where are you? Uh, you know. In the middle of it, as usual. Panama still? No. No. Are you okay? Definitely. Are you? Yes. And Cameron? He's fine. I have to tell you, Pam, you know, I had a plan for all of us to be together. And I'm not gonna stop working on it. Why do you need a plan if you want to be with someone? You just be with them. Don't say that unless you mean it. 'Cause I'll turn this world upside down to get back to you. So don't say it unless you mean it. I mean it. Okay. Come on, babe. I I hate plantains, you know that. I try your chili burger. Chili chili burger? You loved the chili burger. Okay, I'm gonna make them with my mom's special recipe. Your mom's special recipe? You'll love it. Really? Yeah! You'll love 'em. Trust me. It's delicious. Let's get out of here. Drop 'em. Let's go. Give me your hand. LJ. Yeah, come with me. Lincoln, what's going on? Dad. We're safe now. Relax. No. I saw someone. Looks like Company, I'm sure of it. Let's just go, okay? Let's go. We'll-we'll be fine. - All right, all right. - Yeah. Okay. Let's go. Get back. Dad! Dad, we have to run. Go. Get out of here. Run! Get going! Lincoln! Lincoln! I'm looking for Alex. I don't know where he is. No? No. Uh, we've been divorced for almost two years now. We haven't had contact in months. I would think that might change now that he's back in the U.S. I am so sick of you people What are you, a fed? thinking that you can keep on harassing I'm not with the government, Pam. Mom, could you come here? We're done talking Bruce Bennett. Do you know who this is? I do. I'm looking for Sara, and right now, you're the only person I can think of who can help me. Hold on. Where are you? Back in Chicago. Have you heard from her? Meet me in front of the Drake Hotel in a half hour. Please just tell me is she alive? Are you Michael Scofield? Are you Michael Scofield? Yes, I am. Michael Scofield. Special Agent Don Self, Homeland Security. Were you there when James Whistler was killed? I didn't kill him. I know you didn't. He was an independent contractor who worked for the Company for about ten years. He was assigned to retrieve Scylla once it went missing. Do you know what Scylla is? It's the Company's little black book. So he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me. What do you want from me? You're looking at major time. You know that, right? So how would you like to walk away from it all not do a day? - In exchange for? - Scylla. All right. Sara Tancredi, last seen in Panama, if you help me find her, maybe we've got a deal. I'm sorry, she's not my department, Scylla is. Then go find it yourself. It seems to me, the U.S. government should have a little more reach than someone who's looking at major time. To perform the operation, Michael, that would require signatures from about 20 different department heads. Do you want to bet at least one of them is Company? The only way this is going to work is via freelancer, off the books. It sounds complicated. I'll take a pass. I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail, not to mention the time that your brother's facing. What are you talking about? The Company tried to take him out in Panama. He, um reacted, apparently. But I just made a deal with the Panamanian authorities for him to serve out his time in the U.S. He should be touching ground any time now. You recognize this handwriting? This is your father's. He spent the last two years of his life going after this very thing. Do you believe in fate, Michael? I think I'd like to talk to my brother. Oh, no. Oh, no. What's going? Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop! Hey! You don't want to go in there. You don't want to go in there. God, she's Lilah Maria Sucre. She gave her my name? Soy tu papa. You're setting me up? Sucre, you can't keep bringing Maricruz down. You can't do this to her anymore. Wait. Don't Sucre, don't Go! Go! Oh, boy. We're screwed. You know why Scofield gets all twisted up when he's around me? We're the same, and he just can't stand it. Drives his ass crazy. We got the same brilliant mind, the same natural-born leader tendency, the same one-in-a-million-type charisma, yes? He just gonna look down his nose at me? How you gonna find him? This. You're both into birds? No, no. It's either gonna take me to him, or he to me. I just know it. If I was you, I'd forget about this Scofield. You have plenty of money. See? I mean how much money you have in that bag? Why don't you just mind your own beeswax, huh? You just keep pointing this jalopy northbound, all right? Get me back to the land o' cotton. Of course. Ready. Only a few people in government will know of the operation. It has to stay that way, or people's lives will be in danger, mine included. Taking down the Company sounds a little bigger than a two-man job, no? I'm going to get you help. I thought you said, you couldn't trust anybody. Yeah, but maybe you can. All right, two of your cohorts Fernando Sucre, and Brad Bellick were arrested, they're both facing time, and Alexander Mahone is in a Colorado jail cell. Good, let him sit there. You're going to need Mahone if you want to make this happen. He was working with Whistler. And you'll have me. Okay? Whatever you need, I'll provide. Whistler also said something about a second step, something about a break-in. Yeah, the card has all the data on it, but it's encrypted. Once you get your hands on it, you're going to need to find a way to break into the Company's headquarters. It's the only way to unlock what's on the card. Where's the building? - L.A. - Where in L.A.? I don't know. So, we've got a data card, which could be anywhere, and we've got to break into a building, the location of which has yet to be determined. Simple enough. You've broken out of two penitentiaries. I'm thinking, uh, breaking into a building isn't too far outside your wheelhouse. How do you know our dad? He heard from contacts that I could be trusted. Your father was a good man. Why now? Look, I've been going after the Company for five years. Okay? When Whistler was killed yesterday, the plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation. But, uh I convinced my superiors to give it one more chance. So this is like job security for you? What's that? Well, when we go out there and risk our necks, you can collect your pension. No, no, no, Lincoln. Okay, some people still care about their job. Some people still fight for this country. Maybe you've been a little too distracted boosting car stereos and breaking heads to remember that. If we do this deal, after it's done, you can look for Sara if she's alive. If we take this deal, we'll both be dead long before I get the chance, Linc. You guys must have some big-time friends. What are you talking about? Somebody just posted a significant amount of bail for both of you. Who? I don't know, but they're outside. You're free to go. Here, take your dad's file. My number's inside. - We ain't doing this. - Just take it anyway. This file, it means nothing to me anymore. Bruce Bennett. Let's go for a drive. I thought I'd never see you again. I have something for you. Okay. You left this behind. Is that what this is about? You just getting me my rose back? Yeah. I guess I'm done now. I can retire. How much time are you looking at? They're saying 15 years. I have to find out for sure. I heard Lincoln say something about a deal. No jail time. In exchange for taking down the Company. How? Exactly. I love you. That's all I know right now. "Will you not yield to the immortal gods?" "That nightmare cannot die. " "Eternal evil itself. " "There is no fighting her, no. " "No power that can fight her. " Now, listen to me it's up to you now. "All that avails is flight. " I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry. Do you want to talk about it? It's not your fault. It's not. Tell me what happened. It's just the Company. It's just what they do. It wasn't just me. God, it was you and LJ and-and Lincoln. And they won't stop, and I don't know how to deal with that. Hey, come here. Come here. Come here. Let's go! Are you okay? I can't believe they found us so fast. Should I call should I call Bruce and-and get some place safe? No place is safe. They're not gonna stop unless we stop them. Linc? - You are thinking what I'm thinking? - Let's end this. But I'm not gonna leave you behind again. Yeah? We're in. Hey, papi. Linc. I can't tell you how grateful I am for you including me. Well, Sucre vouched for you, Bellick. He said you came through for him down in Panama. Alex? Michael. You ready for this? Yeah. I am. So I hear Whistler's bird book has details about what we need to steal. Yeah. You know who's got it, right? Please. We'll die out here. Thank you for the cash, gringo. First class all the way. Do we have any idea where T-Bag is? That snake could be anywhere. When we're in LA, we can think like convicts, we just can't act like them. If we do, we're done. It goes without saying this is your last chance to back out, 'cause first on the list of things I cannot guarantee you is your safety. We're all a long way from where this started. But what I can guarantee you is that if we do this thing right, we'll be close to where it ends. Freedom. Finally. You two, let's go. Hey, Mike? What about Sara? Sara's in. All right, we're heading out tomorrow. I have to finalize a few things before we go. No games and no stunts. Otherwise, I promise, you're gonna see a whole different side of me. Likewise. Fake IDs. It's a good start, but there are some things you can't fake, and there are some things you can't hide. Know what I mean? How high is your threshold for pain? You sure you don't want a sedative? We're gonna go into the night. How do you feel? Lighter somehow. Look, I don't know how we're gonna take them down. I don't even know who they are, but I do know one thing the Company's gonna pay for what they did to you. Let's go. You sure you're up for this? If we can do it together, um yeah. Absolutely. A C-130? What do they want want us to parachute out of this thing? This guy called in a favor to the Air Force. It's not like we can be flying commercial, you know? If you're successful with obtaining Scylla, you'll not only avoid jail time, but you can take great pride in knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat to its own democracy. If you're killed while doing so, a proper funeral will be provided. But if you try to escape, you will have no funeral. You will have nothing, and you will be apprehended and buried where we find you. I sincerely hope we understand each other. You better hold up your end of the deal. Let's go!
