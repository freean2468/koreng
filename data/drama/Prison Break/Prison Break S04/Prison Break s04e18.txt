                    			Previously on Prison Break: I had a deal with the General. You couldn't just let me handle this? If by handle, you mean give Scylla back to the General, then no. I should warn you I'm going to do everything in my power to stop you. I want my life back. Linc, Mom is alive. What? I guess I'll see you in Miami. If I give Scylla back to the General, he leaves me and Michael alone, and I get to spend time with my son in peace. What if General Krantz were no longer in the picture? What's going on? - Good-bye, Jonathan. Where are you, Christina? I don't like your tone, Jonathan. Excuse me, but it's been a while since anyone's tried to kill me. The General should know by now not to mess with us. The General didn't send me. Christina is going to change the Company. She said after two days she would make the change? - Yeah. Look at the date on that laminate-- two days away. I need to talk to her. Lincoln's back at the plaza. I told him to stay away. We have a clean shot. Take it. Roger that. Stevenson rooftop, 12 o'clock. Where's Christina?! Where's Christina? Somebody call the police! Oh, my God, oh, my God. - Stay in the car. Where is she? Where is she? Where is she?! We got his phone; let's get. We got to go. We got to go. - Let's go. She only uses the place in the winter, so we should be fine for a while here. (sighing And that's Deb. Were you guys in college together, too? Uh, no, just medical school. She's got a practice in New York and she comes down here once a year to teach a seminar. God, good for her. Nice family photos. Sand, sun, cheesy matching outfits. We could have that if we wanted someday. Stuart, take a seat. Scylla is in Miami. Our people are combing the city as we speak. Yes, I've heard. Someone's attempting a hostile takeover. Whoever has Scylla is trying to turn the cardholders against me. Oren tried to kill me yesterday. Jonathan We're dumping your cell phone. We've already found several phone calls between you and an unknown party. Stuart who has Scylla? I don't know. Think, buddy. Think. I swear I don't know anything. This can be as painless as you want it to be. Who has Scylla? You have gone around the bend on this. I haven't even started yet. Come on, Linc, this guy wasn't trying to hurt you. He just didn't like your tattoo. You're a funny guy, Self. - There's a lot of calls on the sniper's cell from a blocked number. We'll need the Company to help identify it. What if it's your mom's cell phone, Linc, and we have to pay a visit? You got the gumption? Yeah. Lincoln, I don't like having to initiate these calls. Well, don't. We'll call you when we get it. Who has Scylla? We don't know, but we tangled with a sniper. Whom you're interrogating right now, right? He's dead. Lincoln, the point of this action is not to kill as many of them as you can! Your methods make me question whether you are capable of playing on a field of this size. We'll get Scylla. I want answers today. Aren't you leaving something out, something a tad critical, like it's your mom who has Scylla, hmm? Don't think too much. - Let's talk about that. Let's talk about thinking too much, okay? Are you stonewalling the General 'cause it's good for the team here, or are you protecting the woman who popped you out lo these many years ago, huh? If Krantz didn't put you here, I'd kill you. All right, all right! There's my answer. - If we tell Krantz that Christina has it, he may know things that'll help us or he may determine that we're no longer useful. Everybody understand that? We're here to get Scylla, we need Scylla, and the way to do that is to stick to the plan and to keep our mouths shut. Hey, look at this. Yesterday he found us on Interstate 10, near Route 4 in Arizona. And "MS" are your initials. Yeah, but the rest of this could mean anything. I'll do a search on Rockwell and we'll figure it out. Assuming Lincoln hasn't already. He's been here three days and he's got access to Company resources. And once he puts his mind to something, that's it, even if he figures out he's wrong. Well, and from what I've gathered, he doesn't think he is wrong, so If I'm MS, then who's VS? Nomaashkaar, kaam No Nomaashkaar, kaam. Bengali has It's a bitch to pronounce. Lincoln got away. Have you ever seen a picture of a supernova? I have. They're quite beautiful, aren't they? They're very rare; they only occur about once every 50 years. We're a day away from a kind of supernova. A moment so powerful it'll eclipse everything. And nobody's going to stop me. No? They haven't got it yet. Well, I've sent it twice already. Either they They got it. They got it. Okay. We need you to trace who called the sniper's cell and tell us where he is in Miami. Well, when? No. Hell, no. We need it now. We Hour earliest. What do you mean, hour? We get him, we get to Christina. Damn well almost got our asses handed to us getting these. You want to know what your mama's up to-- let's start there. These things are for tomorrow. I want Scylla today! Oh, sorry there, Sink. There I go thinking again. My bad. Why? I'm getting you out of here. What is it? - It's Michael. He's in Miami, wants to meet. When? Never. I warned him not to come. Hello, Alex. Glad to see you're both in one piece. Where's my brother? He's not coming. So you're working with him now? You work for the Company? Sure. Fine. Why are you here? Partly to warn you. I could have saved you the trip. 'Cause we're seeing this thing through. What do you know? What do you think you've walked into? You tell me. Your mother. She has Scylla. Whoever's going to get it has to go through her. I need to talk to my brother. He's not coming. He's a little too busy trying to stay alive because your because your mother tried to kill him. And if you stay here with some half-baked plan, she's gonna try and kill you. What are you doing here, Alex? I'm trying to get some information, anything that can help. You need to trust me. - So that you can run back to the General with it? Everybody can get what they want here. We don't have to chose between saving our families and taking down the Company. We can do both. How? I'll know when we get there. That's why I'm asking you, please, trust me. Now, do you know anything? Do you have anything? The only thing I can tell you is that we're gonna burn the Company down to the ground, and that's with or without you, Alex. I'm sorry, Michael. About your mother. So, the guy who was posing as a cop yesterday must have been working for my mother. Yeah. Yeah, I think you're right. And if he was following her instructions, that means Guess that means she wanted the two of us transported somewhere. At least she didn't want us killed. I guess I should be grateful. Does this change anything? No. The fact that she thrived within the Company, at the expense of everyone else mes me want to take them down even more. Okay. Rockwell Avenue, South Miami. Let's go. All right, the SIM card information the Company gave us said this guy should be a couple of blocks over. This better be the guy who ordered the hit on you, Linc, not some pizza delivery boy. - Why don't you just shut up? All right, listen, he's stopping. Lincoln, you're gonna make a right about a quarter of mile up. What's the location? I do. Whose seal is that? India. This is the embassy. All right, there he is. And look who he's with. She's got Scylla. We need to get in there. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, if she's going in, she's gonna come back out. And when she does, we take our shot. One thing I learned at Fox River-- just 'cause something goes in, don't mean it always comes back out. You're right. Hark, what was that? One more time? Look, she's got that thing on her. We need to move now. We need to create a distraction. Ready to go, T-Bag? No, no, no, no. Well, what do you want me to say? Run your mouth. You know how to do that. Look, when we get in, we'll let you know. Until then, you keep 'em busy. Oh, come on, Donnie. I don't know about this. Excuse me? Excuse me. I'd like a meeting with your president, sir. Uh could you notify him I'm here? Thank you. The president doesn't live in America, sir. She lives in Kashmir. She? Oh, well. That explains a lot, don't it? Listen, Haji, I got no beefs with you, okay? It's just, there comes a point when a thinking man has to take a stand. You know who else thinks? Elephants. That's right. Elephants. You know, they have the largest brain in the whole animal kingdom? Did you know what? Come on, Bagwell. Sir You folks have a history of mistreating these mighty creatures, and up till now, no one's been lifting a finger. Up till now. This is private property, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Well, I'm not going anywhere. Ha! - Unlock those now! This is station four. I have a code 11. Bring it! Security camera's looking good. Let him go. Let's move. Sir? Sir? America's on the other end of that sidewalk. You're on international soil. For your sake, I hope you brought the keys for that. I have no-no gripes with you at all, okay? I've been calling my congressman. I've been writing United Nations. I don't care. Did you know that elephants eat over 500 pounds of food per day?! And their dung-- it can be it can be processed into parchment. You're about to be in a big heap on that, sir. Elephant! - Front gate now. Elephant! Let's go. All right, let's go. I'm gonna text Bagwell and let him know we're in. All right. After 9/11, DHS implemented some new protocol regarding - Just hurry up. It's an abomination. That's what it is. It's an abomination. Why, the elephants, next to the chimps, have the closest DNA sequence as us human beings. Sir, I don't think that's true. Sorry to inconvenience you guys. Your ride's here, pal. Take him. Hey! Hey! Boys! Boys! This is just a misunderstanding. They're going to take you down to visit your buddies at the zoo. Bagwell's in trouble. - Are we made? We're not waiting around to find out. Let's go. We got about ten seconds before we go live all over this place. Come on. Okay, here we go. Let's go. Looks good over here. Clear here. We got to hurry. Have you ever seen the Taj Mahal? Only in photographs. You? Several times. It was built by the Shah Jahan for his favorite wife. I remember telling that to my ex-husband. Do you know what his reply was? Nomahkaar, kaamon aachen? That's very sweet, Christina. I'm fine, thank you. Please. - Thank you. I'm sorry for all the extra security, but as I'm sure you realize, there's a lot of people who would like to get their hands on this. Mm. This is an overview of the solar cell prototype. That's just the beginning of what's on here. A desalination technique that can yield potable water within seconds. Hmm. Bioengineered crops that will subsist in the harshest of climates. Revolutionary vaccines. Well, you know, that there's a rumor floating about that this belongs to General Krantz. That eight-carat purple diamond your lovely wife wears on her hand. Did you worry out which South African country it was taken from? The profit margin would be split fifty-fifty. Your country would handle the manufacturing and distribution. I would act as your silent partner. Please. Have a seat. Last resort. We clear? No, he's not clear. We fire off a shot in here, not getting out. Are we clear? We're clear. I sense there's something that you're not telling me. All you have to do is show up at the Progressive Energies conference tomorrow, go up on the dais, and present this technology as your own. So, I'm the one who looks like the fool if this venture fails. The leading minds of this world will be at that conference tomorrow, working on the crisis that we are facing with our planet. You will have the solution. You will be a visionary. Dr. Vincent Sandinsky has done extensive research on the bargain theory. Says that proof of its practical application is pretty shaky. He's giving a lecture tomorrow at the conference and I'd like to make sure that his findings don't debunk the foundation of our project before we even get off the ground. Naveen, the technology that I am offering you will catapult your country Naturally, a few other countries have expressed some interest. I'm sure that they would be happy to sell you this information at three times the price in a few years. This is all very sudden. Well, as I said, I only acquired this recently. But I assure you, it is going to sell. I came to you first out of respect to your father. I will just say one more thing Mm-hmm. then I will let you do what you like. What do you think your father would have done with this offer? I need a minute. And don't worry about Sandinsky. He won't be a problem. This is 48 Rockwell. Uh, we need B23. Row D. Row B. B23. This is it. Fernando was a great influence on you, huh? And vice versa. Here we go. Car keys. So, there's no itinerary, but we do have a map to the Everglade Memorial Airport. And we have a gun. I've been thinking about this. "V" and "S" are someone's initials. What if our guy wasn't flying out, but someone named VS was flying in. I found one of our guys. Good. He'll take us to Christine. Now where are you? - Second floor. Near the atrium. Don't move! Freeze! and two male suspects in custody. We need to clear out. Excuse me? Lincoln's in the building. I need close this deal. Preferably without looking like an amateur. Handle it. Get in there. Move! Get on your knees, put your hands on your head. Get down. Understood. Move an inch and I won't hesitate to kill any of you. I think we've come to a decision. You honor your side of the agreement and I will do the unveiling at the conference tomorrow. That's great news, Naveen. Great news. Thank you. - Thank you. Let's go. Is there another way out of here? Huh? He just said don't go near the door. This is an embassy. Christina can't risk an incident, just like we couldn't. Nobody's going to kill us. Let's go. I don't know how the hell they found us. All I care about is Sandinsky. Is Morris on his way? We haven't heard from him yet. I'll check his status. Here, give me that. Who are you gentlemen with? Christina. Here. She dropped this. We're about a mile away. Is that you? I think it's coming from inside the briefcase. Private caller. Can they track us on this thing? Put it on speakerphone. Hello? Michael? Was that your mom? Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry. I don't even know what to say. There's nothing to say. Nothing at all. What the hell happened to you? Where's Scylla, huh? They left before we could get it. I got the ass kicking of a lifetime and you come back empty-handed? We got this. A Post-it note?! That's what you got? How about some Elmer's Glue? Did you get any of that? Would you calm down. This is important to us. If we had just told the General just told the General One more time. Hey, if this guy's important to Christina, he's important to us. Hey, let's call the Company, get a read on him. I'll do it. You all right? - Yeah, I'm good. I'll be right out. Whoever VS is, their plane gets in in less than 30 minutes. We need to g our hands on that flight log. Sure. Hi. Um, sorry, I notice you have a sign up there that says I can learn to fly here. Do you have a brochure I can take a look at? Let me call you back. Sure, I should have one around her somewhere. Thank you. There you go. Okay. "Learn how to fly." This is perfect! Michael. There was an exit by the bathrooms. I need 30 seconds. They will kill us if they find us. Vincent Sandinsky. VS. N727MG. Let's go. Got it. Vincent Sandinsky's on a plane right now. He's heading into Everglade Memorial Airport. We got 15 minutes to get to Fort Lauderdale. With traffic, there's no way we're going to make it. Then stay. Excuse me, can I help you? Funny you should ask. I need you to call up to the tower with a message for N727MG. N727MG. This is Everglade Memorial tower. We just got word from another craft that your port side turbine's trailing black. Tower, I'm clear across the board here. Am I still good for landing? Now tell them he needs to land at the north end of the tarmac and follow emergency protocol. But that'll Tell them. Do you copy? Tower, this is operations. Have November-Seven- Two-Seven-Michael-Golf approach from the southwest. We're not gonna take any chances. We're gonna send a crew out to them. Have the passengers evac as soon as they hit the ground. Roger that. Now call down to security. Tell them Dr. Sara Tancredi needs to be let on the tarmac. One of your passengers has had a heart attack. He needs immediate assistance. Security, this is operations. Okay. One more mine, and I'll be out of your hair. Hey. You could be getting in big trouble for this, guy. You could go to prison. Which one? Something's going on here. I'm not sure what the problem is. Vincent Sandinsky? Yes? Hi. Dr. Tancredi. Sir, I need you to come with me. - Is there something wrong? Uh, we have some concerns about some health exposure you may have experienced during the flight. I'm sorry, I don't Let's go. Michael Scofield, Vincent Sandinsky. Get in the car. Why - Back seat. Get in! Please don't hurt me. I won't. But they will. You can take everything I have. Just please let me go. Do you know who Christina Scofield is? Who? No. Michael, I'm running out of road. Head for the hangars. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. What's going on here? Get out of the car! Now! Michael - Get out of the car! Oh, my God, oh, my God. - Move it! We should do what they say. - Move it! Come on, before they kill us. Let's just do what they want. Let's just do what they want before they kill us, please. Get down. Get down now! Now. Put him in the car. What do we do with these two? Kill them. You okay? Yeah. Thanks to you, I guess. Hey. Get out. Here, move it. Where are you taking me? - Move. What's going on? - Go, move! But where are you taking me? - Move it! What do you want to do with me? Stop talking and start walking. This is a mistake. Lincoln, have you lost your mind? But what's going on? Just get in the car now. What are you gonna do? Shoot me? I warned you not to come, Michael. I'm doing this for us, the family. Well, it's not over. Not by a long shot. What? I got some information for you. But I want to make sure that everything we talked about is still heading my way. The car, the office and the house. Bagwell, if you're jerking me around You trying to talk me out of it? Just tell me. Linc and Michael's mother. She's got Scylla. Here in Miami. And, General Fuel the jet. We're going to Miami. Christina Rose Scofield. That name mean anything to you? No. Then why was she holding on to your flight information? I have no idea. You ever heard of the Company? No. Company! You never heard of the Company? You ever heard of Scylla? What do you do for a living? I'm a professor at Dartmouth. What are you doing in Miami? I, uh I just wanted to get out of New Hampshire for a few days. To be honest, right now I wish I hadn't. Just relax. I got a call from the organizing committee of the Progressive Energies conference that's here tomorrow. They said they would fly me out and put me up in a hotel if I gave a short presentation. Where's your cell? Uh it's-it's in my jacket. Why are you lying to me? I had it when I got off the plane. I swear to God. Yeah, Michael, he said he doesn't know your mom, but there's got to be forth between them. They don't just know each other. They're working together. The question is, on what? Linc. Vincent Sandinsky. What about the last number dialed? There's a lot of calls from that number. I'll be right back. Anything? Not yet. Yes? How badly do you want him, Mom? Michael, listen to me. That's not an answer. I'll be in touch. His story checks out. Listen, there are still some things we need to figure out, but as soon as we do, we'll let you go. Thank you.
