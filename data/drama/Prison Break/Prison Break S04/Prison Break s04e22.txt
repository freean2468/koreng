Killing Your Number



                    			You know, someday, weeks will go by, maybe even years, it won't even cross our minds. We'll come home, and we'll talk about work. And what we want for dinner movies. Nursery schools. It's going to be great. Yeah. Yeah, all we got to do is survive. We will. I promise. What happened? Nothing. The detonator must have failed. Distract them. We'll be there in five minutes. No, we don't have five seconds, Michael. Then you'll have to trigger it manually. How much time is that gonna give me? Out. Now. Alex? Alex?! It's wiped clean. That's not possible. - Really? Well, then where is it? Where's the data? It was intact when I took it. I'll tell you what, If it doesn't boot up in ten seconds, I'm gonna splatter your skull all over these walls. I came to you. I want this over. Why would I jeopardize that? I don't believe that Michael just let you have it. He didn't-- he left me alone in a room, and I took it. And that wasn't the least bit suspicious to you? Maybe. I I don't know. Or you're lying. Kill the junkie. Oh! You pathetic slug. Sara was the only leverage we had. Scofield's donned many a chapeaux, but human fly? I should anticipate him scaling the building? Move on Panama. Proffer your nine. Men in my employ, Bagwell anticipate. They cover their bases. They refuse to fail-- which you seem to do with unyielding consistency. That's got to be Sara's phone. I should answer it. What do you got to lose, General? Yello? Who the hell is this? Is this Fernando Sucre? Oh, thank you, God. Bagwell? Yeah. And we're on the same team, brother, same team. Our boys are in a hell of a pickle. Where's Michael? Uh, his mother snatched him and Tancredi. Linc, too-- and I personally took a nasty beat-down. Where does she have them? I got an idea, but I can't say on the phone. I'm running scared, amigo. Okay, cool it. You know what? Um, we got somebody who can help us out, but I need to get ahold of Michael. We should, uh, we should get together and pool our resources. The park on 72nd Avenue, uh, in an hour? Okay, I'll be there. Excellent, perfecto. He's got someone who can help on his cause, I'm certain can draw out Scofield. You're certain of nothing. Yet I do have a sit-down with Scofield's friend in an hour. You got no better hand, General. Your breathing is short. Does it hurt to inhale? I'm fine. - Hell, you've collapsed your lung. No hospital. Hospital means jail. Come on, Michael come on! Can you treat him? - I don't know. I need a better look before I can try. Christina? Buried. You are a sight for sore eyes, my friend. Can the reunion. Where can I find Michael and Lincoln? Admittedly, they're in dire straits. Are you deaf? Unlikely, amigo--  I just heard the dime drop on your sorry ass. And from the bench over my left shoulder, the gentlemen in the Wayfarers? Just like in Fox River, you never thought things through. Now, are you gonna name the friend who said he'd show up and help out the brothers? No. You're gonna hand Sara's phone, or I'll break your face. Accuse me of being deaf, but you're the one that's going blind, Puerto Rican. The man's a Company operative trained assassin. What's up, Jethro? We're a long way from Fox River, T-Bag. Let's go. Yeah, I got Tancredi's phone. Paging Dr. Bender. Do you know if he's diabetic? On some medication he may have missed? I have no idea. Any chance he's faking it? No. His pupils are dilated. He needs a head CT stat, EKG and a chest X-ray. He may have bled into his brain or had a heart attack. Franco. It wasn't just Scofield and Burrows; this is the team that Self had at the warehouse. Former federal agent. Yeah, Self was into something nasty. Agent Self, can you hear me? Agent Franco, we have to move him. Where are Scofield and Burrows? We're going now. His finger moved. He can hear me. Agent Self, can you help us? He's not going anywhere. Michael, what's the plan? Who do we trust? No one. We're out of options. Destroy Scylla. Is that it? Is that where we're at? What if the General decides to retaliate? He will even if we give it to him. We can crush it, incinerate it, throw it in the ocean. All three sound good. Alex? All right. Then it's decided. Hello. Hello, Michael. You're a tough man to get ahold of. Kellerman! I heard you were dead. Those rumors were greatly exaggerated. No, I was, um freed by a group working against the Company. The same group founded by your father. I'm working with them. Could've used a hand, Paul. Do you have Scylla? What do you think? I think you do. Michael, there is a UN attach√©, who will be in Miami today at 5:00 to receive Scylla from you. Why should I trust a word coming out of your mouth? I assume you know that what you have can-- and this is no exaggeration-- change the world for the better. All you have to do is deliver it. And you don't need to trust me; just trust the people that work at the United Nations. The phone died. He's not getting any better. - All right, come on. Let's get him up. I got to get some supplies. Yeah. Okay. That was Kellerman. This Alabama trailer trash has been making good. He hooked up with General Krantz. What's it to you, rughead? Well, where is the General now? Same place as your daddy. Location unknown. Do you remember that day we were in the chow line, Fox River, you made that offhanded comment to me? I believe it had a racial bent to it. Yeah. Do you remember your broken jaw? Now, just imagine what I can do to you right now with something real on the line. Such as? We need the General's location. What's in it for me? If we take Scylla to the place it's supposed to be, there'll be an immunity list. You could be on it. - No. Where I'm sitting, albeit momentarily compromised, you're backing the wrong horse. Scofield cannot pull this out. You help me get him to the General and we are set for life! Man, I don't have time for this, man. Time? It's time you backed a winner for once, my chocolate friend! Ow! Sit down! Now where is the General? Where is the General? No word from Agent Frost or Bagwell. That slippery little rat. If he's AWOL, I'll skin him alive. No way he got over on Frost. He's he's captured or dead. So we're exposed here. Is this the end? Whimpering? There's no shame in retreating to regroup, sir. That, son, is a tremendous load. Yeah? Lincoln Burrows' phone pinged a cell tower downtown. We have his location. Then what are you doing here? You holding up? You're going to give Scylla to Kellerman? I don't know. Do you trust him? No. The thought of walking free from this sounds pretty good right now. I mean, that-that was the goal. It's right across town. If you have to leave, Michael, you should. I'm not leaving you, Linc. You're my brother. Not according to Christina. Don't let her mess with your head. Well, maybe it's true. I keep I keep playing things over in my head from-from our childhood Doesn't matter what she said. It doesn't change anything. You're stuck with me whether you like it or not. The doc said the CT scanner is free. We got to take him now. No, he stays till he talks. He's worse than he was ten minutes ago. He won't be talking anytime soon. Yeah, but you can write, can't you, Don? So you give me what I need, and you'll get top-notch care and a pension. Or you can waste away in front of us until you have the brain capacity of a peanut. Your choice. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, come on. Excuse me, um May I speak to you for a second? Paging Dr. Stateman. Dr. Stateman, please. Alex was arrested. Federal agents. We need to get him. If we give Scylla to Kellerman, Alex gets exonerated. He's fine. He's fine. We need to get the fluid out. It should ease the pressure and help him breathe. Can you hold that? That won't last long, but we can go. Mind if I drive? In two minutes, your eyeballs are gonna pop out of your head. Now, that's worse than death. I can't betray. My destiny is to be a respected gentleman. Where's the General, you son of a bitch?! Battered and bruised. Staring death in the face. Surprising that you still need more assurance that you've come to the end of the line. We don't have Scylla. Michael your brother is dying. It's fascinating watching the blood drain from his face. Do you suppose that he would like to see that happen to his girlfriend? Sofia You give me Scylla or he can sit there and watch as Sofia's throat is slit. The gun that killed Naveen Banerjee. We pulled Lincoln Burrows' thumbprint off the stock. We got video of you outside the crime scene with Burrows. Isn't that a coincidence? Lincoln didn't kill Banerjee. He was set up. By whom? It was the Company. The Company-- you know what I'm talking about? They've developed a device that's called Scylla. If you want to see the light of day again as a free man, you'll give us Scofield and Burrows - You're missing what's right in front of your face! The brothers didn't kill anybody. You say you're here 'cause you want to do the right thing? Then listen to me. Listen to what I'm telling you. Scofield and Burrows. Where are they? Sofia Granted, it is a dreadful decision. You have me. I don't really care about you, Lincoln. I just want my property. All right. Let's say I do know where it is. Why should I tell you? You're just gonna kill us anyway. True, you and your brother are walking dead, but if I get Scylla within the next half hour, I'll release Sofia. And what about Sara? We're negotiating for Sofia right now. I want you to let her go. And I want a decision, Michael. Let her go! All right. Don't move. Let Sofia go. Now. Make the call. Stand down. Just let her walk. Yes, immediately! All right. And this is where we say good-bye. Michael, no. Kill him. No. We leave. Listen to her, Michael. Kill him. I'm just an old man who's lost everything. You win, Michael. And you, Lincoln. You win, Michael! You both win. Because it's all just a game, isn't it? When you get to be as old as I am, Michael, should you survive so long, you, too, will see that's exactly what it all is-- a game. Kill him. Listen to me, huh, just listen to me. I didn't risk everything to come down here for revenge. I'm here to clear my name. Do you have Scylla? Yes. Then let's go. Come on, General. Never thought I'd be so happy to see you. Tell me something. - Yeah? Are you sure we can trust Kellerman? You know, the only thing I'm sure of is that he's our last option. Gentlemen, we gotta leave. Wait for me! Michael? Freeze! I'll shoot! Go! Go! Michael, go. He's not going to make it much longer without a hospital. No. Not till this is done. Hey, Linc, I need your phone. Here. Dial Kellerman's number. Don't tell me you're getting cold feet. Just dial it, please. It's voice mail. And you'd better come through for us in the end. Yeah, he will. Yeah, well We know him a little bit better than you do. Be sure to turn the phone off. That's how Krantz found us before. And somebody already has. Yo, hey, hey, get out, get out! Get out! Get out! Just make the call. Get Scofield or Burrows or whoever they're in business with. Get them on the phone. This is your last chance before we take the deal to Mahone. If Mahone was talking, you guys wouldn't be here. What kind of man are you? I mean, you got your woman and your baby up north. Don't you want to look out for them? Don't you want to get their back? Why the hell you gonna give all that up for two guys you did time with? Unless something went down at Fox River that we don't know about. - Are you guys blind?! Don't you see, they're trying to do something that's bigger than all this. Then you're dumber than you look. Are you going to make the call or not? Last chance. No. Drop it! Where do you think you're going? Turn around slowly. Drop the gun. Do it now. Michael, when you were eight years old - Save it. I don't care. Drop the gun. Put Scylla on the ground, and I'll let you walk out of here. If you don't I'll kill you. You can't kill your mother, Michael. You were never my mother. And I'm no longer your son. Fine. Then pull the trigger. Don't tempt me. Pull the trigger, Michael. Do it for Lincoln. Drop the gun! You can't do it, can you? Oh dear. Misfire. You were born a Scofield but you'll die a Burrows. Okay? I have to get Lincoln to the hospital. I'll get this to Kellerman. It's all on you again. Thank you. Ooh sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Nice and easy. You're coming with us. Let's go. - Nice and easy. Stay calm. Sorry about all of that. I had to make sure you weren't followed. Solomon Okella from United Nations-- he's the man to get that thing done. Lincoln. Sara. Mahone, Sucre. Exonerated-- all of them. I'm telling you, it's okay. It's okay. Something's wrong. There's a piece missing. What the hell are you doing? How is someone from the UN supposed to get us exonerated here? You are wasting time, and we are all in danger. What is going on here, Paul? Need to know exactly who his contacts are in the U.S. Government. I've been telling everybody what a genius you are. Don't get stupid on me now. I'm not waiting. He either has it or he doesn't. Michael if you have it, please give it to me, and we can be done with all of this finally. And if you don't, fine but just tell me, so we can hurry up and run for our lives. I don't want to run anymore. Neither do I. I'll make the call. You did it. It's over. Hands up! Jonathan Krantz? General Jonathan Krantz. Put your hands behind your back. Sir. Okay, we got everything we need. We're done here. And this is it? There will be some follow-up interviews, but this is it. Sign it, and you're free to go. Can I keep the pen? Sure. Alex? Pam's been located. She's safe. Mr. Burrows, Sofia and LJ are safe, as well. Police station in Panama. Now, last bit of business, um, Bagwell, T-Bag claims he helped find Scylla. He was helpful here in Miami. He wants exoneration, as well. I can make that happen. I'll leave it up to you. "And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ forgave you." Ephesians 4:32. Let's forgive each other, Lincoln, Michael. In God's name, 'cause there's too much pain. There's too much hate in our hearts. We took a vote. You're in luck. Oh, lucky day. What we voted on was whether or not you took a stick of gum on the van ride back to prison. You rot in hell, both of you! I want you to know, I'm totally going to be a hands-on dad. Okay. Like, if the baby needs a bottle in the middle of the night, I will totally keep your side of the bed warm until you get back. Thank you. When do they start walking? Uh a year? We'd better get some baby books, because I plan on being the most overinformed dad in Chicago. No kidding. I'm happy right now. So am I. Oh. Thanks. I love you. I love you, too. When do you leave? Eight o'clock. I'm going to miss you. I'll be back soon. Did LJ make any decision? I made it for him. I told him to take his finals. Next year. Yeah. Always next year. All right, sweetheart. Love you. Mmm. Love you, too. Get home safe. I will. Hi. Daddy's going to come back in two days, okay? It's been a pleasure meeting you, Congressman Kellerman. And meeting you, as well. You fight those bastards in Washington. Don't let them give you any guff. You watch me. I'm not gonna. Anne, thank you for your support. It's all right. Thank you. Remember me, Paul? I'm Danny Hale's widow. Remember Danny? Of course, Allison. Danny was a true American hero. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. the captivity of negativity What's that? It's just this book I got. I don't ever want to see this book again. You hear? Yes, sir. Those right there. Right. Thank you so much. Michael, we got to go. Here. Oh, you're so tough. ¬øQuanto cuesta? ¬øTres? Here you go. Muchas gracias. Come on. Let's go see your daddy. Give me your hand. Thank you very much, sir. You want to do a skip? All right, I'll skip. # Skip down! # Then on three, biggest jump you got. One, two, three! Not two! On three! Buddy. Ooh! Oh, my goodness.
