                    			Previously on Prison Break LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler. Are we clear? - This can't be done in a week. - You have a week. That's it. No one's ever broken out of this place before, let alone with a week to plan, so, tell them I'm gonna break this guy out of here or I'm gonna die trying. You're going to stay on as my ears. You'll report back to me everything you hear when I'm not around. I know you've got a brother helping on the outside, He ran into my girlfriend, and he took a book from her that belongs to me. This is what they took from me. So let's be clear, this is what matters to me. Not you. And not your book. How's LJ? How's Sara? They told me they're fine. What are you not telling me? You're not the only one affected. They killed Sara and put her head in a box! And they got my son! J.P. Getty had a formula for success. "Rise early, "work hard, "strike oil." Just trying to get a drink of water, Alex. As a devoted student of your work and skills, I really look forward to progress on your plan, Michael. I'm looking forward to you getting off my back. Buenos, welcome to Sona. Is that your wallet? You know what I said. That's the wrong answer. I am so ready to get out of here anytime you are. You look like you had a long night. I spent most of it feeding chocolate to a rat. I don't have a whole lot to work with these days. She's got the book, man, the bird guide. - She worked it out. - So we have no leverage. Tell me something. When you were handing over the book, did you ask for a recent photo of LJ and Sara? And where is it? She showed me the pictures, but she wouldn't let me keep'em. I can't bargain with them. They're pissed. You break out tomorrow. Let's just focus on that. Let's keep on track. Alright. While I'm working from the inside, take care of what happens once we're outside. We're gonna need a getaway vehicle, something inconspicuous. Whatever you find, it has to be parked a 0.5 mile from here by 3pm tomorrow. - You mean am. - No, I mean pm. We don't have a choice, Linc. I ran some tests last night. Military jeeps patrol the perimeter at night. There's no way of telling where they're gonna be in the dark. They were out there all night. We need the dark, we can't just Please. Because we're doing this tomorrow. In the middle of the day. - Who're you looking at? - That guy. I know him. McGrady, my friend, I'm gonna need a watch. - Maybe two. - I'm not even gonna ask why. I'm also going to need some binoculars. Old Guillermo has a pair. There's no way he'll sell them to you. - But they shouldn't be hard to get. - Where can I find this guy? We leave tomorrow. This This is how we're getting out of Sona. Getting out of the cell block shouldn't be a problem. The grate and bars are weak, but we're going to need a rope, some kind of ladder, to let us down on the other side. That's why I figured out the safest line from here to the hole in the fence. We do it in the day, we'll only be visible to the 2 guard towers. The perimeter guards are less predictable, but they're only on at night. Cross the field in the middle of the day? It's the only way to avoid the jeep patrol. Now, in the yard tomorrow, there's a soccer game at 2:00. That should provide some distraction inside. Yesterday when we were digging, I saw the glare from the sun hit this guy in the late afternoon. Looked like he had turned away, like his vision was blocked. It's not much of a break. But it is one way to do what we need to do. As far as this other guard, his weakness has yet to be determined. If we're gonna get around these guys, we've got to get to know them. It's not gonna be easy. - There's only one real road - No real road that's not an option. What? - Your brother's cutting it close. - You said a week. Tomorrow's Wednesday, you can't do any errors. There won't be any "errors. " - I've got a lot of stuff to do and I - That's why I won't waste your time. When Whistler's free, I need to get to him quick. I'm still trying to work out what'll happen once they get past the fence. - Once I know all the details, I'll - Lincoln, calm down. It sounds to me like you and your brother are in over your heads. There's a bad joke about Sara somewhere in there. Listen I'll let you know all the details once I know them and then I'll call you. I want this to work out just as badly as you do. More, I'm sure. LJ's fine. You have 34 hours. - What did she say? - Nothing we don't already know. Let's get out of here; we got a lot of stuff to do. I wouldn't let'em see you do that. - Who? - Anyone. It's a drinking fountain. They put their lips on there. You'd think it spits straight Jack Daniels. You understand what happened? You're a what's it called? A pariah. I made the same mistake when I walked in here trying to hang on to my wallet. Next thing I knew, I spent the next In Sona, it's every man for himself. Here, cheese. - I'm not hungry. - Yeah, you will be. I saw the other Americans. None of you have called the embassy? Us gringos ain't all butt buddies. You want it? 'Cause I'll keep it. Let's get this done. We're gonna have to watch both guards simultaneously. Your cell should provide a good view of the guard I saw yesterday. Keep track of everything he does and when he does it. Look for that glare, see if it shows up again. - What will you be doing? - Watching the other tower from here. While our back's turned, we're gonna need a lookout. Well Find Mahone. - I thought we were stringing him along? - Looks like we're out of string. What they say about all work and no play? - Boy need his rest. - Your clientele keeps a tight schedule. Got to make sure I see to their needs. I gave you a more important task. - But I haven't heard a thing. - Then listen harder. Into my office. Sit down. Watch the game. Anything yet? Nope, not yet. So what's your story, man? The next chapter, when we get out of here. Suppose you were married to the job, drank too much, rabid insomniac, typical lawman. Yeah, just like you reek of live bait, have a girl in every port, tell fish stories or so I've heard. Prior to this experience, I had the utmost respect for the law. This guy hasn't so much as scratched his jock in an hour. It's not gonna be easy to get around that guy. Maybe not. We might just have a break. I'm gonna go check on Scofield. Sorry. - Did you see the glare? - Hit him hard at 3:13. He turned to his right and ignored everything to the west for 6 min, as far as I could tell. This guy thinks he's auditioning for Buckingham Palace. He's also a sports fan. He's got a TV. Twice in the last four hours, the signal went fuzzy. He had to turn to adjust the antennae. That's nothing we can count on. True. But there is a device we can build out of some pretty common materials. It's almost like a radio, except it transmits signals. Pardon me. - You're the new guy. - Yeah. And who are you? Not the new guy. So what's your deal? Public intoxication, tourist in trouble what is it? I don't like people asking too many questions when I did nothing wrong. - You're an innocent man. - As a matter of fact, yes. Is this your first time in prison? - Why? - Because it's obvious Rule number one: you mind your own business. - You hear me? - You might wanna do the same. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You got it? Go take a walk. When'd you meet your boyfriend, Whistler? My last year of school. I worked in this place in San Isabel. He used to come around by himself and sit down in a bar. Hitting on the waitress. That's romantic. He is! Every time he goes away, he brings me back a present. Like this. Those are from Sedona. His mother lives there in a retirement home. - What's going on? - Out of the car, Juan Bobo! - This is a private road. - I can explain! - What'd we do? - Shut your mouth, Americano. This is state property! No vehicles allowed! All roads within two miles of Sona are closed. - We didn't see any signs. - Where were you going? San Isabel. - San Isabel? - Yeah. It's your car? This road is not for tourists. If I ever catch you out here again, I'll remember you. - It ain't gonna happen again. - Okay, go on. - You okay? - Yeah. This is not gonna work. - Where's the coast from here? - I don't know, maybe 3 miles. Alright, time for plan B. Come on. Found some more of these. We can make rope out of this hammock. Come on. You don't wanna go in there. If you wanna get out of here, I do. Stay here. Move it! Come on! - Was it chained down? - It's hanging by a thread. - It'll have to wait. - It's 4:30. - We've got less than 24 hours. - We'll make it. - Tell me why. - What? Why can't they wait until the day after tomorrow? I don't know. I don't have all the answers. You don't know me, I don't know you, but it's your job to get me out of here. We'll come back later. - I'll take this as well. - Down here for the summer? That's what I thought, back in 1985. Two wives, 20 years later Want everything in here? Yeah, thanks. International waters far out? That's 12 nautical miles. - Is that gonna do it, here? - Yeah. $99.25. - Here. - Alright. - What did you get? - Supplies. - Can you pop the trunk? - Who am I gonna tell, honestly? You could be a Russian spy for all I know. Live out of this thing? I have to be prepared in case of an emergency. Well, we got an emergency. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me where we're going. - Solana Beach. - Why? They killed Sara. I'm trying to make damn sure they don't kill my son. You don't think for a second your boy's not on that list, stay here. I couldn't care less. What is it? It's Augusto. He won't pay the payment for you anymore. I went to him for payment like every Monday, and he said it's not his responsibility and that I should ask you. You tell Augusto I don't pay for sex. I know, I did. But what I do? I don't see anyone else Yeah? Well, neither do I. On the other side, when we get out of here, what's gonna happen? We'll meet someone from this company? Apparently. And then they're gonna kill me. You know that. If they wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead. - I don't see why they keep me alive. - It's like you said You've got something they want. Once I give it to them, I'll be no use to them. Right? I don't have all the answers. All I know is it's my job to get you out of here. Let's go. It's twofer Tuesday, my one-time special just for you. But there's a price. Lechero's getting pretty sensitive about the cash flow. Well, I'm a little short right now. No worries, Alex. I am not gonna leave you hanging, alright? I think we've just start you a tab. - How does a microwave is gonna help us? - I guess we'll find out. My third year in school, we studied electrical engineering with a focus on EMPs. That's electromagnetic pulses. If you hook up a power source to a transmitter, it generates a pulse. That pulse crashes anything electronic. What's that, like an intro into anti-terrorist tactics? Basically. They have to teach students how to defend their structures. Fortunately for us, that guard tower is It was engineered a long time ago. I'm guessing you always won the elementary science fair. Plug this in. Did it crash the telly? We're too far away. But it is doing exactly what we need it to. - Get out! - Why? They're coming in. The colonel's coming. You stay here. Do not let them see her. Do not! Colonel. We received no word of this! A rifle scope was seen from the tower. Capitán Hurtado saw it with his own eyes. That's impossible. There is a gun in your prison, and it was pointing at one of my men. We are going to find it. - This looks good. - For what? Have a seat. What am I supposed to doing here? Look like you're having fun. When was the last time you saw your son? You know, I don't automatically trust people either, but at least I can tell when they have good intentions. Good for you. You know, I'm not gonna try to prove myself anymore. You do your job, and I'll do mine. - You need something?- What? You need something? Good. Don't you worry. It's gonna be okay. - It's not. - I promise I won't let him find you in here. - Lechero hate me. - Lechero does not hate you. You hold a very special place in his heart. So many girls can take my place. He's smart. He knows you're better than them. You're a real woman. A woman of her own will, her own desire. You know what I am. In this world, sister, we are all prostitutes. You are a queen. Whose cell is that? In the corner? Is that your cell? You! Is that your cell? It's mine! It's mine. It's mine. I found this. It's not a weapon. I know what it is. Why were you watching me? I'm going to ask you one more time. Why were you watching me? - I wasn't watching you. - I saw you. - Answer! I don't know what you think you saw, but I wasn't watching you. I wasn't watching you. It's mine! Why were you watching him? I wasn't. I was I was watching birds. See? Why did you not speak up before? I I was scared. I was scared. Come on. Please, please. He's coming back up here. Now, don't worry. It's all going to be okay. You have a little mascara right there. You need to look pretty for Lechero. Wait right here. A patrol passed through, but didn't stay. Knocked some things over then walked away. I hid your woman in a safe place, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a close call. Is she alone? Don't be afraid. No, no, my dear. They're gone. I should go, too. - No. What's the rush? Come on. - No, I should get home. I gave her the money. I was gonna replace it myself at the end of the day when I get my cut. I just didn't get a chance to tell you. She had no money to get home. Is this true? Yes. With all due respect. Surely you don't want your mistress traveling broke. She'd end up in a taxi with no way to pay the cab fare. Ah, you did this for me? Si, patrón. The one that does all the useful things for me, huh? And now you do the thinking for me. No, no, it's not like that Get the bucket. Wash my feet. So what do we do now? I don't know. - I'm afraid that's not good enough. - Please just give me a moment to think. Wasting time is not an option. I need to be out of here by tomorrow. Just in time for your next fishing trip, - or is it a bird-watching trip? I forget. - It's my trip log, I've told you. I need to retrace my steps. I'm doing everything they tell me, same thing you are. Just, just leave me alone, please. You know, before I was arrested, a man came to my flat and took my addresses. They know the name of everyone I care about and how to find them. They already found everyone I cared about. If you can't get me out of here, let me know, because time is running out. Look, it's hot today. Prefer the heat than the cold any day. You know my brother and I wanted to come down here to Panama and start a dive shop like the one we were at today. My boy, he was gonna leave school and help us start the family business. When this is all over, why don't you do it? Too much bad stuff's happened. Still, you can make it work. It's only gonna work if If Whistler cooperates. If he plays games, people get hurt. You understand that, right? He doesn't want anyone to get hurt. I hope you're right. I want to show you something. Our getaway vehicle. Now, the next time you see him, I want you to tell him what you saw. Tell him we're all in this together. We're part of a team. You understand? Alright, get up. We're coming back. No, this way. This way, come on. If all goes well, we'll see them tomorrow. If we're gonna do this today, we got to replace everything we lost. - Like what? - For starters, a new exit point. It's got to be on the south side of the building. Look at this guy, again. - I know you, huh? - Afraid not. You're McFadden, right? Nice, 1997? Sorry. You confused me with someone else. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I swear. You were with the ambassador. You've mistaken me for someone else. Chap's insane. Come on, guys, got something to show you. I'm sure I didn't observe the guards' behavior in as much detail as you guys, but I did notice something, yesterday. Right around this time. That's the day shift. They start up at 6:00. Just keep looking, keep looking. There. Where'd you get your cup, Alex? I got it in the courtyard, but apparently it's from him. He has one in the morning and one after lunch. Man's got to have his fix. - If we get to that cup - We get to the man. We got to move.
