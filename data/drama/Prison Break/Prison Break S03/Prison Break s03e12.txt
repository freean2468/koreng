Hell or High Water



                    			Previously on Prison Break We leave tonight. It's got no electricity and no running water. - A hundred bucks a month. - Deal. Ready? I hope this works, papi. That book, it's just a bunch of coordinates in there, right? Among other things. Does your father still have that phone number I gave you? - I think so. - Tell him to call my brother. - Papa, make that call for my friend. - The American? If time runs out, and I don't have the second half of those coordinates, LJ and the señorita stop breathing. Just wish there was another way to do this. To save LJ without handing Whistler over. Look, man, that's it, there isn't. - What is that? - Kesslivol. When heated to a certain degree, it eats through steel. As soon as Linc cuts the power, we go. What about the backup generator? There's a lag from when the power cuts out to when the generator kicks in. How long a lag we talking about? We only have 30 seconds. Go. Move it, move it! Let's go. - Okay, let's go. - Not yet. We have to go. We're running out of time! Trust me. Come on, mate. - What's the holdup, Michael? - Just a little bit longer. - What happened? - They got caught. - What's going on? - Shut up. Don't try anything. Bring 'em over here! You, on your knees, get down! Don't move, or you're like your friend over here. What's going on, Michael? This sure as hell better work out. For everyone's sake. You two, on your feet! - Where the hell's Scofield? - Shut it. If Scofield doesn't get caught, he could still fix this mess. And now? The lights are on, they know about the escape - What's your plan? - This is the plan. How the hell is getting caught your plan? You told them they had 30 s, but you knew the generator would start sooner. - I must have miscalculated. - We've got 10 mins till the sun rises. There are soldiers out there. They'll count. We gotta get back to the yard. We're not going anywhere. It's almost time. - What are you doing? - Nothing. it's just probably my wife. We live a couple miles away, she must have heard the sirens, so You can make your calls when I'm done with you. What else you got? - I'm not here. Say what you got to say. - Sucre, where the hell are you? We're counting on you to be here! If you're not there, we're dead, man. Now call me back, please. Put these with his personal effects. - What's going on out there? - Some prisoners tried to escape. Did they get out? They got caught. One of them got shot pretty bad. No, it is Alphonso Gallego. You where you need to be? I left the car on the side of the road. The keys are in the wheel well. Check if they're still there. - They're here. - Good, good. You will be here too, On the 312? Yeah, yeah, the 312. See you there. - These all the men? - Si, señor. Tell me, how did you get out there? How did you get out there? You don't want to tell me? How did you get out there? A tunnel. Where? Under Lechero's room. Show me. - How much longer? - It's just a matter of seconds now. The door. - I don't know the combination. - Then improvise. This is insane. Let's go. Hurry! This son of bitch sold us out. It wasn't me, it was Scofield! Just check the yard! Him, Whistler, Mahone and that basketball kid, none of them will be there. This is captain Sojo. Other inmates are missing. I want a post-and-protect around the entire perimeter of the prison. General, we see no one. Are you sure there's prisoners out here? You won't find the prisoners here in no-man's-land. Because they're already gone. Off the bus now! Get off the bus! - What's wrong? - My ankle! I've torn it apart! Come on. It's not that far. Help me out! We'll drag you by your hair because we got to go! - I'll slow you down. Go! Leave me! - We both know that's not an option. It's only a quarter of a mile to the beach. We stick to the bush,²we'll make it. - A little help? - Let's Go. Come on! We only have a few minutes. The soldiers're right behind. - Cops too. - We got what we need? - Yeah. - What do we need? Always picking up the strays, huh? This way. Michael, if you think the company will let you swap me - for your nephew, you're mistaken. - Shut up. Once they have me, they'll kill all of you. And I don't want Sofia caught in the crossfire. Listen, just let me go. I'll contact them, I promise. I'll say I'll turn myself in once I know LJ's safe. You got no say in what happens to my son! Got it? We don't need a suntan. We need to get lost. - They patrol all the roads around. - You didn't consider a boat? They show up here and we're 10 yards off the shore, we're target practice. - We need to be invisible. - Five guys, four tanks. Sucks for you, Mahone. Lincoln and I will share. Toss your boots in the box. - Tell me you have him. - Yeah, I got him. - Where's my son? - With me. Put him on the phone now. Say something. I'll be there soon. Just don't hurt anyone. Happy? You have 20 min to meet me in Panama City - where we agreed. - We'll be there. I need to put my book in there. My book? My book! - It must have fallen out of my pocket. - I thought you found the coordinates. I didn't memorize them! - I'm sure they're still looking for us. - It's gone. Get in the water. Would you please? It's a picture of my son. Can you put it in the bag? Screw you, Mahone. Let's go. McGrady! McGrady? - I don't swim so good. - What? Too bad, kid. You're getting wet. Get in. It's OK. We'll share tanks. Hold on to me, and we'll switch off back and forth, Where's Scofield? I don't know! He didn't tell me nothing! - Where is he running? - I told you, I don't know nothing! There's only one way to make certain of that. This is general Mestas. The men will be sent. And, Sojo, I expect every prisoner to be returned to Sona today. Dispatch fourth platoon. Look, man, this is getting crazy here. I'll plead guilty for ignoring the warrant. I'll show up for the court hearings. Let me get out of here. These alarms and the guns make me a little nervous. Until things settle in, you go nowhere. So just sit tight. There! Where is he? Where is he? - Where's who? - Sucre with the boat! Just hold on. You all right? You all right? - Come on, hang on. - I'm all right. We're not gonna make it out here too much longer. Sucre is coming. Be patient. Excuse me? Boat 3-12, why is it still here? Wasn't someone supposed to take it out today? Someone reserved it, but they never picked it up. - Yes, general. - I want an update. Still no sign of them. Nothing on the coast. They may have gone back into the jungle. The jungle? You asked me to send men to the beach! Captain Just a moment, general. General, I think we have to call the coast guard. Come on! Come on! You all right? - My legs are starting to cramp. - You gotta hold on, buddy. - We won't last out here too long. - Where's your friend? Sucre's not just gonna abandon us out here, all right? He'll show! The coast guard is launching four vessels If they were in the water all this time, they must have drowned by now. Well, look it here! We have more than a drunk and disorderly warrant for Jorge Rivera. Failure to pay child support. You're not going anywhere. Once we're done processing you, you can go. Until then, sit tight. I should have heard something by now. I've lost all damn track of them. Burrows will eventually reach out if he wants his son back. Well, that might no longer be an option. Look! Look! He's supposed to be flashing a light. He's not responding. The coast guard. They found us. Papa! Put your arm around me. Michael, if I don't get another chance, I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done. You're welcome. Come on, son. - How'd you find us? - You never showed, and you said you'd be coming from the southwest, so I took a chance. - What do you think happened to Sucre? - I don't know, but we gotta move. Guess that just leaves one. Get up. Let's go. I saw the boxes in the back, so I took your car. Figured you'd need to change. - How's the ankle? - I need to get off my feet. All right, get changed and make sure you don't leave any wet clothes behind. Listen - Thanks for everything. - Thank you for my boy. I hope you get your son back, too. Yeah, me, too. Come. We need to get back to the truck. Thank you. Go be with your family, Luis. Where the hell are you? We ran into some trouble. We're downtown Panama. No, Lincoln, you're not. We got company. How'd they find us? - You have them? - We're right on top of them. Hold on! They must've gotten to McGrady's dad - and bugged this car. - Or one of us. Then why didn't they find us when we were in the water? Because the water was blocking the signal. What you do with that stopwatch that Gretchen gave you? My God. I didn't know! I didn't know! Hold on, guys! All right, it's time to use this rig to our advantage. Here we go! This is looking like a dead end right here. Stay in the car, then. This way! Why don't you just tell us what you know? Then you won't wind up being beaten half to death like your friend. I know less than you do! Which is hard, considering how dumb you are. I want everything you can find on the men who escaped immediately. Go see the clerk about your stuff. They're barricaded. What are you doing? Get back! All that gunfire and they only hit your car three times? Son of a bi You did great, getting us out of the frying pan, but it'll be for nothing if we go back. Not fire, just an exchange, then I'm done with you. - It's that simple for you? - Yeah, they want you, they get you. - Simple. - I'm talking about Sofia and your son! Tell him these people won't just let us walk away! We already had this discussion back at the beach, and you were outvoted. You're making a terrible mistake. People might die because of this. Take off your pants. Excuse me, señor? I said take off your pants. If I knew you boys partied in Sona like this, I never would have tried to escape. One cell phone. One wallet, and some change. There were some papers. A boat-rental agreement. I need them. I'll check the drawer. Take them down. Come on, hombre. - There's no need to refry my beans. - Always with the wise talk. Never saying anything we want to hear. Now, all I want to hear are your screams. No, listen. I told you, I don't know nothing. No, I told you, I don't know nothing. I swear I don't! But he does! He knows everything! He knows everything! Not so fast, mí amigo. A little help. What is this place? The place for the exchange. On our terms. There's a road out back in case we need to go. - If we're still alive. - You still talking? Gotta commend you on that boom box trick. Very sophisticated. - You steal that one from home alone? - You fell for it, bitch. If you wanna see your son - You're not calling the shots anymore. - As long as I have LJ. As long as I got Whistler, you'll do exactly what I say. Got it? Listen up. We're at an abandoned warehouse from the barrios interchange. - be there in 20 minutes with my son. - And once I get there? So now we wait. Think this'll work? Yeah, it'll work. You, me and LJ. I just hope it works out for McGrady, too. They must have closed all the roads out of Panama. Papa, what do we do? You gotta turn around, papa. I can't go back to Sona. I can't! I don't care what he says! He's a convict! He's a piece of garbage! I don't know anything about this Michael Scofield. General. Here is everything we have on the escaped prisoners. You don't know Scofield, is that right, Jorge? You sure you don't want to change your story, Fernando? This should help make you a decent brace. Thank you. We should be able to see them coming from up here. You know You did great. Thanks. I just want LJ back, you know? It's just a matter of time. Considering I don't have a pony in this race I guess this is where we say good-bye. Think I am going to let you just walk out of here? After what you did to us? What you did to my dad? I was gonna kill you at the beach, but I didn't want to do anything that was gonna get us caught. You shot my dad in the back. I'm gonna give you the courtesy you never gave him. Now, turn around. Turn around. Linc, think about what you are doing. I was told to choose between your family and mine. That was my option. I chose mine. Go to hell. Linc, you don't have to do this. Hey! My truck! What are we gonna do now?
