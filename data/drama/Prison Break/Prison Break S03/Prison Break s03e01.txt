                    			Do something, my brother is innocent! - He's American - I can't do anything. Yes! Back at the crime scene, - that'll prove - I'm a night clerk. You want someone who can do something, wait for the consul. He gets in in the morning. I'm sorry. That ain't gonna cut it. Your brother, - where do they have him incarcerated? - Sona. What? The worst of the worst are there, men no other prison will take. They rioted so badly a year ago, the guards pulled out, just left them to themselves. A thousand thieves, rapists, murderers. The government just stays back, keeps the perimeter. To them, Sona's a one-way street. What goes in never comes out unless it's dead. Somebody wasn't diligent enough with this guy, and we need him moved to a facility that's a little more moderate. All right? Thank you. Alright, the good news is as of yesterday you're a free man. - You got nothing to worry about. - Just my brother. Right. Well, that's a heck of a story, you two. That made the news even down here. And I understand you also have a son? LJ Lincoln Jr.? He must be ecstatic about your exoneration. - Still trying to reach him. - Tell us where he is. We'll send Let me handle that. Let's just focus on Michael. Okay, well, good news is is that much of what you're saying is checking out at the crime scene. The victim did have a service revolver with U.S. government numbers on it. And if a weapon was found, then that lends real credence to self-defense as a motive. Great. Did they find anything else? - Like what? - A bag. - What was in it? - A little money. No, sorry. - Of course they didn't. - Yeah, well, whatever the case, regarding Michael, I've managed to make a little headway. I arranged the transfer of your brother to another facility tomorrow. - It's a lot safer, it's a lot cleaner. - Great. And if this is stacking up like I think it is, I'd be pretty confident the charges will be dropped. He'd be free? Well, he'd still face charges in the U.S. - But out of there? - Yes. Is there is there a mess hall here? Mess hall? And some water. I'm dying of thirst. Please. Please. There's some water. Bite me. - What'd you say? - I didn't say nothing. Drink it. You hear me? Drink! Hey, get used to it, man. I haven't eaten for days. Come on. - How are you doing? - What do you want, Alex? You're so clever Planting the drugs on the boat. That's a big irony. Lawman in jail. You are exactly where you belong. No, you're wrong. And you're gonna help me. I will have a court date one day, and you will be there on the stand. And you'll tell the truth, that you planted this and you set this up, and I'm gonna go home. That's funny. I could have sworn you set this up. I set this up? I'm in here. What does the Company want with me? Why Panama? What, you think I know what they wanted? They had me. I did what they asked me to do: arrest you in Panama and hand you over. That's it. That's That's old news, huh? This is the first day of the rest of our lives. How about we work together, help each other out. Except every time I look at you, all I can see is the man who killed my father. You're on your own. Sign here to say that once inside, you're on your own by the law, you're not protected by the military in case of an assault. Any attempt to assist an inmate trying to escape will be met with a lethal response. Wouldn't dream of it. So So Feel like I'm on the wrong side. - You're on the right side. - You're not. - Gonna break me out? - Too tiring. All that running. Yeah, well, maybe you should have lost the cowboy boots. You scared? I'm getting you out of here, man. The Consulate's arranged to transfer you to a safer facility until the trial which is about a month. - They say you got a good chance. - When's the transfer? Tomorrow. Just just hold on, man, one more day. You know, I keep waiting for you to mention a certain someone. - I don't know where she is, man. - Well, you got to find her. I will. She's important to me, Linc. If anything happens to Sara It's going to be fine, man. I promise. I'll see you tomorrow. All right? American, right? I love America. NBA. Tracy McGrady shooting the ball in the hoop from downtown. Whatever you're selling, I'm not buying. Selling? I just want to talk basketball. Who's your team? Let's go, blanco. Orientation. - I'm not interested. - It's not for you to decide. Bring them in. I hope they haven't been treating you too poorly. I should hear of it if you have. I think as you can tell, Sona is unlike any other place in the world. Since the riots of last year, they left us here to rot. They figured we would just destroy ourselves, but instead, we've thrived. With the canal, Panama is now a breeding ground for international crime. But not one gang. Not one racially-motivated incident. It's just me. Egalitarianism I believe is the word. - Did I get that right? - Right as rain. That's what practice does for you. Now, is there anything you want to tell me? Any history that you bring to this place that I should know about? I don't think you're quite telling me the truth. We get the news, man. You were quite the superstar on CNN. Man breaks brother out and flees to Panama. But you're not a superstar here! - You realize that, don't you? - I'm not going to make waves. It wouldn't be within your power. I heard about the two of you. You two in the hall today. Now, if you'd like to sort your problems out, it's very simple here. A man has a beef with another, he makes his problem known. And then we deal with it directly as men over there. Won't be necessary. You always shake like that? Or just when you're scared of someone? I think he gets the message. We could go You and me right here. You're a brave man, huh? You're lucky I've been meditating. Before, I couldn't take my finger off the trigger, but now, now, I have mind control. Complete control. Mind body and soul. Get out! He's a waste of our time. Who would have thought a famous person in Sona. Weak people rally around fame. They worship it. They're blinded by it. There are many people of weak character behind these walls. Yes, they will follow a man like this, and they will put him on a pedestal. He has that charisma, right, mami? He's no you. You don't have to pander me, mami. He's good looking, right? He's the best looking man in the prison, right? Not compared to you. I told you, mami Sara Tancredi she's an American. She's missing. We don't have a report of anything like that. But if you do, you call me. The number's on the back. - Anything, you call me, alright? - Will do. Thank you. Where'd you get shoes? It's time to start earning your rent, here. - There's no rent, it's prison. - Keep talking. It's going up. Here. Work time's started right now. Where? - Hell no. - Absolutely not. One more word from you, and I will drown you in here, you understand? Now, work. Burn it down in the sewers when you're done. - Elliot Pike. - What do you want? Well, to be frank, to represent you. - You're a lawyer? - Of sorts. The court already appointed me a lawyer. Then perhaps I can be of assistance in a different way. Somehow I doubt that. I got a lot of big guns behind me, Mr. Scofield, people you might like to have in your corner should you ever decide, say to break out of here. Who are you? We can assist you in every possible way once you get past that wall. There's a reason a guy like you, with your skill set, was put in here, you know. This conversation's over. You should listen to what I have to say. We're trying to do this the easy way! What the hell are you doing taking my stash? Cough it up, you bitch! - I didn't do it. - Where is it? - Where is it? - It wasn't me. You know the rules about extra-curricular fights! It doesn't happen here. - He took something that belongs to me. - He's out of his mind. It seems pretty easy to get to the bottom of this check him. Check his area. That's bull. You're both scumbags. You and me, man, we're not done here. You haven't seen her? No one like this has checked in? You're absolutely sure? Thanks. Yeah. Mr. Burrows. Captain Itzuris at the constable's office. We found an American woman matching the description of your friend, Ms. Tancredi. Where? At the morgue. What's he saying? That we can't eat. What are we supposed to eat? They expect us to forage, like dogs. I'll die. I will literally die. Hang in there, man. Playing by yourself. Same old Pretty. Just not good at making friends, are you? We got nothing to say to each other. On another note, them big government types that shook me so hard, why did they wanted you here? Was it Sona they was interested in? I'm wondering. Want me to get you down here, in this very county. What do you think it is? You think it's Sona? Who'd be interested in a dump like this? Runner! Runner! - Thanks for getting back to me. - No problem. The body was fished out of the pond this morning. Where? Calle Sesenta-Seis. Just west of Avenida Colon. Sir? That's the last place I saw her. It's not her. It's not her. Someone's thrown the glove down on you. The gauntlet, right? Yeah, except we both know I didn't take those drugs. I'm not the judge. I don't deal in the claims people make. I just make sure the rules are followed. And the rules say all grievances are dealt with two men in a ring, a fight. I'll be leaving tomorrow, so that won't be necessary. It may not be necessary to you, but it is to me. I have a duty to maintain order here an ironclad legal system that assures that no one goes independent with their grievances, as is so often the case in other prisons. Here, there is a system, and that system means order. So whether you agree with it or not does not matter to me. There's a larger agenda than yours. What happens if I refuse? We'll come for you. And I can guarantee you that is an outcome that you will not like. Tell me something do you always set up your fights? I had nothing to do with it. And yet the only one in this prison who has a problem with me is you. I'd be glad to see you go down superstar. Go on, keep going. You burn it around the corner. Think you can do me a favor? Bite me. I can feed you. A few weeks ago, I was in your shoes. Didn't get any food for days. They'd have let me die, just like they're gonna let you die. Get back to the "feed me" part. Chicken. Man, where'd you get chicken? That's not chicken. Want some more? Then you're gonna have to run an errand for me. What kind of errand? - Dad? It's me. - LJ. - Where are you? - I'm in Panama. What? How - How'd you get this number? - I ran into Sara. The consulate gave her your number. - Dad, I'm cutting out. - LJ? - I can't hear you. - Dad, do this. Meet us at the restaurant in the Garfield Price building, - at the top. - Garfield what? 8:30 Time to fight, blanco. Best to make your peace with God. Uno, dos, tres, all right? What? Even at 10-1? There's a reason he chose World. Six consecutive life terms, okay? I'm just kidding, man. Tranquilo! Surely, it's beneath a man of your status to be walking around like that all sticky-like. Leave him. What do you propose? Ablution. A humble sign of friendship from a stranger who's come into your house. Sorry about that. Just half a man down here. What's your name, norteño? You can just call me "friend." Go for the kneecap. You You hit it straight on, it'll buckle, and you'll take the guy out of commission. Fighting dirty? That's your secret? I didn't think there was any such thing as clean in a place like this. You know, I'm surprised, Alex. It almost sounds like you care. You're my get-out-of-jail-free card. Just survive. Kneecap, really hard. Good luck, man. God bless, man. We got a disagreement between two dogs. A drug addict and a thief. And I condone neither. And I wash my hands of both of them. But they have an issue, and we have rules. And without rules, we're nothing but savages. Therefore, with proper respect for the rules, this fight is engaged with only one rule: no weapons. Only man versus man, without augmentation or handicap. I'm done talking. I'm not gonna fight! I don't think you understand the rules, friend. Only one man comes out alive. No weapons! Rules are rules, remember? If we don't have them we're savages. Excuse me. You have no jacket. I'm just meeting someone. Give me a break. Well, this is a nice place. It requires jackets. - I don't have a jacket. - It requires jackets. Fine. Excuse me. You speak English? How about American? Can I grab a water, please? Please, tell me you didn't come all the way to Panama for the water. Family. That's a nice jacket Sergio. It's a long story. Thank you. You're waiting for someone? I should have known. Good-looking ones are always taken. What happened to your face? - A cat. - Cat? It's a big cat. You push anything too far into a corner, and the claws will come out. - Your timing's all wrong, lady. - Come on. Hang out. I'd like to but it ain't the right time. Yes, it is, Lincoln. We have a lot to discuss. Specifically, your brother. I highly suggest you talk to him. How are we coming with the transfer? There are some people that want you to break someone out of there. Yeah, I know. Some guy approached me. I said, "No, thank you." You gotta stay. What are you talking about? His name's James Whistler. No, Linc, I can't do that again. Talk. Dad! Dad, I'm so sorry. They got me and Sara. Please, do what they want. Dad, please. You got a week to find this Whistler guy. Get him out of there. Otherwise, they Sara and LJ they both die.
