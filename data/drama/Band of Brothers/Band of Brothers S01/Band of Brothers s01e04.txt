Replacements



                    			The Toccoa men, that's the ones that was there at the very beginning.  They are very close.  They accept people coming in, like myself, as a replacement. . .  . . .but you also had to prove yourself.  Most of them were qualified parachutists. They had to be.  A lot of them were awfully green, and we knew that.  We hoped they could keep alive.  A lot of them didn't.  But after a while, they eventually blend right in.  l think maybe they were trying. . .  . . .to impress the older guys, people like me or Shifty.  l don't know why, but l got to where. . .  . . .l didn't wanna be friendly with replacements coming in. . .  . . .because, God, l didn't like seeing them get killed. lt just tore me up.  We were in awe of them. They were wearing infantry badges.  They had a star on their jump wings.  They were heroes to us. That's how we saw them.  And they were good. They were good.  We had good officers, but we had excellent NCOs.  They looked after you.  All right, now, lieutenant, nice and easy. We still got a shot.  Tough break. You're having a tough night.  -Sorry, George. -lt's all right.  -Nice shot, sir. -Thank you, Bull.  -Thank you. -Heffron, finish me up.  -What does he need? -Double seven.  There it is!  You're embarrassing the lieutenant. Drink.  Don't mind if l do.  Better start winning money, your pals miss you.  -Yeah, they do look kind of sad. -They're just serious fighting men.  l'll introduce myself.  Be careful. Don't take much to set my guys off.  You got some wild-eyed killers there.  -Good thing we weren't gambling. -We'd have gotten killed.  -You wanna bet? -A pack of smokes.  -l don't know. -Come on.  -First one to hit the bull's-eye? -One shot.  -Why not? Make it two. -Two packs.  -Yeah, two packs. -All right, two packs. One shot.  Hey, fellas. What do you hear? What do you say?  -That's Babe's seat. Private Heffron's. -ls that right?  l don't care if it's fucking Eisenhower's.  -Who are you? -Private Miller. James Miller.  -l'm in Randleman's squad. -Us too. l'm Les Hashey.  -Tony-- -Garcia. l know.  Old Gonorrhea don't miss nothing.  Lieutenant, you gonna shoot lefty all night?  -Come on. -Because he's right-handed.  What would l do without George Luz?  Goodness gracious! Two packs, gentlemen. Pay up.  -So Heffron tell you about Doris yet? -No.  Well, then l'm gonna educate you.  We're ready to get on the plane for the first jump.  All of a sudden, Heffron stops.  Boom. Everybody banging into each other.  Heffron's staring at the airplane's nose, because on it. . .  . . .is painted this beautiful pinup. Written underneath: ''Darling Doris. ''  Doris just happens to be the name of the skirt who just that day. . .  . . .sent Babe one of them letters. You know them--  Web, what do you call them letters?  -Dear John letter. -That's it. A ''Dear Babe'' letter.  Anyway, lucky for Babe, Patton overruns our drop zone.  Mission canceled. Babe don't have to risk getting inside Doris again.  Bull, your squad listens good.  They're being polite, like whenever Bull opens his mouth.  They're just humoring him?  Yeah, like whenever he gives out some of his folksy farm wisdom.  Probably think he's a fucking hayseed. Ain't that right?  What are you laughing at?  You new boys, you pay attention to Sergeant Randleman. Got that?  That's the smartest man in the company.  Where'd you get that?  lt's the Presidential Distinguished Unit Citation.  -For what the regiment did in Normandy. -Right. For what the regiment did.  -You weren't there. -Ease up, Cobb. lt's a unit citation.  Shit, Cobb. You didn't fight in Normandy, neither.  l got hit in the plane before l got a chance to jump.  Hey, you all! Listen up! l got us an announcement to make.  -This is Carwood Lipton. -He's already married, Smokey.  This here is Carwood Lipton, the new Easy Company first sergeant!  As befitting his position, he says he has to make an announcement.  Well, l hate to break the mood here, boys, but we're moving out again.  As you can see. . .  . . .this is called Operation Market Garden.  For airborne divisions, this one's bigger than Normandy.  We're dropping deep into occupied Holland.  The Allied objective is to take this road between Eindhoven and Arnhem. . .  . . .so the two British armored divisions can move up it.  Our job is gonna be to liberate Eindhoven. . .  . . .stay there, wait for the tanks.  The entire European advance has been put on hold for this operation.  lt's Montgomery's plan, we'll be under British command.  The good news is, if this works, these tanks will be heading into Germany.  That could end the war and get us home by Christmas.  lntelligence doesn't expect much opposition.  They think the Krauts there are mostly kids and old men.  We should surprise them.  Say goodbye to England, l don't think they're gonna call this one off.  -What are you doing? -Look at Cobb, man.  Watch and learn, kids. You wanna live, jump ready to fight.  Who let you out of the hospital like that?  They didn't let me out. l busted out.  l didn't wanna get reassigned.  -Can you make the jump? -Sure l can, Lip. l just can't sit.  -Welcome back, Popeye. -Thanks.  -Popeye went AWOL just in time to jump. -What's he doing here?  Who, Sobel? Well, he's the newly appointed regimental S-4.  -Supply officer? -Yeah, you got it.  He picked me up in Aldbourne.  -He know you went AWOL? -He knows.  He said l was lucky. l could sit out this jump if l wanted.  -l didn't want to. So he says, ''Hop in. '' -''Hop in''?  Yeah, l couldn't believe it. Maybe he'll court-martial me later.  Let's get you some gear.  Hey, Mal, over there.  Son of a bitch.  Malarkey.  -Sergeant Malarkey. -Sir.  You thought you'd get away with it?  What do you mean, sir?  That motorcycle is U.S. Army property.  That may not mean anything to you, but it does to me.  Where'd you find it?  -That's him, all right. -Who is he, sarge?  -He was our first C.O. -What happened?  He got promoted.  Just tap my leg, sergeant.  -Lieutenant, you'll be in the doorway. -Yeah, l know. But, look, sergeant. . .  . . .you'll be behind me. When the green light comes on, just tap me, all right?  -The light will be next to you. -Do it. That's an order.  Come here.  When you land, the end will hit your knee and break your jaw.  Lose your reserve. You won't need it, we're jumping low. You're fine.  Come on.  -l'm sorry, sergeant. -Don't be. Grab your rifle, let's go.  Where'd you get that from, Hoobler?  l think l love Holland.  -Where'd you get these? -That farmhouse over there.  Just sitting out in the open. l don't know. . .  . . .maybe they were expecting us.  Boys.  l made it!  l wonder if they hit anything.  Goodbye, air support.  There's some kind of holdup ahead. We're going in through this field.  Move out! Able Company, let's go! Move it! Move it!  Won't be able to shoot as straight with that on.  Okay, hold your fire.  Hey, kid!  -Bull!

Thank you. -Thank you.  Thank you, you're very kind.  -What's up, Welshy? -Snipers.  We've gotta get to these bridges.  All right.  Hashey.  -Watch the camera. Ready? -Okay, everybody, here we go.  Sergeant Talbert, let's move! We got work to do.  -What did they do? -They slept with the Germans.  The men who collaborated are being shot.  Mr. van Kooijk here is with the Dutch Resistance.  We've been waiting for this day for almost five years.  He can help us secure the bridges.  Yes. Together we can push the remaining Germans out of Eindhoven.  -Any idea where they might be? -We're still working on that right now.  His friends are gathering information.  His contacts saw the British 2nd and Guards Armored pass half an hour ago.  -They're kids. -These are reliable reports.  Anything we can do to help you, we will do. Anything.  Right on time.  Captain.  l'll be happy to show you the quickest route to the bridges.  Glad to have your help.  Get scouts to the town's edge in case we spend the night.  Hey, van Klinken.

A little bit. -What were you doing down there?  lt's an air-raid shelter. We've been in there since the planes flew over.  We're Americans. Paratroopers.  -The Germans are gone? -Think so. You see any, let us know.  -You here to stay? -Long as we have to.  -Yeah, they don't tell us very much. -Or feed us much.  Please, wait here.  -See that? l say screw Paris. -Don't talk about screwing, all right?  They all speak English and love us. What a great country.  Take a look.  -Here.

Danke. -Yeah.  -Zigaretten? -Yeah.  He never tasted chocolate.  lt's pretty good, isn't it?  -Oh, man, you know, l hate eggs! -Here, sarge, you can have this one!  -Vincent van Gogh was born in Nuenen. -Yeah?
