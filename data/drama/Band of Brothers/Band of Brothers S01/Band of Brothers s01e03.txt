Albert Blithe.  You know why you hid in that ditch, Blithe?  l was scared.  We were all scared.  You hid because you think there's still hope. But, Blithe. . .  . . .the only hope you have is to accept that you're already dead.  The sooner you accept that, the sooner you'll function as you're supposed to.  Without mercy. Without compassion. Without remorse.  All war depends upon it.  Got any smokes? You want some of this candy?
