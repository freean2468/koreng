Bastogne



                    			When we left for Bastogne, we were short of equipment.  We didn't have enough ammunition or warm clothes.  But we had confidence. . .  . . .that our higher military authorities would get to us whatever we needed.  There was a ridge with a tree line. We were dug in there.  The Germans knew where we were and they gave us a shellacking.  ln Bastogne we were down to one round per man there for a while.  The fog was in. They couldn't resupply us.  When they tried to drop supplies in. . .  . . .they'd miss and drop them to the Germans.  One guy got hit by shrapnel. Took his arm off above the elbow.  They were taking him out and he said, ''Get my watch off my arm. ''  A medic came along and he really saved my life.  He stuck a Syrette in a key position. Morphine.  Even today on a real cold night, when we go to bed. . .  . . .the first thing l'll say is, ''l'm glad l'm not in Bastogne. ''  Doc, doc, doc.  Doc, bandage. Take him back to Regiment.  -Gen. McAuliffe, division commander. -Give it to me straight.  We've been taking ground in one position, losing it in another.  Now we're digging in on the edge of the forest.  We're under sporadic artillery fire. We're taking hits with no aid station.  We have no food or winter clothes, and little ammo.  The line's spread so thin the enemy wanders into our CP.  We just can't cover the line.  Morning, Captain Nixon. You got anything for Gen. McAuliffe?  Yes, sir.  General, l took a walk on our line about 0300 last night.  l couldn't find the 501 st on our right flank.  We've got considerable gaps in our perimeter.  l don't have enough people, sir. We're spread too thin.  Hold the line, colonel. Close the gaps.  This fog won't lift anytime soon, so you can forget about air cover.  Krauts on their tail.  Tanks. Artillery. Got no backup. There's a lot of shit headed this way.  Doc?  Can l scrounge a bandage from your aid kit, sir?  How are you fixed?  No plasma, couple of bandages, practically no morphine.  l tried to find my way up to 3rd Battalion for supplies. . .  . . .but l lost my way.  lf you can't get over to 3rd. . .  . . .Doc Ryan will fix you up with what he can spare.  Thanks, captain.  Eugene? Get everything you can. You're gonna need it.  -Spina. -Doc.  -What's happening? -We're digging in along the line.  Yeah, this is it. So, what'd you get?  l got this, and l got myself a Kraut bandage.  -What?

Two medics in one hole? -Yes, sir.  What's gonna happen to us if you take a hit, huh?  Sir?  -First Sergeant, where's my foxhole? -lt's back here, sir.  Maybe you missed it, huh? l'll walk you back.  -You're a bit close to the line here. -Goddamn it.  Sgt. Guarnere, did you keep any morphine?  -No. Doc, l gotta talk to you. -How's that leg?  -Forget the leg, l'm pissing needles. -Later.  -You seen them? -No.  But they're out there. Depend on it.  -Cup of Joe, doc? -Gordon, l need sharp scissors.  Scissors? Well, let's see, l'll have to check the sewing room.  Might be upstairs in the study, the desk drawer.  All right. What about an extra Syrette in your aid kit?  Hide your morphine, guys--  -Muck, you okay? -l'm good.  -Malarkey!

Just a kid.  The only virgin l know is the Virgin Mary.  Hey, Babe. Where the hell are we?  This way.  -l don't like it. -Where the hell is 3rd Battalion?  -Shit. -Come on.  Give me a hand.  Go. Go.  -Come on, Spina. Move. -l'm moving. l'm moving.  We can spare a few bandages, but that's it. No morphine.  -Go back to Bastogne for plasma. -Bastogne?  -Doesn't your surgeon have plasma? -We don't have one.  -Just me and my buddy. -Sorry, but we can't help you.  Take cover!  Get your butts out of here!  -Let's go. -Go! Move!  -Should have shot Hinkle in the ass. -Hinkle nearly shot him.  God bless you.  -These smell like my armpit. -At least your armpit's warm.  -You want syrup with that? -What's in these?  -Nothing you won't eat, Malarkey. -l won't eat Malarkey.  -Maybe Hinkle would like your share. -l should have shot him.  -Anybody seen Lieutenant Dike? -Try Battalion CP, sir.  -Try Paris. -Try Hinkle.  Hinkle, l'm home.  Eugene, Lt. Dike's got a full aid kit.  -He's not using his. -Maybe Hinkle's got a Syrette.  -Eat your strudel. -Hinkle Vinkle, eat ze armpit, huh?  Lieutenant Dike.
